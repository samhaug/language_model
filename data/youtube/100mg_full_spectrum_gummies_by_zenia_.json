{"fXqFWTGU-_s": "This video is all about full spectrum CBD oil benefits What is full spectrum CBD oil and why is it better than regular CBD oil? Check it out. Hey guys My name is Johnny Ross. I am a student at the University of Kentucky right now And I just did some research on CBD so that you don't have to if anything in this video is helpful for you I would really appreciate it if you would stop by my subscription button over to onder and Smack it maybe leave a comment leave a like if you don't like it. Let me know why share the video Don't forget to stay to the end because there is CBD there so full spectrum CBD oil is a type of CBD oil So if you're not really sure what CBD oil is in general, you can check out the video in the card above Basically CBD is one of 104 cannabinoids which are chemical compounds found in the cannabis plant These cannabinoids are particularly Medicinally useful for things like pain recovery mental clarity Inflammatory relief depression and anxiety relief and a ton of other cool stuff CBD is really helpful for humans full-spectrum CBD oil is CBD oil that has been extracted from the cannabis plant which includes all of the chemical compounds that the plant produces this includes terpenes flavonoids cannabinoids fatty acids and even THC when you extract all of the compounds from cannabis in Context of each other. They're more beneficial for you therapeutically Did you say that was th seed that now I did say there's THC in there Some people want THC free oils and that's totally understandable but a lot of times the THC content in a Seabee full-spectrum CBD oil is actually Point 3 percent or less so it's a trace amount of THC at best and it's not going to get you high You're not gonna feel any of the effects of that but it is going to help with the context of all the medicinal benefits that all the cannabinoids terpenes and flavonoids have for within that CBD or full-spectrum CBD oil is different from broad-spectrum CBD oil and CBG isolate exactly as it sounds is 99.9% CDD it usually comes in a powder looks a little bit like cocaine, but it's not cocaine It's CBD. It has wonderful healing effects for you but you do put it on your gums or under your tongue broad spectrum CBD oil is a CBD oil that has been doctored to contain many of the cannabinoids terpenes or flavonoids But they are usually select by whoever's mixing them or producing them and very generally speaking Broad-spectrum CBD oils and never have THC not even a little bit So you might ask why should I care? because full-spectrum CBD oil is actually clinically proven to be more beneficial for you than CBD isolate or even broad-spectrum a study that I'm going to put in the link in the description compared CBD isolate effectiveness to Full-spectrum effectiveness, they found that CBD was producing anti-inflammatory and anti What when they increase the dose there was a drop-off in the effectiveness they then remedied this by adding CBD to a full plant extract full-spectrum CBD and the dosage and effectiveness both rised together so like I was saying CBD in the context of all of the chemicals that the plant cannabis Produces is more effective than CBD itself, and I just wanted to show you guys this it's not Super relevant, but it is relevant. There's a website that has a terpene slider so you can go see what effects you want And then it will tell you what terpenes and flavonoids that you should get in your oils That's pretty freakin. Cool cannabis has over 400 known chemical compounds that it produces the majority of medicinal benefits come from cannabinoids like cannabidiol and THC terpenes and flavonoids also have medicinal benefits, but they're not unique to cannabis A lot of essential oils are actually made from terpenes and flavonoids These chemical compounds are generally responsible for the way that a plant or oil smells or tastes Flavonoids are more responsible for the things but pigmentation as well So what colors are in your plant because full-spectrum CBD oil comes from a certain plant. It is actually very important to know what strain your CBD oil is coming from so You know what specific medicinal or therapeutic properties that you're getting in that oil because it's relevant to the genetics of the strain of cannabis That it came from that's what I got for you guys today except for one more thing Which is a link in the description to get some broad-spectrum CBD oil from a veteran-owned American company that sells CBD called pure American hemp oil Try them out first link in the description below and generally thank you guys so much for listening once again I appreciate your time. If you appreciated this time with me that we spent together just now intimately consider subscribing consider leaving a comment nasty or nice doesn't matter and leave a like or just keep watching different videos on my channel because they're interesting and maybe they would Benefit you Thanks for watching guys. Peace If you're not really sure what CBD oil is you can watch this video right here click the card above and Eat my the majority of medicinal benefits come from cannabinoids like cannabis can it be debited can't cannabidiol and THC", "8G0uy08bGNo": "[Music] welcome back so today well yesterday we went to see bd+ and got some new and goodies he decided to try out some new radicals there little gummies yeah squid yep and so there are 10 milligrams per serving and there's ting servings in each pack yeah and they are full spectrum hemp so it does have less than point 30 percent THC in each serving but for us today we're gonna take the little thing just because 10 milligrams of CBD with how much we have been smoking it and everything isn't gonna do much for us so for it to really work and has to give you the full effect how did you open pictures open [Music] and yes it for me I have the blue raspberry I have the Concord grape and what's interesting about them is like they're colored with natural products mine's colored with cabbage as far as like rubbish yes that's interesting okay so yeah it comes out as these little video gummies I don't know even how to do the individual servings personally you try it yeah you'd have to definitely cut it it does have like little marks to show you like where to cut but don't think that's easy to pull apart that's all good I just say you can definitely do the CBD in there but you can taste how much more natural it is is there seriously like a handful of ingredients there's coconut oil full spectrum hemp extra citric acid organic sugar and water I mean I teach a little bit I taste a little bit of the grape yeah yeah so way to go lunchbox alchemy yeah these are really good so we are at our local mall and we're just gonna kind of walk around I was wanting it to go into forever 21 to see if they have plus-sized stuff for me to try on and probably get some lunch since we have an 8 today it's up for this yeah but alright guys so we'll see you in a bit later so now we're like in the middle towards the end of our walk we've come to a few different stores yeah I still hopefully energetic yeah we walk it's more the only reason why we're stopping is because I decided to wear my combat boots today and they're happy on my feet so they're beautiful yeah you know it's all aesthetic and cute but I'm just not very cute oh yeah and right now we're about to go and Macy's and I'm gonna try to spray the fragrances to you know compare from my shop right yeah and we back in the cop sorry that the lighting is a little weird the sun's like in a weird spot right now but there you go yeah we're back in the car I got to finally smell my Viktor & Rolf bonbon so good I knew that had to be I've looked at what's all in it it's good just don't we're at the price I just can't spend there it's been sitting us to get a fragrance rate like that whenever I spray for you freely all day long he has to over all those gummies definitely helped highly recommend it tastes good - yeah they tasted really good the only thing that I think people are gonna have a problem with is the splitting just because it is a gummy so I think you've been cutting it will be a little difficult but the only way I can see possible is to cut into it Jonathas definitely from TV first for telling us about them yes and I will be linking in our description exactly where you can get it online on CD plus stop yeah I know let's say it's a we're delighting right now yeah thank you guys so much and we will see you next time and remember to spread the peace in that we do best my guys later [Music]", "hn7KXpJiAnA": "test test test light light light light record record record i sent seven cbd gummies to two independent labs to see if they're real i actually sent a bunch of gummies for testing from seven different cbd companies but you you know what i mean i tested them last year but i'm just getting the results up now because i'm lazy by the way i have a new channel that i'll link to below it's just for my own entertainment really i like making videos on investing okay i paid for the products i paid for the lab test and this is not sponsored youtube these uh tests are provided by certified labs for educational purposes only and i am not promoting these legal hemp products many of which you advertise on your platform so please don't censor this video pretty please thank you let's start with the biggest failure here everyone loves to see a train wreck right veritas farms failed the funny thing is that veritas means truth study your latin veritas farms 2f scores by two independent labs we are screwed no hey i don't want to hear that defeatist attitude i want to hear you upbeat we're screwed when people ask me what the difference is between the independent labs that i pay directly versus the lab scores that companies pay for this this is it now if the gummies are not consistent if they're not thoroughly mixed they may see large differences in both lab scores not all gummies are equal when they're not all mixed perfectly the lab scores will always be slightly different especially with edibles and i'm just reporting on the findings from two very credible labs in california gummies are different sizes slightly so we weigh them and average them out it's not perfect by any means however up to 95 percent more is bad like award-winning bad these gummies were supposed to be five milligrams but each lab found over nine milligrams of cbd no bueno not good because you don't know what what's going to be in your next gummy what will it have you don't know they have since updated their package to say 9 milligrams of cbd so i don't know if they accidentally gave me the new formula if they were in the middle of a change or what but this one is a no-go for me if you want to see the full review or any of the official lab tests head on over to cbdxamen.com also share this video to help this movement because people like you deserve to know if your cbd is real okay uh cbd living it's a big brand lab a lab a found 31 percent less lab b found 11 less i thought that was a little weird to be so far off meaning probably inconsistencies in the gummy so i did a really quick google search and i found at least six lab reports that found this company has issues that was just a few seconds of searching they failed a bunch of investigations like mine so you can read the whole review at cbdxamin.com but why why why do you want to know what this tastes like it tastes pretty good actually or what it costs it costs more than the average cbd gummy next next next let's just move on to the next we'll go with charlotte's web the biggest name in the hemp game they had about 20 more total cannabinoids than their label suggested which is typical of them i've tested a bunch of their product products over the years and they do run a little hot first off the label here says 10 milligrams and then 60 gummies everyone's going to think this has 600 milligrams of cbd but it only has 300 milligrams total right 300 milligrams on the front stop confusing people also tell me how much cbd is in each one and not just the total canned monoids but anyway small complaints it is 14.4 cents per milligram of cbd average is 13 cents according to my analysis of 450 cbd edibles charlotte's web is expensive but it is a premium brand so what are you gonna do now here's the deal with gummies this is the gram breakdown gummies are big so the amount of cannabinoids per gram is low it's below the reporting level for lab b for most of these other cannabinoids but it does add up it adds up because each gummy is four milligrams or four grams i should say a serving is two gummies eight grams so you're getting according to lab a 12 milligrams of total cannabinoids including 10.4 milligrams of cbd and 0.4 milligrams of thc that's nice plus 0.7 milligrams of cbc and a little cbg 0.12 milligrams of cbg so it adds up to a nice full spectrum but it's like they're low strength oils the dose the dose wise so just be aware that i showed the gram breakdown but the gummies each gummy is multiple grams depending on how big it is now this is actually good for gummies really good but charlotte's web is famous for their high levels of additional cannabinoids the question is for all gummies do you want to pay that much extra every day and obviously 10 milligrams of cbd is a lowish dose you can get their bigger potent oils for as low as 5 cents per milligram some brands go as low as 2 cents per milligram of cbd so 14 cents yeah it's a lot but uh these are gummies and not just oil gummies have added value because they taste good and these by the way taste great very smooth natural type of flavor made with beet sugar they are ginger flavor with a subtle turmeric taste just a little bit of that weird turmeric taste and just a tad of hem flavor but it's not it's not too bad for all the cannabinoids in here it's actually phenomenal i think it's great but if you don't like natural flavors you just get out of here walk away from this one oh and they also have a raspberry sleep flavor one sleep gummies these are fantastic they do help me with sleep most of the time they work not every time but most of the time and i think they taste a little better too raspberries are better flavor than turmeric right and there's only a few left that's how much i like them the one thing with all these gummies i chew on them and leave the juice in my mouth for a minute the capilla it sounds weird but the capillaries in your mouth are significantly better at absorbing cbd than your stomach is some studies show up to double the absorption rate i don't know what it actually is but it's a lot more than just eating cbd like like an animal like a savage animal just don't swallow it i don't know how am i supposed to say this so just don't swallow it for a minute don't edit that out now if you need large amounts of cbd you should really be using an oil also to find your correct dose an oil you can change the dose i was initially against gummies for that reason but i've been using all these gummies and more for the last six months and they're fun they're easy they taste good let's go the next one rnr medicinals i originally found this brand on amazon and i was shocked by how good their test results were they didn't list cbd levels on their website at the time which many companies don't because of marketing regulations so i couldn't give them a great review but now they are very transparent about cbd levels and they've got a usda organic cert and a us hemp authority search now these guys are less than half the cost of charlotte's web they're full spectrum well they have a fraction of the amount of additional cannabinoids that charlotte's web has at least in their gummies but that's normal they actually uh have more cannabinoids than the majority of other brands out there but it's still trace amounts 25 milligrams of cbd per gummy is strong that's a good dose i like that now if the lab shows it's five percent off that's still very accurate for edibles it's not going to be exact exact and their oils have shown that they test very accurately in the past now the good news is there's no hemp flavor they taste like those sour strips the sour belt candy that you would get at any big candy store if you want a lot of cannabinoids just get one of their oils and have their gummies for fun their oils have a ton of cannabinoids in a more than charlotte's web even and they're a fraction of the price of most companies gummies are for fun and these are a great price from a super consistent company with tons of positive reviews okay social cbd big brand this is broad spectrum meaning cbd and other cannabinoids but no thc and it does have zero thc and it looks like it's just isolated cbd that adds up to about 23 milligrams per serving and some isolated cbg which adds up to 1.36 milligrams per serving those really add up when you times them by 10 the serving is 10 grams or two gummies and that's a grand total of 24.28 milligrams of total cannabinoids so right on the money they're supposed to be uh 25 milligrams in a serving claimed not bad price is 9 cents per milligram under that 13 average so decent the red raspberry flavor taste was good i like it it's like a red vine zero hemp flavor yeah these are pretty good let's go with the next one cbdmd huge brand one of the first to go mainstream these tasted super good tropical mix from organic cane sugar and organic fruit no hemp taste zero hemp taste they say they're broad spectrum which should have other cannabinoids but this is just pure cbd that's typical of most broad spectrums and that's why i talk so much trash about most broad spectrums but who am i to judge how their marketing team uses cannabis terminology now cbd itself has no flavor so there's no reason all pure cbd products shouldn't taste this good but for some reason some cbd companies they just don't know how to do the candy business i tell you 10.4 cents per milligram is under the average 13 cents super accurate a scores from both labs and super tasty if you want pure cbd at an okay price this one's good okay next oh medterra you disappointed me not not in a bad way but this is one of my favorite companies this is the brand that i recommend most to people who can't have any thc in their systems drug tests or they're scared they might enjoy it too much or other reasons medterra is big reliable and they've tested squeaky clean at my labs in the past all their products have and that's why i recommend them for people that can't test positive for thc okay again they test accurately and it's uh they just have a little bit more and it's pure cbd a little cbdv is normal in those cbd isolates it's structurally similar to cbd and considered pure cbd over 27 milligrams per gummy it's supposed to be 25 milligrams so that's good tad more the price the price is under 5 cents excellent this would be my favorite for a pure gummy great company reliable it tastes like a gummy little gummy bear with no hemp flavor zero and but then they add l-theanine it's just an amino acid found in tea it can help calm you but these gummies have a slightly bitter aftertaste like tea i don't know if it's related to the l-theanine or not the taste is actually good overall it's um it's decent but why this is uh one of the best pure cbd companies out there that i've found why add other stuff to your product please medterra stop stop this madness and just make good old-fashioned cbd gummies with no added crap i do feel like it was calming like a natural calming so this is still an excellent product but just not for me okay that's it i think i like the charlotte's web the most just for all those uh extra cannabinoids even though it is weird with the tumeric and hemp taste but uh i wouldn't buy it personally because i'm cheap so uh for me i'd go with the uh the rnr medicinals personally it was just uh it's just like candy the cbd md that was which guy here cmd cbd md was good for uh pure cbd and it tasted good even though they lie about broad spectrum yeah who who am i kidding i'd uh i'd eat all of these i'll leave and probably eat the rest of these even though the lab says they're completely unreliable veritas okay i will see you next time you wonderful person you you", "gV4QzzgdKYk": "what's up CBD lovers welcome back to I love CBD alright so today is the long-awaited koi CBD Cummings reviews maybe not long-awaited for you but for me I was actually looking forward to doing this video this is it right here koi CBD gummies some very bold claims on the package it says America's best tasting CBD gummies by America's most trusted CBD brand definitely bold claims and you know we'll see how it holds up to these claims so this is the package this is a package it was just six I'll show you what the gummy looks like they only have a couple left yeah so they are round like this just a gummy it says coy on it even though for some reason I could have swore the first one I took didn't say anything on it I was looking forward to say coy like the picture but it didn't say anything so anyways these are the gummies there are six of them in this package total of 60 milligrams and packaged so each gummy has 10 milligrams of CBD and you know right off the back you take its gummy and the taste is okay it's not bad does have an aftertaste just like I don't know it's not it's not a sweet taste it's kind of like a little bit of bitterness or something or like yeah yes it's not a sweet taste there's definitely a very strong aftertaste but you know it's something you can deal with it's not something very terrible how are the effects on these gummies the effects are okay not bad you can definitely feel a calming effect definitely feel the anti stress and anti anxiety that you expect from CVD muscle relaxation and possibly some pain relief and stuff like that so the effects for a 10 milligram gummy are not bad now I don't have much to compare to as far as coming skull these are the first gummies 4cb gummies that I tried so the only thing that I compared to its capsules which is the same for more method of you know ingestion and comparing it to capsules it's okay you know it holds up it's not the top top or best but it's okay so just gonna keep this pretty short and if if I was to give us a rating my rating for this will be 4 out of 5 stars I don't mind that I would buy it again some reason it just keeps me how much I got this for I want to say it was like around 10 bucks or something no it wasn't ten bucks it was close to ten dollars I don't remember exactly how much it was it could have been ten dollars but a totally escaped it I mean totally escapes my mind right now so yeah that the price for it's just six gummies was not high but then again only has six gummies in there they do have a bigger package that I think has like 30 in there or something like that which is more expensive but I just wanted to try them out so this is it for koi CBD CBD gummies and my rating is 4 out of 5 stars I hope you find this useful if you're looking into buying these and if you like this video give it a like if you are not already subscribed and you like CBD like we do then subscribe and you stay updated with all my reviews all right I'll see you in the next video and I got some pretty exciting coming up and I'll see you guys later happy CBD", "dBJqb6_TaHw": "Full Spectrum CBD vs CBD Isolate. Hi, I am Matt and welcome to another CuredByNature\nepisode - CBD Frequently Asked Questions. After such a long time of cannabis stigma,\nthe truth is finally out. Cannabis is very good for the human body. Most of the people know about THC - the cannabinoid\nIn the cannabis plant that gets you high, right? One other cannabis component has been massively\nresearched for the past 30+ years, because of its health benefits. And that\u2019s CBD or Cannabidiol. And since CBD does not get you high or in\nother words, it\u2019s not psychoactive the way THC is,.. and because US president Trump signed\nthe new Farm Bill in December 2018, you can buy CBD products almost anywhere these days. From local health shops to different online\nshops. And believe it or not, the majority of the\npeople prefer not to be stoned or high all the time. That makes CBD products ideal cannabis products. You get the benefits of cannabis but without\nthe high. Now back to the subject\u2026 Full Spectrum CBD vs CBD Isolate\nIf you\u2019ve done just a little bit of research you know there\u2019s basically 2 kinds of CBD\nproducts. Products made with Full Spectrum CBD\nand Products made with CBD isolate. First the Full Spectrum CBD\nIt\u2019s also called Full Spectrum CBD Extract,... or Whole-plant CBD extract or FECO that stands\nfor Full Extract Cannabis Oil. It includes all of the cannabinoids found\nin the cannabis plant and also includes all the other components that get extracted out\nof cannabis flowers in the process. These other components are terpenes, waxes,\nhealthy fatty acids and chlorophyll. And you know what,... there are other components\nin the cannabis plant that get extracted in the process that we are not even aware of. But that\u2019s a story for another time. So when we say \u201cfull-spectrum,\u201d we\u2019re\nreferring to a naturally extracted spectrum rather than a constructed spectrum. Now let\u2019s talk about the CBD isolate:\nCBD isolate is just CBD. It\u2019s just cannabidiol molecule isolated\nor separated from other cannabis compounds in the plant. Now to the big question:\nWhat to choose - Full Spectrum CBD or CBD Isolate There are studies that give scientific proof\nthat Full Spectrum CBD that also includes low amounts of THC plus other cannabinoids,\nterpenes, etc. produce what is known as an Entourage Effect. The synergistic relationship between all of\nthe cannabis components has been shown to increase the healing properties of each. But when it comes to CBD isolate,... even\nthough it\u2019s fairly unlikely that you would fail a drug test or experience a form of \u201chigh\u201d\nbecause of the low amounts of the THC in those Full Spectrum CBD products,... some people\nprefer to be on the safe side. So now you have the information you need to\ndecide... CBD Isolate vs Full Spectrum CBD My suggestion is always Full Spectrum CBD. Why? Well, when it comes to health I don\u2019t think\nwe should hold back. This is a natural medicine and it just doesn\u2019t make any sense not to get the full benefit out of it.

Controlled Substances Act the USCS a hashtag feel the difference will roll around a little more supplement facts a serving size is two gummy bears so basically there are 30 servings in here 16 calories per serving so that's 16 calories for two gummy bears no fat 3.6 grams of carbs 2 grams of sugar 20 milligrams okay of hemp per serving and 10 milligrams of CBD per sir roll it around again and bang we're back to the front now for my favorite part I'm gonna go over some facts and eat a couple of these alright guys so as promised here it is got my facts sheet now just so I can make sure I'm telling you the right stuff so on the bottle you saw the CBD is legal that is used inside this product you may have looked and went well why is CBD legal you know I've heard the CBD isn't legal done it up let me go over that okay our products are exempt okay meaning CBD FX's products are exempt from the CSA and DEA s drug scheduling practices which classify whole half extracts as schedule one drugs because extracts from the stocks of European grown hemp are explicitly exempt from this scheduling practice and that is where the hemp is grown that these guys use to extract the CBD it is grown the biomass is over in Europe their product does meet the standards of the 2014 farm bills definition of compliant hemp which means it has to contain less than 0.3% of THC in the gamete or in the product period in the CBD oil period and again they only use CBD that is derived from a European biomass so that's how it's legal it is also non psychoactive and non psychoactive hemp was deemed legal by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2004 so there are your working facts now let me tell you a couple other things that are also some facts these things are freakin delicious alright the red they're my favorite color alright they taste like a fruit punch slash cherry I mean they're delicious so pop the cap you're gonna have a little safety seal I just normally yeah I just shut my thumb through here they gave me a couple bottles of these but I figured to show you your fresh bottle so pop it open and really they are little gummy bears I mean they look just like gummy bears and they basically tastes just like gummy bears except with a little pop so there you go it really is just a little gummy but I mean you know what I love these things so now that the FDA which you can and what you can't say let me roll that around so you get a nice glamour shot there since the FDA has determined what you can and can't say I'm just gonna tell you some personal experiences for me again I've been using CBD on and off three years what it does for me and in particular the CBD F FX products what they have done for me I used to be the guy that goes to bed let's say 10 o'clock at midnight I'm still up why cuz my brain won't stop okay it won't turn off I'm just going going going going going sit there flip through social media think about work think about this think about that couldn't shut my mind off I popped two of these half hour hour before bed I'm out and when I'm out I mean I am out don't wake up in the middle of the night no tossing no turning just everything just shuts down that's nice alright that's what I use it for also I work in a warehouse during the day yes that's right I am NOT the YouTube famous you know YouTube superstar I have a day job um and a work at a warehouse I do a lot of walking around you know up ladders down ladders all kinds crap I come home I am sore alright pop a couple of these takes the aches and pains away okay after a workout at the gym pop a couple of these takes the aches and pains away I mean it's not it's not a super drug but it takes the edge off for me okay other people you know say they use it for anxiety and stuff like that I don't really know if I have anxiety but I will say when I do take them it puts me in a just a nice mellow mood but it's not anything that you that you aren't functional you know I mean I could eat these in the morning before I go to work put in eight hours all day and still be totally fine doesn't make me drowsy even though it does help me fall asleep but the reason that helps me fall asleep like I says it just helps me turn my mind off so that being said I highly suggest you try something like I said if you're like me you don't like all the over-the-counter crap you think a lot of stuff that the doctors give is just you know blah blah mumbo-jumbo because they want you know Big Pharma wants to show some pills down your throat try these all right just try them what's the worst that's gonna happen it doesn't work for you okay sorry you know but I'm telling you most of the people that I talk to they've tried this it works for once you find out how many you actually need okay

and trust me on that it does work it really does I wouldn't I wouldn't I'm not the snake oil salesman all right so I'm just gonna be done trying to convince you hopefully you take my word for it and try some if you do want to try something check the description below you're gonna find a link directly to the big co website takes drinkler to the product buy it okay put it in your cart send it to your door try a couple gummy bears you know take the edge off guys just take the edge off all right so until next time it is your boy big J for VAP Co TV where you watch the side of a pan I am power [Music]", "K6p5tcWQ49Q": "I hope my name is Sydney and welcome back to our restart CBD YouTube channel today I'm going to be talking you guys about CBD edibles specifically the gummies that we offer here at researched CBD FDA disclosure representations regarding the efficacy and safety of restart CBD have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration we are not medical professionals and the information shared in these videos is based off of personal use and meant to be purely anecdotal please take everything we say with caution and do your own research before consuming CBD related products first things first full spectrum versus isolate if you want to know more about them you can check out our most recent video and we'll link it in the description below for you guys to follow along other than that I think we're just going to dive right in and show you guys what we have to offer so we're gonna start off with the isolate based products over here isolate no THC just CBD we offer two forms of gummies here at restart CBD our first what I'm going to talk about are these gummy bears they're 25 milligrams per gummy bear we sell them in a two-pack a 10 pack that looks just like this and then a 30 pack that looks like this one gummy per use just to start out again 25 milligrams is a great starting point especially for an edible with edibles the longer you chew it the longer you let it sit in your mouth the better absorption the better you're gonna have over time and really getting all the benefits of CBD after our gummy bears we have these CBD isolate fruits you choose the difference between the gummy bears and the Fruit Chews is simply just the milligrams per dose so the gummy bears again have 25 milligrams and these guys have 10 milligrams per we sell them in a two-pack that looks just like this and a 30 pack that looks like this and it's just a little more of a micro dose so if you're someone who responds to a little bit less CBD this might be the best bet brief you're someone who likes something a little bit more potent but 25 milligrams would be a great place to start and now going into our full spectrum gummies the same concept applies we have two versions with two different milligrams per dose the first one is very very similar if not identical to the isolate gummy bears these ones are 20 milligrams per gummy bear we sell them again in a two pack a ten pack that looks like this in this cute little tube and then a 30 pack of those 25 milligram gummy bears the second option that we offer here at restored CBD is a lower dose option these fruit gems are 15 milligrams per we offer them in a single a four pack and a ten pack and again these are 15 milligrams there is slightly lower dose there are much bigger gummies so if you're someone who likes sweets like to chew on something this one is your go-to and again these are both full spectrum so they contain that trace amount of THC under the legal limit of 0.3% alright so CBD edibles are extremely popular I think for good reason because they're usually very very tasty here at restart all of our edibles are organic they're made from the highest quality ingredients that we can find and I think one of the reasons to they're really popular is because they're so convenient you can take it in your bag cute aim to work with you you can travel with edibles and they're really really inconspicuous so you don't if you're someone who is uncomfortable with using an oilless something one with your tongue or even vaping in public these are a great go-to and they're already pre dosed

guys I'm Dan HOF key operating officer of honey stick as well as Gold Line CBD and in today's tutorial episode we are gonna be calling it CBD gummies for dummies why not because we're insulting anybody's intelligence but because we are gonna break down in a very simple fashion of exactly what the differences are between the different types of gummies available in the market one of the most common questions that we get to our Gold Line customer support is what I hear things like full-spectrum isolate coated infused gummies what's the difference what effect does that have on me and our CBD there's all these gummies out there and no real explanation on what the difference is they cost different they have milligrams so this episode is gonna break down the main categories and differences for gummies what does that mean for your CBD in a very simple to understand fashion and how does that affect your buying of your CBD your supplements whatever so basically we have a few major categories for CBD now a lot of the products you'll see out here if you're familiar Gold Line you will see from our website some of them are not offered on the website but they are prevalent in the market so I think it's important to have them out here so we can have a full discussion even outside of the things that our company is currently offering so you're properly educated on CBD so let's jump into it right away what are the major differences between gummies were the most common questions that I get is what is the difference between isolate gummies and full-spectrum gummies and it's really simple it's what type of CBD DEET is being used isolate gummies are generally made from biomass and it is synthesized off of different hemp products and the CBD is processed and extrapolated until it becomes basically a hundred percent pure a beedi and it's in almost a crystallized form and it's really easy to calculate it's very easy to make different solutions for your gummies it's a very good effective way to know how many milligrams you're gonna get and to make sure that there is absolutely zero THC within your gummies so for people who might necessarily get drug tested or not want to roll the dice on having even any traces of THC within their gummies or their CBD products that they're taking I select gummies are gonna be the way to go so when you're buying CBDs and you're asking your manufacturer like us questions then you would ask whether they have isolates or their full spectrum now what is full spectrum full spectrum is basically gonna have traces of THC however it's still gonna be below the legal limit which is 0.3% for hemp according to the US farm bill now that 0.3% is even below 1% so it is extremely small portion of THC however some people don't want any instead of being processed over the the full spectrum is actually taken from you know basically the live plants so generally when I select gummies are very high in CBD full spectrum and broad spectrum you know made based gummies that use that type of CBD they will have other things like CBN CBG CBC and different spectrums within the CBD category to give you a very complete form of all the different type of CBDs so let's say that you know full spectrum is more like a multivitamin if we're comparing the two different types of CBDs so our CBD is just specific you are getting your CBD and that's that so some people prefer the full and the broad spectrum for that reason and other people prefer the isolates because they don't want to roll the dice they just want to know exactly what they're getting and you are still getting the good effects the supplemental effects of CBD we won't go into what the different effects are people using gummies for different conditions or whatnot or CBD that's on you guys to research I'm not dr. Gupta I can give you medical advice or supplemental health advice but the differences are is full spectrum and isolate based the next large difference is is where the gummies are infused or whether they are coated some people use these terms not properly because they think that if it's infused with CBD that it is just CBD is on there so there's two ways of getting CBD within the gummies you can either coat them or you can actually infuse them to where it's like I like to compare to donut so I mean who doesn't love donuts coated gummy is like a glazed doughnut sort of flavoring and stuff it's put on the top and that's how those gummies are made is that they're made and they are basically sprayed or soaked with the CBD solutions and they get absorbed into the gummy and they're on the outside to infuse gummies they're more like a jelly doughnut to where the solution is on the inside the oil is on the inside and they've been either injected or it's been formulated into the actual compound of manufacturing the gelatin or the building block of the gummies so that is another key difference and between that people say were some of pluses and minuses pluses and minuses are as generally the ones that are coded on the outside those are generally less expensive so they're more budget-friendly however the ones are injected are usually a little bit more consistent so if you're buying a jar of 1500 milligram coated gummies some gummies might be a little bit stronger than the other depending on how they record or if they're touching the edges of the jar and some of the CBD mighta came off and beyond the jar so you might have to take one two more of the coded gummies - whereas some of them might be a little bit stronger so they kind of average out but if you're looking for super consistency then you want the infused got me the jelly donut because that is basically an exact amount that they put into the gummy so now with these examples let's go into you know what different types of gummies there are so outside of the full spectrum and isolate gummies and the coated and infused gummies now you have gummies in the categories of even flavoring so here we have our CBD Gold Line let's take a look at this half of the product line right here so here is basically our offering of CBD Gold Line now these are actually all isolate based gummies so these will have absolutely no traces of THC they have they have basically a total amount of milligrams that you will get per jar and we recommend that you take two to three gummies per serving so we have different textures for gummies our first one here is going to be our sour gummy which is going to be like I said these ones are an isolate based so they're gonna be the zero TAC you're gonna go ahead and open it here so these are gonna be like sour flavored gummies and they are coated with our Goldline CBD solution very clean job of openness let's get close-ups here you get several different colors and these are gonna be more sour and taste you're also gonna have a little outside sugar coating for a little bit of a little bit of extra flavor let's go ahead and take one out and get a real nice close-up if you're into the sour taste not just kind of a plain fruity taste this will definitely be up your Avenue and also sometimes the sour taste can offset any taste within to come with the CBD oils so even when you're dealing with full spectrum gummies and things like that if you have a sour bass gummy it can offset any type of you say I don't like the taste of natural CBD oil there's CBD solutions then a sour gummy might be or a sugar-coated gummy might be a good alternative for you to offset some of that taste so you get a more pleasant experience of Wired having your CBD then you have your natural gummy which is basically plain fruity flavor a lot of companies just in making gummies that aren't CBD infused make very similar gummies that your the taste will be familiar from any of the Albanese gummies and things that you can get from the supermarket except they have the added CBD and these have been coated not infused and they use isolates they have zero THC every once a while different isolate gummies have different solutions every once in a while you might get some type of you might think it's sugar it's crystal but actually the CBD isolates come in the form of CBD crystals so every once awhile it might not be uncommon to see crystals on the gummies it might not have gotten fully absorbed into the gummy or that might be on the outside when the CBDs are a hundred percent pure that they're like isolates it's not uncommon to see some crystals I don't see any on this gummy so everything was good but these are generally big fruity flavored gummies so they're there Jim a little bit more fluffy they have the fruity taste these aren't gonna be the sour gummies so let's go ahead and put this back and move along so on Goldline CBD we generally sell the gummies in two sizes we have a 12 ounce and an 8 ounce and also some smaller assortments generally it's you know more value driven to buy more but we have all the way down to I think 10 or 20 pack that you can buy or even a 5 pack that you can purchase on the website just a sample the gummy to see if you like it and then once you're a go we do all kinds of bundles and you can go up to 12 ounce which contains I think about a hundred and twenty gummies so here we did a limited run for the holiday season these are of our holiday gummies on top of being the large fluffier gummies and being you know of holiday colors which is a red white and green over here these are actually uh flavored also so they're gonna have the different a little bit more added fruity flavor into them so it is a little bit more of a premium gummy than your standard base gummy bears that uh that are used so it's gonna be a little bit of an upgrade but you're not gonna get any of the sour taste so you know what a lot of people and a lot of companies even outside of ours will do is they'll use different types of flavored gummies as their base so you can kind of know what gummy bears from going to the supermarket that you like or what type of tools you like when you're selecting your ideal CBD gummy and I hope it's a gold line but in the event that it's not look for that too when you're on the hunt for buying your gummies let's go a little close-up of these guys so you can see we have the red green and white give me a thumbs up that you got a good focus and other gummies so there you see we have the nicest Ortman they're a little bit fluffier in texture and they also have the added flavor infusion so you're gonna have a very flavorful experience with these holiday gummies and they're still available on our website I think for the whole month of January we continued producing them and once that goes away we'll probably still offer these gummies but they're not going to be holiday oriented maybe some Valentine's Day gummies so now moving right along to our full spectrum gummies these use a high quality of full spectrum oil and on top of that they are actually infused so they are injected into the gummy so each time you get a gummy these that we have here available in four flavors you're gonna get a very consistent 10 milligrams of CBD in each gummy now we used to offer a 25 milligram full spectrum going but a lot of people especially when it comes to full spectrum you can actually taste the CBD oil so taste a little bit more like a medical gummy so there's different things that you have to do to the gummy to offset the taste some people are really into it like the Colorado and California style gummies and that's kind of what it tastes like and some people would rather just have you know a flavorful experience as well so what we did was we realized is that instead of offering a 25 milligram gummy let's kick it down to a 10 so some of the oil taste is not as prevalent and we also have poor flavor so we flavor and fuse the gummies on top of it so let's go ahead and get a close-up of what's available here so we have cherry flavor fruit punch and also strawberry and an orange citrus I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going to lay each one of these out here on the table so you can see they're actually fruit shaped and the different flavor is actually indicated by the different color these are really nice gummy very high qualities of very high quality full spectrum oil and they are also quality infused so you have very consistent flavoring taste and CBD oil quantity in between each one of these gummies and again like I said you can get them available in the four different flavors yeah so like we said these will actually be below the point three legal limit for according to the the hemp farm bill passed in 2018 so these are in accordance with that however they might have little traces of THC within the legal hemp limits but they're there is that there is that so people who don't want to roll the dice to get you know drug tested and things like that then generally you want to stick with the isolate based product because there is zero THC in there whatsoever those could be within the legal limits see would be fine and it's still very very small almost non-traceable but we do have to put that out there for you guys then there's also gummies that we're developing that are almost like gushers to where there are very soft and heavily infused with flavor so it's kind of like they melt in your mouth and then they have the the the flavor follows up afterwards and rolls them so it's different from kind of a chewable gummy this is this is an extremely soft chew if we could even classify that but I would say it to a gusher and we have them infused I just want to go ahead and show these because some companies I've seen are doing it we're gonna start offering it but we have not yet so these are in the shape of bear but they're extremely soft very fluffy and almost melts I even feel bad putting them putting them out here but they are and they are actually they're full-spectrum and they're infused we have some of these samples are 25 milligrams all the way down to 10 but you can see that these are more than fusion style soft to customized gummies tour these these gummy bases are actually custom made to really melt so these ones are gonna be more like a gusher and generally you can tell from how fluffy and how soft they look and if you get a real good close-up there you can you can see the difference between that and even a fluffy standard gummy you know so again those would be full-spectrum and infused and then for those people who are looking for positive hemp benefits possibly a multivitamin I've also seen we don't currently offer them but hemp will extract gummy chews that you can see here these actually have hemp oil they're CBD content isn't really confirmed but it does have 20 milligrams of a hemp extract and it's also infused with like a multivitamin tour it has like your vaults a mitten or a vitamin b-complex and also your vitamin C's and different vitamin E so if you're just looking for like a nutritional supplement and don't necessarily want CBD we don't offer it but these are starting to get really popular within the hemp community and something you probably will come across most of these because they also have the multivitamin they're not going to be coated they're gonna be infused so they are gonna be very consistent to take on a daily basis you won't each one is gonna be very consistent to the other and again sometimes with the coated stuff some of them might be a little bit strong and others but generally averaged out pretty good so in summary I hope that today's

premium hemp gummies in the serene orchard flavors but before we do make sure you like and subscribe to this channel the joy organics premium hemp serene orchard gummies contain 20 milligrams of a broad spectrum CBD product that is organically grown right here in the US another really great thing about these gummies is that they are naturally flavored and sweet so there are no artificial flavorings or sweetening now joy organics was founded by a grandmother joy who had trouble sleeping and she had some residual pain in her shoulder so the conventional methods she tried everything she tried didn't work and that is when she went to work trying to develop a product that one stuck to her wellness and natural minded proclivities but also really really worked so you will find a really large variety of products inside the joy organics website they have these gummies they have tinctures they have nano emulsified technology products in there soft gels they contain a huge variety of products that are all broad-spectrum that means they go through great lengths to keep the cannabinoid profile of the industrial hemp plant in place they just remove the THC they do use co2 extraction to get the cannabinoids out of the hemp plant but it is all organically grown and it's right here in the US so what exactly are the joy organics serene orchard gummies these are super super simple gummies in fact there are only eight ingredients the first three of which are apple juice agave and stevia so it's a very simple natural product that is a great way for you to get your CBD supplement in in a controlled and can way each of the gummies there are 15 in this container come in a little bitty plastic bottle that fits basically on the palm of your hand it is really convenient I love it because you can just toss it in your bag and go it's really convenient and each gummy again contains about 20 milligrams of CBD now the thing that you do want to keep in mind is when you eat the CBD when you ingest it like with these gummies it might take a little bit more time for you to receive the benefits of the product so compared to like a vape which is almost instantaneous or an oil which is within a few minutes when you utilize a gummy or an edible it could take a half an hour to an hour to really see the benefits of this product now let's talk a little bit more about what's in this bottle when you order it you will get in this little clear container and it will have a little seal on top of it you do get 15 milligrams of CBD and on the bottom of the bottle you will see some numbers right here at the bottom of this little container if you take your phone and scan the QR code or if you are on the joy organics website they will actually have a link to the test results which is where this QR code takes you you will be able to find everything you need to know about what is actually inside these gummies another cool thing about the joy organics website is right on the main product page they have a summary of the test results and then if you scroll down underneath the facts there is a direct link to their trust results which is where you can type in this number right now joy organics does only ship to the US they have three retail operations and they offer wholesale opportunity so you could get it in a local CBD shop near you possibly let's talk just a moment about the test results so one thing that is really cool that I thought about the test results is that it prefers the different levels of the different cannabinoids and terpenoids did positive for CVG CBC and CBN and although the science or some the science but the study perhaps of the cannabinoids specifically cbgc B and C BC and even CBD are very very new the fact is preliminary evidence suggests that each of these cannabinoids are very beneficial to our body and so I loved the fact that this wasn't just a CBD isolate this actually had different cannabinoids with the idea being that the different cannabinoids all in your system all together will actually help to enhance the overall effect of the supplement so you can find all of that again on the analysis which you can locate easily by scanning the QR code or going to the product page but guess what we've made it even easier if you check out the written review located at Green Valley nation.com we actually have a copy of the test results for this lot so you don't even have to go anywhere else you just click on that link right below this video but before you do make sure you subscribe to this channel so let's talk just a second about what it's like to actually supplement with the Joye organics gummies so when you get it again it is sealed and they are not exactly like gummy bears like you may remember as a child they're their little round almost ambery brown colors that kind of stick together most of mine actually did stick together the very first time I took these I wasn't really paying attention I was on my way out the door and it was gonna be a busy day I had already forgotten my CBD so I just kind of grabbed these and then throw them in the bag while first of all tossing one into my mouth I'm not going to lie it was not the most pleasant experience the first time I it actually gave me pause because I thought oh but I don't love stevia or agave much to my father's chagrin like I really don't like the flavor of either of those sweeteners although I know they are much better for you so keep in mind if you do use this product you will definitely taste the agave and the stevia the thing that I absolutely loved about it was about half an hour 45 minutes later I woke enough with the hip pain it was gone and I had to go teach a yoga class within 45 minutes and I was a little bit worried that morning because my was hurting but I was able to teach that entire class pain free because of these gummies and it lasted me through lunch a little bit you know about nap time for my kids so I really loved the fact that it lasted all day I have been able to take these for the last couple of weeks do you know just as I needed for pain or whatever and every single time I have taken them it has reduced or eliminated all of the pain that I had specifically in my hip in my low back so I really loved it however I have not gotten used to these gummies the stevia and the agave flavor they are strong so although apple juice is the main ingredient it's the first ingredient so there's the most apple juice in here out of all the other ingredients the fact is the stevia and the agave flavor it is strong so keep that in mind if you don't love that flavor the benefit of it is I don't taste any of the earthy flavors that's commonly found in even gummies or other CBD products so you know it's a it's a balance right so this is a supplement and it's used to help calm you down reduce anxiety maybe perhaps it can reduce pain so if you think about it more like this is my supplement it's like my protein shake I'm just gonna drink it it makes it a little bit easier they are easy to take because it is a good size and they go down relatively easy so let's talk about a few reasons why I think you should try this joy organics premium hemp serene orchard gummies first of all these puppies are convenient there are this plastic case it's small enough it can throw into your purse you can put it in your diaper bag you don't have to worry about it these are really convenient and they work within an hour easily you will notice the difference whether you're stressed out or there's pain you will definitely notice a difference now for those of you that are very very wellness or health conscious and you don't want any artificial sugars or even processed sugars this is another great option for you why because there's only eight ingredients the first three of which are apple juice agave and stevia like it really doesn't get much more basic than that these are vegan and forget they are made in a pharmaceutical grade compounding facility so that means that every single time you get a gummy it's gonna look the same it's gonna smell the same it's gonna taste the same and it's going to give you the exact same results so these are some really great reasons to use it the first and most probably the primary reason is the fact that this stuff works now let me talk to you about the things that you might want to consider when you're buying them the first one is if you do not like see if it stevia or agave you're gonna have a hard time with these because they are they taste like stevia and agave will just leave it like that so the flavor is definitely very strong but again it is a premium product that you know it's going to help you feel better the other thing you might want to keep in mind is these puppies are kind of expensive it is a premium product it is GMP certified so it's made in a really good facility but you're looking at about $3 or gummy which is kind of an investment considering the amount of CBD in each gummies so if you're on a budget these might not be the best idea for you because they are a little bit more expensive however you are getting some high quality CBD in these products it is all organic every single product inside this bottle is organic it has grown inside the US it is manufactured inside the US and so it is the quality control measures they cost something so if that's something that's very important to you the cost isn't going to bother you as much because it works and you know exactly what you're getting every single time you open this bottle so here are a few quick facts about the joy organics serene orchard gummies they come in 15 gummies per container they are broad-spectrum so that means you get the full cannabinoid profile of the hemp plant however they virtually eliminated the THC in fact it tests negative for THC in the test results they come in at about three dollars a gummy they are vegan they are manufactured in a GMP certified facility and they are all grown inside the US with a hundred percent organic hemp in fact this entire product is a hundred percent organic thank you so much for watching this review I hope you enjoyed it and maybe you learned something new and I'm really curious to know if you have tried these things and if the flavor was as strong to you I know everybody has kind of different flavor profile discretions but these had a really strong flavor however they worked like every single time I've taken one and I've given my husband one and I've given a couple of friends some they work inside of an hour the like if you're feeling super stressed which was me today like I just calmed down so these things work but they don't taste good so I'm just curious to know what you think of them

vacations for me I don't stress out like it's it's it's I think it's one of the best things I've ever tried for anxiety it's it's weird and I didn't even know I had anxiety until I started taking CBD I think these little jammies these are this is uh this will [ __ ] you up though this is one in one one part CB don't put this one but yeah it does not put this in your you can put in your butt but you will get no nervous you're gonna get paranoid but it's it's a weird like the CBD THC high is a different high because CBD does something to alleviate anxiety it sort of just leaks makes you comfortable with your own demise lets you do the existential angst is the flames don't seem so hot so you like yeah we're all gonna die yeah but right now we're not dead cool look at the colors let's feel that feel the warmth the Sun but this uh this is not like funk this is not functional like you don't wanna I don't do this if I have anything super important to do but but just CBD oil hmm I just find it it did puts you in a great place okay like it but I'm journal not topical its internal yeah topical is really good for muscle aches okay it's really good really the probably the best thing

ibuprofens terrible for you alright really really bad what I found out was that if you let your pets lick it they get liver failure and die so don't did you guys accidentally didn't know I had a person who works at the Humane Society I mentioned you know mentioned that I found this stuff and like I just in desperation and Europe like she had some storm muscles and uh she's like don't let your pets like that cuz they were trying to kind of figure why these kittens were dying Oh God my friend Cameron Haynes is a runner and he runs marathons and runs ultra marathons he runs he's 240-mile Moab [ __ ] ridiculous runs that last three days and he was having like all this joint pain so he's taking ibuprofen every day of st. taking 800 milligrams not just once but sometimes twice a day and he was just constant aches and pains so dr. Rhonda Patrick had been on the podcast she was talking about the dangers of ibuprofen and about what it does to your gut biome and how much it [ __ ] you up and it actually creates inflammation and actually can cause stress or it can cause strokes rather and all sorts of horrible horrible things so I call him up and I said hey man that stuff's fine to take every now and then for a headache but you can't take that [ __ ] every day you just can't do it and you're you're [ __ ] your body up just get off of it and I sent him the recording he listened to it he's like Jesus Christ I don't have a stroke so he gets off of it all his pain goes away it turned out his pain was being caused not just by the running but by the fact that he was creating inflammation by destroying his gut biome by taking 800 milligrams of ibuprofen 2 times a day so the idea of like fixing himself was [ __ ] him up crazy death chasing that yeah yeah so [ __ ] ibuprofen okay well we don't I take it every now and then but you can't take it every day so you're a liar no I mean just saying don't take it every day but if I had like a bad headache I'll take you some Tylenol or some [ __ ] it's not Tylenol right Advil yeah yeah it's it's it's just not something you're supposed to take all the time yeah I never realized it was doing what you said yes I was more achy than I should be and then like you know bad night out you didn't drink enough water right okay boom coming ahead yeah then you're fine you can still do that but CBD does that too it's better better for you than all that stuff seems to be no side effects okay all right the side effects is people think you're a hippie that's the only side effect right", "KAycqbqNaes": "[Music] thanks for coming back to my channel my name is Karen a and you

really good and they actually work great compared to like a lot of the other companies that I've tried CBD gummies and then this stuff to CBD peppermint oil it's super strong I'll take it if I'm having trouble going to sleep I'll take a dropper in it with about 20-30 minutes I'm feeling super chill super calm and I'm usually sleep in like 20-30 minutes how they recommend this stuff I also

in. Do like a really cool zoom,\nyou know what I mean? Like woo-oh-woo-oh-wooh-oh. Hey guys, thanks for tuning in. I'm Megan\nMitchell and I'm here in the Thrive Market Test Kitchen, and today I'm gonna\nshow you how to make homemade CBD or hemp gummies. They're really easy and\nthey're really yummy, and I can't wait to show you how to make them, and if you're\nwondering with Thrive Market is? It's an online market that sells non-gmo and\norganic produce straight to your door, and CBD! They have their own line of CBD\nhemp extract. So let me show you how easy this is to make. I'm using two different\nfruit juices; you can use whatever juice. You could do green juice; you could do\norange juice. I'm doing a citrusy turmeric, and I also did a strawberry\nlemonade; because those are the flavors I like. But you can play around with\nwhatever you like. I'm gonna demo with this beautiful color. Yeah who doesn't want to eat gummies. It look like this. I need one cup and this is still cold,\nit hasn't been sitting out too long. Wait you got to make sure it's exactly one\ncup; because I measured this out for my gummy mold so it might be different for\nyours, but mine took exactly - wait a minute there's something that's weird;\nso when I look on this side it says that it's one cup, but I'm when I look at this\nside it says its - I think it's just slanted a bit. Okay well one cup, and\nwhile it's still cold add three tablespoons of gelatin and whisk this\ntogether, and then we'll heat this up to dissolve the gelatin. So you always want\nto add gelatin to something that's cold; it'll start to solidify as you see, but I\nwant it nice and smooth so I'm gonna heat it up. Ohoohoo! One tablespoon of my favorite sweetener, maple syrup. You could do honey, you could do regular sugar;\nwhatever you like, you can see it's kind of thick, it's not so loose anymore.\nOkay I'm gonna pour this in a pot over at the stove, heat it up, and I'll show\nyou how quickly this comes together. Here we are I guess. I never know what to say when we come over here. I'm holding some gelatin - this feels\nweird. Here we are. Okay so you can see my\ngelatin is firmed up; totally fine, we're gonna heat it up and then pour it into\nour molds. So don't worry if it gets like super super hard, or super gelatinous - oh\nwell that's what it, yeah that's what happens. This is gelatin. Just scoop it\ninto your pot, and then we're gonna heat it up because you can see it's kind of uh,\nit's not super smooth. I want it smooth. I want my gummies to be just perfection.\nOkay bring this up to heat over like medium, you don't want it too high that\nyou're gonna burn it; because there is maple syrup in it. So this has already\nstarted to melt, and I want to cook it for a total of three to five minutes,\nbecause I really want to make sure everything has dissolved.\nThere's no clumps of gelatin, I want to let this cool slightly before I add the\nCBD. If you're wondering like, I thought you're making CBD gummies Meg, where's the CBD. So you don't want to add it to super hot liquid, and also what are the\nbenefits of CBD like why? What's the big hubbub? I heard people using it it can help with anxiety, it can help with exercise\ninduced inflammation. The bonus about using gelatin, and the CBD gelatin, is\ngreat for your joints. It's good for your belly, you have some stomach issues\nCBD also helps support an overall sense of calm. Which sometimes I need, you know what I mean. I got a camera in my face all day, there's\npeople yelling at me. I need some calm. Okay this has melted I'm gonna let it\ncool slightly and then I'll show you how this all comes together.\nI've just been pacing around the kitchen, cooling down my gelatin mixture. All\nright, same liquid measuring cup for the mixture right back in there. My molds\nthat I'm using, they're kind of big - which I'm into. Like you know I wanted dece\npiece whenI have a gummy bear - like I want it to be substantial. There are 34\nGummy's in this tray, and I'm doing two gummies per serving. So I need 17 drops\nof my CBD hemp extract - math I did it. mmm! I get really psyched when I do simple\nsimple math. So I'm gonna have two of these a day for my suggested serving; but\nkinda you have to do the math with whatever mold you get. Alright that's\nmy spiel about my gummy molds, and it comes with a handy dandy dropper. So this is just warm. Remember I don't want to add my CBD hemp extract to direct heat,\nlike when this is boiling or right on the heat, it might break it down, it might\nevaporate it. So I want to get full potency when I use this, so warm is okay.\nCold is okay. But you just don't want this to be super hot; alright seventeen\ndroppers, let's go: one, two... seventeen. Okay mix this together because you can see the hemp extracts sitting on the top, so just whisk whisk. Okay so I\nhave my gummy mold that I've lightly sprayed, and I have it on a sheet tray\nbecause it's a lot easier to put in the fridge than just like this. So put it on\na small sheet tray. Mine comes with a dropper, and we're just gonna fill these\nguys; and be careful with a spillage over the sides, because then your gummy bears will have a little weird...like capes on them. So fill them to the top, but don't\noverfill them. Fill, fill, fill. Remember I did the turmeric citrus one, but for my\nstrawberry and lemonade it's the same exact process. It's one cup, three\ntablespoons, seventeen drops. 8-6-7-5-309. Her name is Jenny, give her a call. She's\nmaking CBD gummies. I'm just gonna top these off. Pop these in the\nfridge for 20 to 30 minutes until they firm up, and then you can pop them\nout. I'll show you, it's super easy. My gummies have firmed up for about 30\nminutes. Just gonna pop one out to show you how easy\nthey come out. See? They pop right out thanks to the spray before; because I\nactually made them one time without spraying the mold, and they were like...\nlike someone lost some nose, someone only had one ear, someones paw was a\nlittle broken. I was like, ooh. Gotta spray you guys. Keep them in a jar, a container\nwith a tight-fitting lid, and keep them in your fridge for 17 days and take two\na day, and yes you can take just the dropper once a day if you want. But I\nthink it's kind of fun to take a gummy, and maybe you don't like the flavor of\nthat, and you get the boost of gelatin. They're sweet, they're fruity, and\nremember this is my turmeric citrus. These are my strawberry lemonade. Okay,\nI'm gonna give this a try. Chewy like a gummy bear, but has that CBD hemp, lightly sweet. These are delicious. I might have a problem just eating two\na day. But two a day if you want to stick with\nthe suggested serving amount. I hope you give these a try and thank you for\nliking and commenting and subscribing. I do read your comments, so keep them PG I don't want my feelings hurt, but be nice. But you guys usually are, so thank you so\nmuch; and let me know if you make these, let me know if you use CBD hemp extract\nand you know happy gelatin gummy making. Thanks for watching. I'm about to bite your head off but you're gonna serve a purpose. I love you. CeeeBeeeDeee gummies - errday.  Can we not use that?", "xb0Abd51IEo": "hey what's up it's dustin and in this video i'm going to be doing a review on wild cbd gummies so i just wanted to show you uh the packaging um and it comes in a box and i've got this from a local dispensary here in oregon this product is created in oregon and they say that they use cbd concentrate derived from hemp that's made in the united states of america so that's cool they don't tell me exactly where the hemp comes from but they're an organ-based business and there's a lot of hemp in oregon so i'm guessing hopefully their cbd concentrate comes from oregon because that's uh the best place in the world to grow him anyway so here's their bottle and i'll just tell you right now i got the huckleberry flavor and it is uh 25 milligrams of cbd per gummy and i'll show you what the gummy looks like it's just a little rectangle here it's very sweet and to be honest it's extremely tasty i love the huckleberry flavor they also come in raspberry and there's a couple other flavors and this brand wild cbd they do gummies and they do sparkling water so it's interesting because they're in a space in the cbd world that isn't quite as common i mean gummies are very common um but they don't do the normal things like cbd tinctures or topicals or that kind of thing they they strictly are gummies and sparkling water so i really to be honest i really like the brand i looked up the coa of this product here and in addition to 25 milligrams of cbd per gummy and i believe that's the same serving size in their sparkling water as well 25 milligrams i looked and it is a full spectrum product full spectrum meaning it has a little bit of cbc in it and a little bit of cbn i didn't see any cbg and they call it a thc free product but it comes i don't think it's made with isolate i think it's actually made from a distillate of some sort an oil of some sort of concentrate of some sort so they have been able to remove the thc from that and uh they're left with with cbd gummy so anyway um a lot of different ingredients i'm not going to go into all of them it's a sweet product there's sugar obviously in it but anyway if you're interested in something other than maybe a tincture or some other oral means of getting your cbd and you like the idea of gummies this makes it really easy for you this bottle right here comes with 20 gummies and it costs 34.99 i believe 35 for the 20 gummies so you're looking at about i don't know what is that nearly a dollar fifty per gummy so a dollar fifty per 25 milligrams of cbd so i don't think it's a horrible price uh if that's the way that you want to get your cbd obviously there's there's some cheaper ways of going about it but um they say on the bottle it takes 90 minutes to activate so if you're eating it and digesting it it's going into your stomach and through your system it actually does take a little bit more time for cbd to absorb into your system whereas with the tincture if it goes if it absorbs um using using the oil into your system it can activate a little bit faster so anyway all that to say wildcbd.com if you want to give them if you want to check them out i really recommend them i think it's a great product they're giving you the cbd they're really upfront transparent about their coas they're an organ-based business so i really like that and it's a it's a tasty product it's a good way to get your cbd well thanks for watching the video if you want to buy any of our cbd products you can go to greenmethodfarms.com and be sure to use the promo code youtube and

up in the video [ __ ] where did i leave off at hey man it's mike from bonus cbd.com today we got uh hometown's new gummy bears man this is that delta eight thc pretty [ __ ] excited about this supposedly delta athc is supposed to be some strong [ __ ] it's supposed to knock you on your ass man i'm really curious if it's gonna taste the same as the other blueberry uh gummy bears they kind of had a sour taste to it it was pretty good man so i'm really curious about that so let's go ahead and start talking a little bit about delta athc supposedly what what everybody's saying is delta 18c is supposed to be more of a medical property thc more so than delta 9. delta 9 thc is the one that's regulated that's the one that you can't have above 0.3 percent you have that have to have it below now all the other tastes like delta delta eight thc a thcc all that can just be as high as they [ __ ] possibly can or as low as they possibly can either one there's no regulations on those guys it's just a delta nine thc that has the regulation but let's go ahead and crack this open and try these out now when we got these in they told us two get you feeling real good three you getting couch locked so i'm thinking about just trying out three i'm gonna try out these two and then go from there has no smell so we can't do a smell test let's try these gummies out man all right so let's go ahead and talk a little bit more about the thc's and the cbd properties that are inside these gummies um first off though the flavor it tastes just like the other blueberry gummies if you've ever had that if you haven't it's just a sour patch kid with the blueberry sour patch kid pretty much that's the easiest way to explain the flavor of that one now so one thing about this is it has like hardly any cbd properties in it it's point if you look at the lab results it's going to say 0.01 percent they round it down to zero that's why you can see on the side of this package it says zero milligrams of cbd there's not enough cbd in it for them to say hey these are cbd gummies that's just kind of false advertising now it's only pretty much only delta 8 thc and that's supposed to be good for medical use now as far as recreational side goes we're still waiting on that to kick in so we're gonna go ahead and give it 30 minutes and then we're gonna come right back and i'm gonna tell you how i'm feeling off these delta a cbds tell you how good they are how bad they are so stay tuned i'll be right back man all right man we're back after waiting 30 minutes for these to uh kick in i do feel a little something off of it more so than what i was expecting i wasn't expecting a whole lot so let's go ahead and talk about how it made me feel imagine taking like one or two beers that's about the same amount of feels that you get off of this i can see why it's good for some people and i can see why it's not good for others a lot of people are like oh delta eight that sounds spicy it's new it's not bad i don't mind it at all one thing i like about this is there's like no thc in it so if anybody needs to take it and you don't need thc in your system yeah you'll be all right man now if you're wanting a little bit more of a kick there might be something else stronger i want to say actually i have more of a feeling off the cbd gummies versus the delta 8 gummies that one gave me a harder feeling quicker this one's giving me more of a deep feeling i don't know if that makes sense i don't know how to explain it other than that but that's what i get off of this so it's pretty good i like it like i was saying though earlier the flavor is going to be a lot like a sour patch kid so that's always nice it doesn't have that dirty hemp [ __ ] dirt taste nobody wants that [ __ ] all right so if you're curious man first off i didn't tell you all to stay tuned for the promo code so stay tuned for the promo code y'all are about to get that let's talk about the price point of this guy real quick so the other gummies they're 25 bucks this one's 30. i can actually get behind that price point i did say you do feel a little bit more off the other gummies quicker and i was saying that this one's a little deeper but man you do feel a little bit better off of this one than the gummies five dollars more makes sense i'm cool with that doesn't hurt my feelings now so let's get let's hit you with that promo code let's keep the promo code simple this time we're just gonna hit you with delta eight that's gonna be the promo code it's not going to be the [ __ ] numeric roman [ __ ] delta with the triangle and [ __ ] [ __ ] illuminati [ __ ] okay it's just going to be delta all right man so that's that's going to be it for this video i'd like these gummies they're pretty good so yeah man y'all have a good one we'll we'll see y'all next time peace so quick update video on those gummies uh because it didn't really start hitting me until after i went home those things are bad ass man uh yeah there's he was not joking when he said three will knock you in the couch because i only took two and i would say maybe about 30 minutes hour after i left after we shot the video is when it really kicked in uh yeah they're strong delta a no there's no need for the cbd in it man the delta a if you're wanting something recreational and uh not illegal this this shit's good this shit's good so definitely try it out man all right y'all have a good one hey man be sure to check out our two videos down at the bottom and uh if you like our [ __ ] and [ __ ] support us man uh like comment share

isolate broad spectrum as well as full spectrum we will talk about the advantages and disadvantage of each one of them and why you may want to prefer one over the other so stay tuned and let's just jump right into it [Music] hello again and if you're new here welcome if you're not welcome back i am dr jack and i've been doing this entire video series on the details of cbd and if you want to learn more about it i will put a link down below in the description so that you can go and there's a particular order i suggest watching all these videos so that they make a little bit more sense but feel free to check those out like and share them if you find them helpful but for today's purpose this video will be concentrating on the differences between cbd isolate cbd broad spectrum as well as full spectrum if you're anything like me when i first walked into a store and started learning about cbd or went online and started doing the research i was a little bit blown away by all of the choices and didn't really know where to start so i hope this video will help clarify some of the confusion and make you a more informed consumer so that you can tap into the benefits and the benefits of this amazing plant so one of the things we should first talk about is cbd in general or better known as cannabidiol it is one endocannabinoid or one cannabinoid rather amongst a myriad of over 140 different cannabinoids within the cannabis plant so there are other ones like cbn cbg there's also thc which is what is known for its popularity within marijuana and that's what gets people the euphoric effect and gets them high that is the complete opposite of cbd which is federally legal since the farm bill was redone in 2018 and is as long as it has less than 0.3 percent thc it does not cause a high and actually it is the anti-marijuana or anti-thc because it actually decreases the high if somebody is using marijuana along with a cbd dominant product it's been shown to be very safe in moderate dosages and as well as effective for like sleep mood pain and all sorts of things and i see this as well in my pain practice and this is actually what got me started as far as my interest within the plant and the plant works with your body's own cannabinoid system it's called the endocannabinoid system and it is a system that kind of crosstalks between every other major every other major system within your body and provides a homeostasis and this is a very broad kind of generalization of everything that i'm talking about here if you want to know more again i'll link it down below of all the other videos if you want to take a deeper dive to kind of understand it but that's not really the purpose of this video [Music] so let's break down what the cannabis plant is and so in the world of cannabis you have cannabis and then you have marijuana which again is the thc dominant plant that gives you the high that is federally illegal but it is legal in some states even for recreational usage and then if you go down the other path you have hemp and hemp is defined by the federal government and it's legal as long as it is below 0.3 percent thc and this is where the bulk of cbd especially in states where marijuana is not legal that it is basically extracted from it has been again shown to be safe and does not cause a high within the plant you also have lots of other phytonutrients or plant nutrients and these are things like terpenes and flavonoids as well as again the other cannabinoids within there and so terpenes is what gives fruits vegetables spices things like that it's aroma that's mainly what aromatherapy essential oils is based around and they have their own health implications that is well documented as well as flavonoids which are what gives basically fruits and vegetables its color and there are specific ones that are found within the cannabis plant such as canned flavon a and b these two flavonoids specifically to the cannabis plant have been found to have 30 times that's 3-0 the anti-inflammatory effects of aspirin and it's important to understand all of this because of the fact that when you talk about cbd isolate broad or full spectrum it starts breaking down all these different products and so let's go ahead and start by talking about cbd isolate so cbd isolate as the name is described is just pure cbd it's about 99 cbd and this is the kind of basis of actually drugs are approved by the fda such as epidiolex which is a seizure anti-seizure medication that's approved by them what the advantages of the cbd isolate are that it is tasteless and odorless so some people don't like the taste of the cannabis plant as well as there's no risk of euphoria or getting a high because there is no thc within it this is assuming again that you're buying a very high quality product that is safely lab tested and processed accordingly and again to learn more about that please refer to previous videos the disadvantage of the cbd isolate is that it has a very narrow therapeutic window and what that means is that you seem to have to take more of it to get a desired effect and the reason for that is because of the fact that it does not take advantage of what's known as the entourage effect and that means that the plant is more effective as a whole than the sum of its parts and the entourage effect means that all those phytonutrients that i talked about earlier such as the terpenes the flavonoids and all the other cannabinoids within the plant they all work with each other to create a synergistic effect to help you with health and wellness and that is what's lacking from the cbd isolate and so who's the cbd isolate good for well if you're new to cannabis and want to try cbd and you want to stay away from thc or if you're someone who's very sensitive to 2h to thc or if your state laws do not allow for any thc at all then this might be something to consider so next what about broad spectrum so you have isolate and the next step up is broad spectrum the broad spectrum means that it has everything that the cannabis plant has to offer but again minus the thc so there is cbd in it but there's also the other cannabinoids as well as terpenes and flavonoids and other minerals and things like that that are present and so the broad spectrum does begin to take advantage of the entourage effect the disadvantage is that that little bit of thc that 0.3 thc that you know is missing and therefore it doesn't really maximize the um advantage of the entourage effect within this amazing plant and so who is it mainly for kind of the same thing as cbd isolate if you're someone that's new to it or if you're sensitive to thc and just really don't want to mess with the thc but still want the maximum benefit of the entourage sorry not the maximum benefit but still want the benefit of the entourage effect then this is the spectrum or classification of cbd that you may want to consider [Music] next is full spectrum the advantage of the full spectrum is that it takes advantage of the entourage effects to its maximum and because this does have that little bit of federally legal thc amount and that's at point three percent now please know that if you live in a state where recreational marijuana or medicinal marijuana is legal and there are state license dispensaries and things like that that those variations can uh be very variable and so please uh you know speak to whoever you're purchasing it from and get the details of this because in my state of north carolina currently only cbd derived from hemp is legal therefore 0.3 percent thc is the maximum amount that is currently allowed the advantage of the full spectrum is that it has the widest therapeutic window and therefore you take an advantage of the entourage effect as much as possible the downsides are that it is not odorless or tasteless and therefore it does kind of provide that odor and taste of the cannabis plant and some people don't like that however companies do put flavorings and things like that within the plant to make that more tolerable who is it for well it's for people that do not worry about getting drug tested at work and it is for people that are not sensitive to any little bit of thc as well as people that want the best shot of letting this plant offer them the maximum benefit and again that's due to the entourage effect [Music] and that basically summarizes this video as a very short video as opposed to my other videos and uh you know i hope you learned a lot about this and i hope that it makes a little bit more sense when you go out and start considering this amazing plant for your health and wellness if you have any questions or have any comments please put them down below in the comments section i love reading them and i'm very good about responding and stay tuned for other videos that will be coming out in regards to the cbd or a cannabis plant and i'll also be doing other videos that will be based on generally health and wellness if you like what you saw here please don't be afraid to share the video and please like and subscribe if you like the video it really helps

splatoon too but that's not what we're here about we're not here to talk about splatoon - as fun as the game may be we're here to talk about marijuana edibles welcome to wheats guys the marijuana edible review show the one where we help you make sense of your dispensary and it's late at night and I'm ready for bed but I can't go to sleep so that's why I've got my cushy punch hundred milligrams here indica variety right here you know Ben so I'm hoping this is going to do the trick this is the second time of reviewed cushy punch I reviewed their TKO formula before 200 milligrams and found it to be pretty disappointing to be honest it did not do much for me since that time I have had several several people come up to me and say and I come up to me I mean comment online that's what I mean by that I've had simple people comment to me online saying give Chris you budget another chance sometimes that their formulation isn't as strong as others but when it hits it really hits so I decided to give it another chance and this seems to be the perfect opportunity when you're ready for some sleep with the indica variety so let's go ahead and open it up give it a taste and I'll come back to you guys in just about two hours after this and hopefully be ready for bedtime so let's find out if that's going to be the case or not okay so we've got our little jar here it looks like a little butter Pat actually a little pad of butter that you would get at our restaurant it's a hundred milligrams of THC in here I said before so let's go ahead and open her up and slope her to him and hopefully get ready for bed in the there we go there's our corner and there she has one big gummy pop her out for little rivulets they're not gonna care just gonna plump the whole thing I'm not it's not super great it's better than the like confused creations or those kind of edibles I've done as good as the flourish it sort of tastes more like a flourish type edible than the infused creations or at a pure or any of those two so it's better than those but it's not as good as the flourish company's in terms of taste so from here guys I'm just going to wait it out and hopefully in two hours I'll be ready for bed so I will see you guys then I'll see you guys in two hours to let you know how we're feeling because that's the way the wheats reviews work for you it's just going to be a couple of seconds so I'll see you on the other side of the break and for me it'll be two hours and I'll let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching weeds guys and I'll see you soon peace mission accomplished I think and a slight redemption for cushy punch I am ready to go to bed quite sleepy at this point looking forward to hitting that pillow and I feel pleasantly buzzed for one hundred and milligram edible this cost me eight dollars at my dispensary all-in with all the discounts so you know pretty affordable 400 milligram edible and I do feel about about a six maybe five and a half or so so you know I'm not super super high by any means but you know definitely high noticeably high and ready to hit the sack so I'm ready to give cushy punch another chance try another one there edibles because they earned their Redemption with this one I just there 200 milligram did not see you know any stronger than this for sure maybe it's just as people have told me their potency seems to fluctuate up and down so maybe this was just a stronger batch but we'll review some more could you punch in a few to see if my opinion changes but for now this was a pleasant surprise and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheat skies and we will check you out on a future review peace", "sMW-PFryndU": "a CVT friends I'm back to do another video teaching on CBD hemp oil and today I'm going to be explaining the difference between CBD and hemp and I'm going to give you a really simplified explanation initially and then I'm going to go to in a little bit more detail for those of you who want more detail if you're new to my channel I'm Katherine certified nutrition consultant founder of foods that heal you and foods that heal you CBD and below in the description below this video I will have links to my websites and where you can buy CBD oil and all that good stuff alright so let's go ahead and get started with the basic explanation between the difference between hemp and CBD so the hemp plant has CBD in it so they're not really separate they are actually the same thing because the hemp has CBD in it it's like the Apple has vitamin C in it right so you can't really compare an apple to vitamin C because the vitamin C's in the Apple well CBD is actually in the hemp plant Solo's let's go ahead and break this down a little bit farther so you've got the hemp plant which is a cannabis so the umbrella is a cannabis alright and the cannabis plant has the hemp species and the marijuana species what we're going to talk about is the hemp species from the hip species plant you've got hemp seeds and so I'm going to show you what hemp seeds are these are hemp seeds they don't have any CBD in them so the seeds don't have any CBD in them what they do have are a ton of nutrients they're a great source of plant protein for those of you who don't want to have to eat a lot of animal foods you rather get your protein from the plant this is a terrific source there's B vitamins iron there's a ton of nutrients omega-3 fats that are really essential for health so Hennessey's are really healthy but they don't have CBD in them alright but what they do have in them is all those nutrients and that's where you get hemp oil so this is actually avocados I don't have any but health oil is typically going to come in a bottle like this you can get it at grocery stores you can get health food stores Amazon whatever but it's typically going to come in a normal bottle be like ten dollars or something all right so that's that's the seed part of the plant and then you know the flowers in the stock and the rest of the plant and that's where you're going to find the cannabinoids which have the CBD so for example you've got the flower and the stalk in the flower and the stock you're going to cannabinoids and if you've been on my channel for a while you've probably seen me hold up this chart here or wheel and this is the CBD wheel that shows you several cannabinoids CBD is one of them CVCC BG THC there's over a hundred cannabinoids alright so in the flowering spec you have cannabinoids you also have naturally-occurring plant terpenes and other plant parts one of those cannabinoids like we mentioned in this wheel is CBD so you can see the Cascade here where the CBD is coming from if you get a full spectrum CBD hemp oil product you're going to have all of if it's true full spectrum now there's a lot on the market that are broad-spectrum those have some of these but not all of them it's not true full spectrum alright true full spectrum is going to all of them including trace amounts of THC now the amount of th she's not going to be enough to to feel or experience any effects from it and it's legal if it's below 0.3% which all of our products are going to be legal on below point 3 percent so you're not gonna feel anything but a true full spectrum will have that THC in there and some examples of true full-spectrum would be our tasty jobs here's the berry and the spearmint so these are full-spectrum and they're actually raw so you're gonna see like on our label CBD CBD a because CBD a is only in the raw version but it is a cam annoyed that gets converted to CBD when it's decarboxylated or heated so decarboxylated just a fancy term for heated alright so that's sample of full spectrum so it's gonna have the plant terpenes the plant parts all these fatty acids that are naturally occurring all of the cannabinoids everything okay so if I were to pick up a bottle like this and see hemp oil on the label which ours actually we use MCT oil but if it said hemp oil that's actually not what the CBDs coming from it's coming from the flowers of the stock so you want to make sure your labels gonna say on there CBD or phyto cannabinoids or hemp extract hemp extract is not hemp oil and extract is going to have the CBD in it so it can get really convoluted and confusing I do have a video training series you can check out my website sign up for that I have like eight videos and one of them explains how to read the labels because it can be so confusing alright another example would be our gold label this is a pure oil hemp oil oops sorry pure an oil extract it's gonna say final cannabinoids on here it's gonna say hemp extract and has the hemp CBD it has that cannabinoid and all of the cannabinoids it is full-spectrum it's gonna have trace amounts of the THC so if you don't want THC if you are for example you're worried about drug testing there are other options we have a broad spectrum we have our fav so there are other options that can be very effective but if you're looking for full spectrum and you want all those plant turkeys and you want all of the phyto cannabinoids and you want CB g and CB c or whatever you want a true full spectrum in fact our tasty drops do have people asking about CB g and CB c if you look at our lab results we there are trace amounts of those candids in there too which brings up another topic which i want to go too far into but people are starting to ask me what about CB g or CB c those are going to be isolates and some come from aged THC comforts into certain cannabinoids or the raw version has certain cannabinoids what I usually recommend to start out with a full spectrum and if you want more of one of those the CBC or the CB g or cbn for good then add that to it because you're going to want that entourage effect your one gonna want that effect we're in synergistic everything in nature nutrients all work together you want the whole Apple not just the vitamin C when you eat the whole Apple and then take maybe extra vitamin C you're getting way more health benefits it's going to be much more effective so if you want maximum results I recommend a full spectrum first and then adding in these other specific handle rights that you are looking for now CVD a is a different kind of different because it's naturally occurring in the raw fall spectrum so at full spectrum so you don't need to supplement with just CBD a you just want to get our tasty drops or our blue label is pretty high in CBD a also so if you're looking for that okay so I think that covers it I'm going to make this pretty simple and kind of sure because I know for me when I'm watching YouTube I like just get to the point I don't hear all this other stuff so hopefully that gave you a really good overview and a little bit of detail in there and if there's videos specifically that you would like me to do videos on make a comment below below in the comment section please be nice usually people are pretty nice but anyway so thanks for watching this video you can check out my website foods that heal you CBD calm to learn more and click like if you liked this you know all of that good stuff

time you stopped by and for the rest of you guys welcome back and thank you so much for joining and first of all I would like to thank these people have donated to my patreon account thank you thank you very much means the world to me and your support with and your support for my channel thank you thank you so today what I'm going to bring to you quite a few quite a few people have asked for this recipe wasn't 100% sure if I could do it but that would be the old magic me I was able to pull this out so what we are going to make is a soda pop candy gummies and I'm gonna be making this with can of sugar and can of syrup I'm recipes for those links for those videos I cut down in the description for you and check these that I made these ones 7up and they look so cool of course I threw my two-tone as always check that out these are fun to makes a little bit different than the other recipes that we've done so just another way of doing things so you can use any pop at all rip your cherry coke whatever floats your boat you can go with I'm just happen to pick the 7up and yeah that's everything and they actually taste like seven real some enough whoo so I hope you join me for this whole thing stick around to the end because I do have some troubleshooting tips for you for anybody who is having problems with sticking to the molds and not coming out properly or having problems with them the sugar citric acid melting I do cover how to fix those and why those are probably happening alright so do stay to the end thanks for joining me let's jump right into those ingredients what we need and let me show you how these puppies are made all right so you ready for this so the ingredients we're going to need is one cup of a flattened pop and many many pop we'll do a yes I'm Canadian we say pop American I know soda whatever yeah I watch a ton of the competition baking shows of chocolate shows in Canada and they all use gelatin sheets and I'm like Oh Pesce said these gelatin sheets if the pros use it it must be good so what I found out is where I live they're very hard to come by I was actually only able to find them in to store the Russians store in an Italian the store and but in on on Amazon for the state you guys can get any type of gelatin sheets there are now these come in different grades it's bronze silver gold platinum and each of those are different strengths bronze is really weak silver is what they mainly use for mooses and and those wobbly things I don't know I can't think of it right now they use the silver which is about a 170 gel the gold or the platinum are going to be much strength stronger strength unfortunately I can't test with them so I don't know exactly how well they work I would love to be able to but they're on the unavailable we can only get silver in Canada yes so enough with the sheets so if you are going to try the gelatin sheets and the reason why this is so much better is makes your gelatin much softer so instead of having that really rubbery rubbery gelatin this is a much softer type of gummy candy if you use the sheets but you do need to use them in combination with granulated sugar but up I know that was a lot of talking on gelatin she so let's sleep just back up and start again one cup of your favorite flattened soda for gelatin sheets if you're going to use that if not one tablespoon or one package of the knocks gelatin that's for our soda side then we're going to do a coke candy syrup you're going to need a half a cup of can of sugar the link for the recipe how to make kin of sugar from tincture I will put in the description 1/2 a cup of regular sugar 1/4 cup of Canas can of syrup again link will be in the then you know where and 1/4 cup of your flat new soda as well we're going to cook that with our candy syrup so this is really going to help with giving us a more intense flavor in 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid 2 tablespoons or 2 packages of gelatin so yes 3 altogether if you're using the granulated for gelatin sheets in 2 tablespoons of unflavored gelatin if you're going with the sheets because I am using 7up and as a lemon-lime I can add a little dash of lemon and lime flavoring to enhance that a little bit because it does get a little muddled down however you can keep that playing that is totally optional that's pretty much it for our ingredients now a little quick tip here for your soda if you want to flatten it quickly pour it into a glass take a metal spoon and you just stir it for a few minutes minutes and then just let it sit for about 10 minutes with the spoon in it it will completely flatten your pop or you just pour it out let it sit out for a couple of hours and nature will take care of its own thing so let's get into the equipment that we need and let's get these made I know it's a lot of good alright so the equipment we need is a 2 small saucepan candy thermometer digital or the regular regular candy thermometer of course your molds now a tip for your molds is to put them in the freezer before you start making this circle now or so before it helps especially if you're doing two-tone colors then it'll it'll start to solidify immediately it's you poor it is it will kind of keep your colors separate instead of them bleeding together if you're just doing one color don't worry about it a couple small strainers that's if you have bubble issues a couple of spatulas a bowl of ice water if you are doing the gelatin sheets your bottles dispensing bottles or the funnel works really good what I found is using the funnel if I'm using one color is all the bubbles come up to the top and the stuff comes out the bottom so you get a much clearer serum pour into your molds versus this all the bubbles set up here we turn it upside down all the bubbles are coming out with it so this does give you a cleaner more a cleaner pour if you are having bubble issues um small bowl for blooming your unflavored gelatin non stick cooking spray for our syrup and parchment paper and our rock and that's about everything we need I believe as you know I usually always forget something but let's jump right in let's get these may need all right very first step you want to do is to pour your soda your flat soda into a small saucepan we're going to put that on to medium-high heat and we're going to reduce it to half a cup and the reason that we're going to do that is is going to help to concentrate our flavor more all right so get that started because it takes about 15-20 minutes to reduce it to half so we'll start that off and we'll get that going and then we're also going to start blooming our gelatin now if you are using gelatin sheets you need ice water you have to have ice water in order for these to blue so you just take your gelatin sheets they're just they're kind of cool they're like quick like crystal clear if they didn't have that lines in them you never find them coke just pop them you just ride them into the water if you guys just make sure that there's all submersed and you can set that off to the side okay so for our granulated gelatin you're going to take a third of a cup of cold flat and soda and it has to be cold pouring that into our ball and you're going to sprinkle your gelatin over the top and you're going to stir that into the liquid make sure that it's all mixed in and that there are no lumps now one thing that you guys talk about is sometimes your gummies are too soft a lot depends on your gelatin not all gelatin are created equal even if you buy an ox gelatin regularly even that can be different from time to time whether it's been exposed to excessive heat or cold can affect its gelatin strength as well as how long it's been stored how well it's been stored all those types of things factored into the gelatin and how it can affect its gelling strength so as I said sometimes you got an increase or a decrease a tablespoon or half a tablespoon teaspoon depending so you just kind of work on your recipe if they're coming out way too sticky you can't get them out of the molds increase your gelatin by about a half a tablespoon should take care of that but for this recipe I mixed together now my third of a cup and 2 tablespoons I'm gonna set that aside and then I'm just gonna wait for this first or a soda to reduce down to 1/2 so allow your your pot to cook down like so to boil down like so like I said to about 1/2 a cup and then periodically on because you can't really see what 1/2 a cup is is just keep another keep a measuring cup nearby and just take it pour it in and you can see where you're at so we've only done about cooked off about 1/3 of a cup so far I've got little ways to go but it takes about 15-20 minutes to do that alright once you've got it cook down to half a cup just put it back in pot and you can either set it to the side to cool down we want this to get to warm or you can plop it into the fridge for a minute or two a couple of minutes five minutes to cool it down like I said though we still wanted a little bit warm for our gelatin sheet okay so now for our cooked candy syrup side we are going to get oh I always forget this you want to spray your soft pan that we are going to do our coke candy syrup take your cooking spray a light coating of spraying all through your pot take a paper towel and take out the extra the excess we just want to have a nice thin layer of the nonstick coating on the side and the reason we're doing that is when you mix the can of sugar THC does not like water it's okay with sugar but I don't like water so much so it tries to run away it hides up the sides of the pot if you don't put that oil on this side your ITD's gonna get stuck there this way we're going to be able to get it off easily and get it back into the syrup glitter belongs so we take our cup of sugar or half a cup of candy sugar half a teaspoon of citric acid citric acid is to prevent sugar crystallizing and a quarter cup of our can of syrup she goes in our quarter cup of flattened soda we're gonna mix those together and then we are going to turn our heat on to medium high or just about number seven is good and we just get that mixed together the liquid and sugar all combined and you're going to continue stirring this until it begins to boil all right so register and make sure to use the side of your spatula to scrape any excess sugar crystals off the side or at first here with the first time you can use a pastry brush and hot water to wash down the sides but we're not going to use this afterwards so as we stir this their sugars are melting and our staring helps assist with that but once it starts boiling you don't want to stir it because that will cause excess asportation which can cause your sugar to crystallize and what that means is the sugar will reform itself and create crystals in your gummy candies over a couple of days and you don't want that that's really picky you want a cool down my by 7up portion of it in the fridge and I'm gonna take my gelatin sheets and what you do is take them out of the ice water and squeeze off the excess water from them it's really really good and then you just plop them right into your soda pop there and just mix them in and it just disappears God it sounds really cool and that's it just leave that off to the side until we're ready to it until we need that now my syrup is beginning to boil so at this point I am NOT gonna stir it anymore but what I am gonna do is continue to scrape the sides to keep them clear of our good stuff and what you'll see here if you get a lot of icky stuff on top that's just the impurities and stuff boiling off so don't worry about that that will all boil off very very quickly just try to keep that a key part into the middle there so it just cooks off and doesn't stick to the sides of your pot let's see how it just disappears said if you start to see any of it gathering on the side you just want to very gently go on with your spatula around the sides you want to try and do very little agitation and just gently squeeze it and bring that back into the middle then you can just dip your spatula in to melt off anything there and we are going to cook our syrup to 260 degrees so I'm just gonna take a look where we're at right now oh and the ice water that you used for your syrup you can keep that handy because we're gonna use that to stop our cooking our cooking syrup process so right now that I'm about to 47 so about another minute or two once you get past to 21 it goes very quickly again just as it's been he gathers on the side pull it in we're just melted off the spatula we're now at 253 so it's gonna go pretty quick from here so I'm going to keep my thermometer in 60 take it off your heat put it into your ice water turn off your heat and let this come down to about 220 we'll just leave it in the ice water it'll come down pretty quick and I'm gonna grab my gelatin okay now that our shower temperatures come down oh yeah it's come lay down we're good we are going to first add in our 7up or our soda and our gelatin side we're going to mix that in together and if you do find that it is starting to solidify on the bottom that it's getting a little too thick on the bottom just put it back on your burner there's still enough heat should be enough heat from there to melt that if not just put it on the lowest heat so you just want to get that syrup melted we don't want to heat it up again but nice nobody stick it in the corners and we got nothing on our sides which is perfect now we will take our unflavored gelatin and you want to cut it up into smaller pieces just helps with melting quicker lock them in now that's warming up there to melt your gelatin it should hopefully not be too warm to cause it to to break so just let that sit for a couple of minutes for about a minute or two and then we will stir it in and then you're just gonna gently stir to continue melting your gelatin now see this is what happens when you don't mix your gelatin properly in the beginning you get little little lumps here that happens if they don't melt in don't worry we're gonna strain that and then we'll get them out now the work we're basically done with our syrup so ready to cast now give it a little taste and if you find that it's lacking a little bit in its flavor and said if you're using like a 7up or sprite you can add you just want to do literally a drop you can either use this little supply a splash of real lemon or if you're using flavor oils use literally like a drop because you said you don't want to affect the natural flavor of the soda that you're using but sometimes it might get a little muddled like with the sprite or the 7up so literally that I use with just one drop just to enhance its flavor I don't want to mask it and trust me the line you do not want to use more than a drop its who uh he's very anemic keep joking now that that is mixed we're good to go I'm gonna get set up to pour oh so so if you're just doing one color you're good to go like me I always like to do the solid in the clear so well I'm gonna add a little bit I'm going to split this in half and I'm gonna add a little bit of white food colouring to half of the mixture and I'm gonna pour it with a strainer here so to catch any it to catch those lumps that didn't dissolve properly and if you want to be exact use a measuring cup but I just usually eyeball it so for the white if you're using white from the Wilton's one make sure to shake it very very well when you use it um if it sits for a little while it has a tendency to separate and yeah you don't want that to make sure to mix it really really well yeah we're just gonna add in a couple of drops I'm gonna give us a solid background a little bit more and with the white you do have to mix it really really well with the gelatin okay I'm just gonna get set up to get these casted alrighty so we're ready to get to the fun stuff now if you were using one of these funnels they don't come with the Unalaska canned they're a little hard to maneuver so what I created was an auto trigger well all I did was I removed the plastic singham sticky thing I tied not it it's a simple Slipknot elastic around the bottom slid it back through around the bottom now you have an auto an auto trigger which makes a lot easier for pouring so I just wanted to show you how this worked so I did support something that I'm just going to be clear I'm going to use it with this and the I'm gonna do teach own alright step top that huh so see what happens in the bottles like I said is the bubbles come up to the top well what you can do is get the spoon or spatula small enough and you can just kind of scoop those out I'm just gonna stick that there it's doing works better however I'm just gonna live with the bubbles right now because I don't really care that much now also with these bottles I've get larger tips I use four or five fours are good eyes are a little big they're good for a thicker syrup so well with our enough fun edge here I'm going to bring the camera because I want you to see how clear it actually comes out of the funnel alright so now it's time to take them out of the mold so gonna grab some parchment paper I don't know why I'm telling you that kind of calm pretty self-explanatory just didn't air and pop them out just like your regulars now give you some troubleshooting tips if you go to take your candies out of the mold and these stick so they're kind of like this and you can't get them off then let me show you so like that and you try and you can't get them off don't worry you can fix it pre-heat your oven to 200 degrees put your molds onto a cookie sheet and place them in the oven until they melt once they melt add them add the stick melted syrup to a small saucepan bloom a half a tablespoon to 1 tablespoon depending how sticky they are so if they're sticky they're almost want to come out but they just won't come out and then go with a half a tablespoon if they completely there just pretty much almost like tacky syrup then go with a tablespoon so if you're good at bloom excuse me so for half the tablespoon to bloom a half a tablespoon of gelatin you're going to use two tablespoons of cold liquid if you're going to use a tablespoon of gelatin you're going to go with a quarter cup of cold liquid sprinkle it on just like we do in the beginning let it bloom and then add that to your syrup recast your candies and you're good to go second problem people have is when they take the candy said if they wanted to sugar sugar coat them or lit the sugar sour mix and the it starts to melt once they take them out of the molds if that happens for a couple of reasons one is your refrigerator is very cold and it's very warm in your apartment or your house will cause that because the cold with the warm will cause moisture to happen and the sugar and citric acid are water soluble so obviously it's going to melt to resolve that issue take them out of the fridge allow them to dry for about three or four hours first and the room temperature and starting to dry try a couple of firk try a couple at first and see how they do if they don't melt go ahead and finish doing the batch however if they do mount still melt let them dry overnight and then coat them with sugar you should be fine now another reason that can cause your candies of the sugar to melt is humidity so if you live in a place like Florida and you have a lot of humidity again if you don't have an air-conditioner you want to let them dry out first probably did overnight before you apply the sugar coating again try a couple of first at first see how they do and if they don't as long as they don't melt continue on now if high humidity is an issue for you what you could add is about a quarter of a teaspoon of cornstarch to your sugar mix about an eighth of a teaspoon more than a quarter because the cornstarch will all stick to it and though the sugar will just want to add a little bit of cornstarch to your sugar sour mix that will help with humidity because it will absorb that moisture so those are a few things there that I hope will take care of your sugar bubble tea problem that pretty much is the two major problems that people have with their candies now with regards the other one is the bubbles the air bubbles so if you make the can of butter it with virgin and you use the hand blender you end up with a lot of air bubbles to get rid of that allow your syrup to solidify so throw it in the fridge loud to completely solidify in a pot and then put it on to low heat remelt it and cast it that will take care of your air bubbles that way the other is like I said with the funnel so let me show you this so these were the clear ones that I casted with the with the funnel and as you can see there's no absolutely no air bubbles in this versus the ones that I did do with the bottle let me try and get a white one no they actually settled I know you're gonna have what mom wants to really show you with air bubbles this this round usually I do but yeah so do the as I said to get rid of that use the funnel or allow them to solidify remelt it and no more bubbles for you so that's everything there I'm just gonna take these out of the mold and give you and come back to say goodbye so here check these out don't they look cool like I said ones no air bubbles sticky still bye no air bubbles alright so you're gonna let those dry for about 24 to 48 hours and they'll be good to go and I'm going to show you a little trick here so one thing are dried a lot of you probably find when you put them in packaging they still stick together if you don't use the sugar coating so I'm gonna show you a little trick here how to avoid that okay so to help with that sticky problem all right so to help with that sticky problem what you're going to need is a little bit of cornstarch clear plastic bag or plastic bag and a bowl but you're gonna take something you're gonna take a little bit of cornstarch and you're just gonna sprinkle just a little bit into the bowl you don't want to do too much then take your hand and kind of spread it around this breaks it up and take your candies and just drop them in toss them through your cornstarch I'll cover it so you'll feel they won't stick together anymore and now if you find that you have there is excess on there that you would like to get off like these actually look pretty good but sometimes a little bit more if you use too much a little bit more will get on there you just put them into your bag [Music] and that will help with your sticky sticky problems and the best things to store them in is sello bags or miler bags ziplock baggies um cause them to get moist over time sticky and I found that they cause the absolute most problems so the mylar bags or cell bags are work great so thank you so much for joining me today on this Canon soda pop gummy tutorial if you

review uh today it's going to be liberty brand hemp uh these are the chews cbd chews full spectrum um i tried these last night and they helped me so much with sleep i got good uh sleep i got good rest i felt my eyes getting heavy and i just drifted away to sleep about 30 minutes after i took it so you know i feel like it was very effective the taste was really good let me show you the way that they look it comes in a variety of different flavors this is the gummy right here and it's different colors they have orange they have some green ones some red ones they're very delicious and one of the things i love about it is that it has turmeric and spirulina and that has a lot of benefits to it so it's not just cbd you know you have the full spectrum in there with all the different cannabinoids and then you've got the spirulina and the turmeric which add to the effects um and overall i just love it very strong they're 10 milligrams each so you don't really need to take more than one you know if you take one i think that should be enough unless you have a high tolerance for cbd then you would take more or as desired but uh definitely give this company you know their gummies a shot they're really good i love them they help me with especially with pain too i forgot to mention it gave me some good pain relief and i just love it i think you guys should try them but yeah that's all guys i hope you guys have a great day or night peace out", "5DoDLJ9Jhmg": "in this video I'm going to tell you\neverything you need to know about CBD oil CBD oil can help with a very wide range\nof things it's famous for treating anxiety stress depression epilepsy pain\nand a lot of other things I have tried a lot of supplements to treat my own\nanxiety but found nothing as effective as CBD oil CBD can be taken in different\nways the most common ones are vaping eating and sublingual which means under\nyour tongue each way of usage has its own pros and cons so find out which one\nyou like the most yourself me myself I prefer to use its sibling well since\nit's one of the most purest quickest easiest cheapest and effective ways\nthere are two different types of CBD these are called isolated and\nfull-spectrum the CBD plant contains around 100 cannabinoids isolated means\nit contains only one of them pure CBD with no other components full spectrum\nmeans it contains all of the cannabinoids my advice is to go for a\nfull spectrum full spectrum provides a lot more and way stronger health\nbenefits than just isolated because all the components work together like a\nfootball team creating something like a superpower called the entourage effect\nout of the many cannabinoids the two most famous ones are CBD and THC full\nspectrum also contains a very little bit of THC but you cannot get high from it\nthe amount of THC is less than 0.1% which is way too low to get you high and\nthere is way more CBD in it which works against the effect of getting high so\ndon't be afraid full spectrum will not make you high another very nice thing is\nthat you can't build tolerance to CBD oil\nfor things like THC you can build tolerance but not for CBD because it\ndoesn't bind to your receptors studies even suggest that CBD has the opposite\neffect a reversed tolerance this basically means that you need less from\nit over time instead of more so it works better when it's build up in your system\nalso you cannot overdose on CBD oil it is 100% safe and has no big side effects\nso there is no need to stop using it after a period of time you can keep\nusing it the right dosage is different for everyone and also depends on what\nyou're using it for so it's very hard to give a specific dosage for some things a\nlow dosage works better and for other things a higher dosage works better for\nexample for treating anxiety a low to medium dose will work better than a dose\nthat is too high but for epilepsy a higher dosage is required so it's the\nbest to find a common dosage for your condition and try out for yourself by\nstarting low and upping the dosage till the desired effect is reached for\nanxiety when using the tincture for sublingual use I suggest to start with\naround 7 drops of oil containing 5% CBD when you don't feel any difference you\ncan add a few drops till you found the desired amount for how long the effect\nlasts also differs from person to person and depends on the way of using but when\nusing it sublingual the average time the effect lasts is 4 to 6 hours when using\nsublingually make sure to keep the oil under your\ntongue for at least 2 minutes and after that swirl it around in your mouth\nbefore swallowing this is because you absorb very little when swallowing it\ndirectly it really has to be absorbed under your tongue so it goes directly\ninto the bloodstream there are a lot of good CBD brands but also a lot that are\nbad find out the best rate at CBD brands in\nyour country by looking at reviews these were the basics you need to know about\nCBD if you got any questions ask them in the comment section below don't forget\nto give this video a like subscribe to the channel on turn notifications on\nmore

sour and fizzy kind of like on like the root beer ones you can buy at the store so these are actually like legitimate gummy bears instead of just like Harding jello like a lot of recipes have let me just show you them so you can see the texture of this is like really sticky this is what's making your gummy bears actually be like real store-bought guy bears and not just jello so here's the texture of the gummy make sure when it's still warm so you can really see that string yes this is just like candy nothing like just hard jello that you see recipes for so you know this is gonna be a good one so chewy just like the ones you buy in the store like they're so stretchy just like a gummy bear and like they're fizzy when you eat them so good hey guys welcome back today I'm going to show you how to make Mountain Dew soda bottle gummies I'm going to be using coconut oil to infuse mine but you can use butter or a tincture all three of those options will work for this recipe you're going to need some soda you don't have to use Mountain Dew you can use whatever flavor you like you'll need some jello I chose line because it's the closest to Magic Mountain Dew without like over powering and I'm do flavour some gelatin citric acid corn syrup lecithin potassium sorbate mixture which will keep your products shelf stable so you don't have to put it in the fridge you can just keep it in a drawer or in your car or whoever and I'll post the link for how to make this and some coconut oil you can also use butter or a teacher I actually would prefer to use a tincture for this but I don't have any right now so I'm just going to use coconut oil I made them last night and they turned out really well with the coconut oil I feel like you can taste the coconut oil flavor a little bit more than if you were to use like a tincture but whatever you would like to choose you can use because I made quite a bit yesterday for this recipe I'm going to do a smaller amount in the description box below I'll put the measurements for what I'm doing today but you can make whatever amount you like just multiply the recipe I have it below to make this recipe we're going to have to reduce our soda so that we can get the flavor without too much liquid we need half a cup of soda and then we're going to reduce it to a quarter cup alright we have half a cup here we're going to put on a stove on high and we're going to move let this cook for however long tanks to do half of the mixture so I'm just kind of going to have to eyeball it and see where it is and when it looks like it's a little bit lower I'll pour back my measuring cup and see where I'm at so we started with half a cup so we wanted to be 1/4 cup this will probably take about like 15 minutes now that we have our soda on the stove reducing we're going to prepare our gelatin so we're going to put 1/4 of a cup of our soda into a why dish dish so 1/4 cup and we'll just pour it into a dish and then we're going to put our gelatin on we need one and a half tablespoons of gelatin alright so we put 1/4 cup of soda into this bowl and then we're going to sprinkle a tablespoon and a half of gelatin on top so we're just going to sprinkle it lightly over so we can get as much much coverage as possible so that's one tablespoon and then we're going to do half tablespoon for a total of one and a half tablespoons then we're going to add 1/4 to 1/2 of a jello of flavored jello pack so yesterday I made these with more regular gelatin and no jello pack I need these ones here and while he turned out good I felt like the flavor wasn't strong enough and it needed like a little bit more flavor so I thought this time around I would add a little bit of jello so it can be anywhere between a quarter and a half of this depending on how much flavor you think you want so you can always take this out and measure it but I can just eyeball it we're going to sprinkle this on top so it may be like a third of it and then we're just gonna leave this we're not gonna stir it in we're not gonna do anything with it we're just going to leave it here and by the time you get back around to it most of the gelatin will have absorbed absorbed into the soda now we're going to add an a quarter of a teaspoon of this potassium sorbate mixture again I'll put a link down below this is gonna help it so you don't have to keep it in the fridge you can keep this outside in the fridge it's just like regular got me to buy from a store and then we're going to do a quarter teaspoon of citric acid the citric acid is not necessary it's just if you like them a little bit more sour if you don't have citric acid you could crush up vitamin C tablets and those who work as well so we're doing one quarter teaspoon and then we're gonna add in a teaspoon of lecithin I only have the pill capsules cuz that's what was cheaper for me to buy but if you can buy the liquid kind it would be a lot easier because it'll save you from having to bust these open now my coconut oil already has less of shin in it so I'm not going to add too much this mixture but if your coconut oil doesn't have less its it lecithin in it then you might want to add a little bit more of this so I'm just gonna do one for mine if I had the liquid kind I could just pour oh I probably would just do a quarter teaspoon so this is gonna help bind the coconut oil together with the gelatin liquid mixture so that our coconut oil doesn't separate from everything else and like I said I have more of this already in my coconut oil so I don't need too much in here but if you don't have any in your coconut oil you're going to want to add a bit more to your jello mixture and I barely even got out any with the pills really actually just by the liquid all right now let's check in on our soda we started with half a cup and you need to reduce it to a quarter cup so I'm just going to pour it directly right back into my measuring cup and see we're at all right looks like we're exactly a quarter cup which means I probably should have checked on this sooner that way I couldn't have reduced it too much but if you do end up reducing you too much just throw it away and do it again soda can always be replaced all right so I'm just going to pour my reduced quarter cup of soda back into the pot and then I'm going to add a quarter cup of corn syrup now this is the most important thing for your gummies to be like a real store-bought gummy so corn syrup helps but will helps the most is having the sugar heat it to a high enough temperature to get it almost to the softball stage so I'm gonna use a candy thermometer for that I know most people aren't going to have one of these but if you are planning on making gummies often I usually just purchasing one they're probably like something like ten dollars and they can be very helpful with making your dimes so I'm trying to put it on here and we're going to try and eat this to 230 degrees Fahrenheit now because you guys most of you guys won't have a candy thermometer I'm going to try and see if I could help you out by just telling you the time so I'm going to turn this on high and I'm going to set a timer on my phone or a stopwatch so I started to now and we'll see what time rats when this is got into 230 degrees Fahrenheit all right so we're four minutes in and we're at 180 degrees Fahrenheit and we're waiting for this to go to 230 degrees Fahrenheit so it looks like it's starting to thicken a tiny bit but it's still pretty much all liquid it will started thinking a bit when it gets closer to 30 now you want to be careful to not go over to 30 that's why having a candy thermometer it's good because if you don't have one you can easily within 30 seconds to a minute go over temperature and then it becomes too hard so while having it to that higher temperature we'll give you that real kind bear consistency if you don't have the candy thermometer just ear on the side of not too long because you don't want to ruin it but luckily this is just sugar and soda so if we wreck this mixture and just throw it away and that's why we add the coconut oil after so that we make sure that this mixture is perfect before we add our coconut oil or a tincture or butter that way we're not risking wasting it all right we're at 210 degrees and it's moving up fast so we got to keep an eye on it now now I'm not gonna leave I'm not gonna leave this unattended I'm just gonna watch it up until the moment it gets to 230 Thunder 8 minutes and we're at to 3000 or at 2:30 so we have to take this off now take that off the heat immediately see how fast that happens holy yeah eight minutes on high heat okay this is getting a little too hot so I'm gonna go hold it by the fridge so it doesn't heat up anymore all right so we see how fast the temperature can go up so if you don't have a candy thermometer be very careful to really not let it get too hot you do want it to get as high as you can safely without your candy thermometer because that is what gives a texture the gummy bears but it is hard to do it with other thermometer so I just took this off the heat and left it for about like five minutes so I can demonstrate to you guys what happens here so you can see the texture of this is like really sticky this is what's making your gummy bears actually be like real store-bought guy bears and not just jello so this is the key out this they're just going to be like hard and jello so that's kind of like what it looks like and this is gonna melt back down when we put it back on the stove and mix in our coconut oil now I'm going to turn the heat on like medium I'm going to add two tablespoons of my coconut oil so have some medium heat and stirring in the coconut oil with the soda and corn syrup mixture that we just brought to 230 degrees now we don't want to add in the coconut oil right after it hits 230 we want to take it off the heat we want to let it cool for a little bit like I would say five minutes is fine because we don't want to be adding the coconut oil for something that's 230 degrees because that's too hot all right we're just stirring this in and you can see that it's not actually combining so there's the oil and there is the corn syrup mixture so we're going to need to get a whisk to combine this a little bit better now we're just going to try and stir like this we don't want ki to be too high medium or medium low is good now we're gonna add in our gelatin mixture which is gonna help bind this okay this is getting too hot you can see so I'm gonna turn the heat down to low just take that off for a minute so don't have that I'm too high I would say medium low will be perfect now we're going to add in our gelatin mixture so clearly I had that too warm I should not be bubbling that much so I know I said to put it on medium heat do not put it on medium do medium low or low okay now we just have to be patient and let it melt a bit more so this is the hardest part is getting this all to combine because the texture of the corn syrup might stay chunky and then it won't mix properly but if we keep it at a low enough heat and mix it in with the whisk we should be able to properly combine it and you do want to make sure you have the lesser thin to help emulsify it so this is going to take a while probably going to take about five minutes with me stirring this all in make sure you're patient and you don't turn up the heat trying to melt this fast because that just won't work out well so just keep it at low or medium low to stir this in and do it slowly and by slowly I don't mean whisking slowly but just take your time you can see the chunks are less stuck together now it's starting to combine now you want to make sure before you do this you have your molds prepared so just lay your molds oh and put them on a tree that way as soon as this is done you can pour them in the difference with this and most of the gumming recipes you see online is that this one has a different texture using that corn syrup and heating it up to that own soft ball point so it does harden really fast it is really sticky so once this is done and we're going to want to put it into the molds as soon as we can so I've been stirring this for close to 5 minutes now and almost everything has combined just a couple chunks left on my whisk so I'm just going to push those out with a spatula she's looking really good you can see it has that stringy texture it's not just like liquidy so it looks like it's just about all mix perfectly - that one little chunk there and this took about ten minutes of slowly stirring incorporating on low heat so now we're going to put this into our molds I'm using one of these to put it into my mold but you can also use the little droppers that works fine I just find that this is easier and if you're making a lot of gummies this is really useful overtime to spend like five dollars or whatever it was now I'm going to turn the heat off and pour this mixture right into my little squeezy container if you're going to use the little dropper you can put this on a hot pad and do it directly here whatever works for you okay now use ones I guess that's just a snack for me so that's alright so here's the texture of the gummy make sure when it's still warm she can really see that string yes this is just like candy nothing like just hard jello that you see recipes for so you know this is gonna be a good one so chewy just like the ones you buy in the store alright so I just wrap a towel around here because it's a little bit hot and it's right off the stove and I'm just going to put these into all of my molds you can also just use any molds going bury molds or find you now let's just put these into the fridge it shouldn't take too long probably about 10 minutes all right now we'll just take them out of the mold they were in the fridge for about 20 minutes you can see how they're kind of different than regular jello gummies like they really have that like that sticky gummy bear texture and that stickiness will go away after they dry out for a bit and we put their coating on you all right so now for coating on them I did in three different ways I did one with sugar coating one with a fizzy coating and then some with no coding so the ones on the top here I was just sugar so I just shook it in a container of sugar and put it back on the tray and then for the fizzy coating it's one third of a cup of sugar one teaspoon citric acid and then I'm going to say 1 teaspoon baking soda but that was too much baking soda so do half a teaspoon baking soda instead so here's that teaspoon of baking soda but like I said we're going to use half a teaspoon not a full teaspoon like I did you could taste it too much and I'm just gonna mix that up quickly once I just shake that up I'm gonna add the gummies into it shake it again and put them back on the tray the one thing I do want to mention with this recipe is you can put them in their sugar or citric acid mixture as soon as they come out of their mold whereas with some of the jello recipes you need them to drive it first these ones you don't need to do that so you can put them on right away in that way you can make sure they really stick whereas if they get too dry they won't the sugar won't stick to the outside of the gummy and if that does happen to you you can just spray them with a little bit of water and just wipe them off so they're a little bit damp and that stickiness comes back and that should work for you quite honestly I kind of enjoyed them with nothing on them the most but I really did enjoy the fizzy sugary coating anyways that's all you guys I hope you enjoyed this video please comment if you try it out and if you did enjoy it please

you wouldn't mind hit that subscribe button if you are new here to the channel and if you already have subscribed thank you very much and if you wouldn't mind please give the video a big thumbs up to show your support so today guys I gotta tell you to get to this point to share this recipe with you has been a long road by far this gummy recipe has taken me the longest to develop in the kitchen I have tried everything under the Sun on the internet to make gummies and believe it or not the simplest of recipes is the best and easiest way to make gummies at home now today I am just going to be showing you my plain-jane gummi recipe if you are interested in infusing those gummies I encourage you to check out my video on infusing gummies and I can leave that link in the description below go ahead and check it out but for today this is just a three ingredient gummy recipe that you can make at home now the cool thing about gummies is that you can buy molds on Amazon for anything you can have Star Wars gummies you can have worms you can have bears you can have anything you want it's a really just a family fun event that you can make in the kitchen and it shouldn't be that complicated one of my biggest critiques of the internet on these recipes was why is everybody making it out to seem so complicated it's not it really is not three ingredients go to your local grocery store and you can find them and I'm gonna show you when we get into the kitchen and you could have gummies within an hour this whole recipe takes about 15 minutes total it's crazy easy but I gotta say to get to this point I did a lot of convoluted recipes with bloomin and cooking and God it was just awful it was awful everybody had a different take on how to get to that point where it was a nice gummy and it's just not that hard guys I hate to break it to you it's not that hard whoever is making these recipes make him seem hard I got to assume Heather don't know what they're doing in the kitchen or they're really just trying a roundabout way to make it seem harder than it is so that most people don't do it which you know it is what it is but today I'm gonna share with you the easy 15-minute three ingredient gummi recipe that you can have and share share along with all your other friends and then again guys if you want to infuse them go ahead and check out that video I'll leave that link in the description below so let's jump into the kitchen let me show you what we're doing in there and then let's start making some gummies alright folks before we get started on today's recipe I want to make sure that you have everything you need to get started so first you will need a small stove pot a Pyrex measuring cup definitely highly recommend the Pyrex measuring cup a fork for mixing and of course gummy molds and a big thank you to magical for sending these gummy molds so the ingredients are as follows and these are the three simple ingredients unflavored gelatin flavored gelatin and fruit juice now with the fruit juice you want to make sure that it's refrigerated you want it to be at a cold temperature and that's key for this recipe so the first thing we're going to do is we are going to measure out our fridges and that's going to be 1/3 of a cup so that's right about there sorry for the mess there let me clean that up ok so now that you have your 1/3 cup of fruit juice and in this case we have pineapple fruit juice now it's not from concentrate and I think that makes a big deal I did experiment with concentrate and it just doesn't come out as well it's not as flavorful it's still gels fine but the flavor isn't there but the next thing you'll need is one package grams of just unflavored gelatin and so once you add that you want to mix it around now you can use a spoon I just prefer for cuz I feel like it breaks it up a little bit better and you want to make sure that most of the chunks of the gelatin are out and this is very key all right so now that that's mixed around I'll bring it up to you and show you there's no chunks in it all the gelatin is dissolved now you're gonna take your flavored three ounce gelatin and put it in there now in this case guys this flavor is just one of the flavors I like I like the orange pineapple it gives it that very tropical flavor and you can mix and match with fruit juices and flavors this is just one that I really like and so as you can see it's starting to dissolve and get going so now we need to let this sit for 10 minutes okay so we just let it sit for 10 minutes and while that's going on what I like to do is put water in the pot and get that up to temperature so when this is done we can get it right into the pot so right now I'm gonna go fill this with water and get it up to temperature meanwhile this has to sit for 10 minutes so I'll see you guys in 10 minutes all right folks welcome back it has been 10 minutes our timer has gone off and so right now this is the blooming stage of the gelatin so now that that's all set our water is nice and warm we're going to lower this into the water and we're going to mix it around now this process takes about anywhere between three to eight minutes depends on how hot your water is you don't want to boil it you just want hot water now you could microwave this for like two to three minutes and then bring it out but the last thing you want to do is burn the gelatin it will not come out correctly I have tried it in the microwave it is super simple but you have to be very careful so you have to check it about every 30 to 45 seconds once it gets past a minute thirty because every microwave is different so that's why I like the stove but feel free I will leave the instructions on how to use a microwave in the description below so for the next three to eight minutes depending on how hot my water was when I put it in there I'm gonna wait for this to get ready and meantime make sure that your molds are clean and ready to go so I will see you in a few minutes and again guys if you're looking to use the microwave I'll leave those instructions in the description below so I'll see you in a few minutes all right folks so it's been about three minutes and the gelatin is now a very liquid consistency now this is really what you want you don't want to really boil it or do anything like that you just want it in a nice liquid form and this is why the Pyrex is so important because you can put it directly in to warm boiling type water on the stove without having to worry about any issue so that's why I say folks that you really want to use the Pyrex measuring cup again you can put it in the microwave I just you know don't prefer it and I don't really like and I really don't like giving instructions on using a microwave because everybody's microwave is so different with the wattage and stuff and how powerful it is so that's why I lean towards using the stove now as you saw guys in the time-lapse video I added a cutting board and the cutting board is just so it's less mess it's not necessarily required but it definitely creates less of a mess when you go to bring it into the fridge so this looks like it's all ready to go so I'm going to turn our stove off here and I'm going to pick up our bottle and we'll just dry off the bottom real quick so that no water leaks in to our mold next thing I'm going to do is I'm just gonna pour all the molds it's as simple as that so I'm gonna pour these and then we'll go have it set in the fridge all right folks so now I'm just gonna have these go into the fridge and sit for about an hour meanwhile while that's occurring you're gonna want to make sure that you wash out this Pyrex it will become extremely sticky so you're gonna want to make sure that you rinse this out and get all that gelatin out of the Pyrex disk so you can reuse it and it's not a pain to wash so I'm gonna go to let these sit in the refrigerator for about an hour and then I'm gonna show you the final product so I've taken the gummies out of the fridge and I popped a few out of the molds to show you here they are they look great you know some of them have this like like a bubbly back that's normal you can cut that off if you really want just for presentation purposes but overall to get that you have to just get rid of that bubbles you have to just kind of like take a spoon over it just to take the bubbles off of it but I didn't really do that for this process these are for my own personal consumption yeah they pop out of the molds really easy you just go like that and off they come so yeah real easy recipe these were in the fridge a lot longer than I normally do is I just got busy here at the house and you know forgot about them so they were in there for about 12 hours you don't have to leave them in any longer than two hours but for this time we just you know left them in the fridge I had got busy but if you guys have any questions about this recipe feel free to leave a comment below or send me an email on that information will be in the description below and as always folks you can find me on Instagram and Facebook those links will be in the description below also and I really hope you enjoyed this recipe but until next time take care and I will see you in another video", "p6fnrYwPPGQ": "well hello everybody it's me autumn nice to see you guys live uh away from this channel for a while but you know just taking a little bit of time i started my new job and enjoying my time away from the internet so you know today i am here to talk to you guys a little bit about something that i've been using for the past two years now something that's really been helping me with my anxiety um cbd i credit cbd oil as being something that has helped me the most with my anxiety of anything i've never been on anti-anxiety medication this was kind of my way of seeing if i could self-medicate a little bit because i didn't want to deal with the possible side effects of anti-anxiety medication so yeah decided to try cbd oil i've been taking it for so long at this point that i don't really notice the effects unless i stop taking it i feel a lot more anxious my social anxiety in particular gets really bad overall just helps me feel more relaxed feel more normal feel more baseline so you may have noticed a couple days ago i posted on my twitter about how 5cbd which is a company that makes cbd products sent me some stuff some goodies they in particular sent me some full spectrum cbd gummies i will explain what all that means to you in a second but um i am going to be talking about how i felt about those and i'm also going to be answering some questions that you guys asked me on twitter so let's get into it so first let me show you guys um what they sent me because they sent me a bunch of stuff which is awesome so really quick just want to point out this box that they send it in because it was really cute it has all their branding on it and hey look you can find them on twitter facebook and instagram so really quick i'll show you guys two of the things that they sent me that i'm actually not really gonna be talking about today but still really cool products that they have and definitely worth checking out please excuse my beautiful acne uh i did not have time to put on makeup before i shot this video yay so one thing that they did send me they sent me these sleep gummies they have melatonin in it i haven't taken any because i don't like melatonin personally it tends to make me feel weird so i've been steering away from it but man if i liked melatonin i would definitely take them because cbd is super relaxing and will help you go to sleep they also sent me this tincture so it's just basically you put some of the drops under your tongue i'm definitely going to try this once i'm done with my current bottle of my current brand and finally this is what we're going to be talking about today this is called the daily buzz it is a daily use cbd full spectrum gummy all things that are really cool and i'll tell you guys why also i know this is obvious but it's worth saying i'm not a doctor i'm somebody who has just found relief with using cbd for my anxiety if you are ever planning on taking cbd discuss it with your doctor first especially if you're on any other kind of medication always a good thing to talk with your doctor before trying anything that is affecting your body in any way i think that's just a good mo to go with so cbd is short for cannabinoid oil it is the second most active ingredient in cannabis so five is the new cbd brand they have a full line of hemp products that i just showed you guys um it is all full spectrum so what is full spectrum what does that mean full spectrum cbd product is something that contains all of the different cannabinoids that exist inside of a hemp plant full spectrum products actually do this thing which is called the entourage effect so all the different natural cannabinoids all kind of work together um and boost each other up and give you different benefits so yeah five in particular is very meaningful about driving this relationship of all the different cannabinoids together making sure that you're getting a full spectrum product they're very particular about that which i appreciate because there's a lot more to cbd than just the cbd part so like i showed you guys earlier they do have a bunch of different products i showed you guys the sleep gummies i showed you guys a tincture but these boys let's talk about these boys today or girls or whatever they don't have to have a gender so they sent me these ones which are 50 milligrams of total cannabinoids per gummy these ones have 4.8 milligrams of thc in them that's kind of a lot for me i'm not gonna lie i'm very sensitive to thc i think i've said that already a couple times in this video they do however have an original strength which is 25 milligrams of total cannabinoids per gummy and it's only 0.8 milligrams of thc if you're really sensitive to thc i would suggest taking those i will say however even being sensitive to thc there was definitely a noticeable effect but it did not at all make my anxiety worse it did not at all make me feel bad in any way it was actually a really nice effect i was very relaxed i felt very alert and awake i felt very energized so it was a really nice effect i did notice the thc though and i'm just continuing to say that you know if you're somebody like me who's sensitive to that and maybe doesn't want that feeling all the time i would suggest the weaker gummies i didn't get to try them but i'm definitely going to because even with like me being as much of a baby with thc as i am i actually really enjoyed these and they made me feel really good the thc aside i also noticed what i noticed with my other cbd it made me feel a lot calmer it made me feel a lot more like i was just able to function normally as opposed to how i feel naturally i'm sure a lot of you can relate when you have anxiety it's kind of hard to just do anything like everything feels like a mountain that's been one of the best things about cbd and these were no different they made me feel the same way it just helped me kind of realize that those mountains that i'm climbing are actually like tiny little hills and i don't need to worry about them that much they also taste and smell like so good i keep opening them and just like sniffing them because they smell like candy and they taste like candy that's something that's really nice about these the normal cbd that i take is oil and it tastes very much like weed like it just tastes like dirt and weed this actually tastes good and it's like a daily cbd thing that i could also do so that is a huge plus this is also for what it is very cheap the current brand that i'm taking is really expensive i pay for it because obviously i was looking for a really good full spectrum product i was looking for something that had lab reports that i could verify you know everything they were saying about their product was accurate this has all that it's full spectrum you can go to their website and they have full lab reports breaking down everything that's inside the bottles and verifying everything that they say is inside the bottles like these extra strength ones of the daily buzz which is 30 gummies this is 60 the oil that i take is uh let's see i think the last bottle i spent like three hundred dollars on it and the ones that are the original strength or even cheaper they're forty dollars that's like a steal for cbd products so huge plus yeah i think in general i'm definitely going to continue to take these i probably will limit it to weekends or times when i'm not really doing too much again i personally am really sensitive to thc so i just try to be mindful of that but i'm definitely planning on buying the original strength ones and trying those out as more of a daily thing that i can take i've been looking for a long time for another cbd brand that i can take in conjunction with what i'm taking now and hey these are cheaper if the original strength gummies are good i might entirely get rid of my other brand and just switch to these oh my god i wish i could transmit a smell through the camera they smell so good and i think i just want candy it's almost halloween right five cbd is actually offering a free bottle of the daily buzz gummies right now again that's like you know a 60 value for free i mean you have to pay shipping whatever all right so now i'm going to answer the questions that you guys asked me on twitter this is kind of a topic that i'm very interested in and something that i've been exploring over the past two years and so yeah hopefully this is helpful to those of you who suffer from anxiety and want to try something to see if it helps all right so this question is from humanoid sharks on twitter they asked i struggle with bad insomnia and recently started vaping thc weedpod things to help me sleep it does the job but the problem is i don't like being goofy high every night with cbd help me fall asleep and more importantly stay asleep yes for me it definitely does that i think just because in general it lowers your anxiety for me it just brings me back down to a baseline where everything is easier like i have more of an appetite i'm more able to perform at work i'm more able to do social things and yes i'm able to sleep easier because my anxiety in general is lowered kind of in the same vein ll coolray14 asks i know cbd can help with sleep but do you ever feel drowsy when waking up that's my biggest concern no i don't feel with my normal cbd that i take i don't feel anything i never feel groggy i never feel weird i never feel high even these like when i took them that one day i didn't feel groggy waking up i didn't feel groggy at all and i actually felt extremely well rested the next morning so no no grogginess this question is from one armed gambit and they asked i suffer from bad pain due to cerebral palsy which usually ends up with me not getting any sleep with cbd help me with pain and or sleep thank you so i don't use it for pain primarily i do have chronic bladder pain um but i never used cbd to treat that really so i can't really speak to it i will say that i can't remember the last time i had a flare-up now whether or not that coincides with the cbd use i couldn't really say i haven't really been tracking it i will say there are tons of people out there who speak specifically to the fact that cbd has helped them tremendously with their pain their chronic issues cbd works with your own body's endocannabinoid system it's one of the regulatory systems that's naturally found in your body it's not to be one of the things that regulates you and kind of keeps you out of homeostasis if you're experiencing pain i definitely suggest trying it again talk to your doctor first before trying anything but there's so many people who swear by this stuff for pain give it a shot so this question is from pink hardy and they asked as someone who uses weed daily what are their feelings like compared to each other so i don't like weed i don't really smoke it ever i don't really enjoy how it makes me feel this stuff made me feel so like energized and just i felt so relaxed like i don't know how to describe it i just felt like everything was fine normal and like i could carry on about my life without having to worry about anything it was a very pronounced effect and it was great it's very different from weed i wouldn't even compare the two to be honest this question is from mr tom finney who asks what aspect of anxiety do they help with can they help you manage scenarios that trigger panic attacks like flying or public speaking etc so cbd is not something that i think you should use as like a break the glass emergency panic scenario for me again it's been something that i take every day that's kind of an upkeep thing although i guess depending on how you react to something like this that has a little bit more thc in it this might actually help in a situation like that but again i would take this particular strength on a day where you're not doing anything you're not doing anything stressful just to see how it makes you feel okay this question is from demon locks they asked how does it help you is it more of a daily dose where you take a small amount a day or do you take the cbd when you're feeling anxious how do you regulate it do you just dose with pills or do you dose with other forms i've actually answered some of these but i'll go through this anyway so how does it help me the most pronounced area that cbd helps me is with my social anxiety before i started taking cbd i really could not like function around other people i was just really shy and really nervous i didn't enjoy interacting with people that is one of the first things that cbd really really helped me with it lowered my social anxiety so much it also helped my general anxiety just come down like a couple notches which is really helpful just in my life i'm a much more confident person now i'm a much more reasonable person now um i know anxiety is a struggle for a lot of people because it makes life feel impossible in general it's helped everything kind of just screw down a couple notches which is awesome so that's how it's helped me how i take it so i take my cbd oil sublingually so under the tongue i put it under my tongue for about a minute every morning when i wake up i take it with the rest of my vitamins take it after i eat the cbd that you get will give you instructions on how to take it best they'll give you dosing amounts you should kind of test it out to see what feels best for you but to start with a really low dose and to kind of work your way up you just never really know everybody's different so you can't really tell um from the start how you're going to react to it so this question is from leijen sirket and they asked are you clinically diagnosed with an anxiety disorder or is this more minor anxiety i say minor in quotes because obviously anxiety is awful so i'm clinically diagnosed with general anxiety disorder i don't think that's rare nowadays there's a whole lot of stuff to be anxious about i'm someone who like has clinical anxiety i could get medication for it if i wanted it and cbd has been more than enough to help me with the day-to-day managing of it the amount of functioning that cbd has given back to me is huge no shame if you need medication a lot of people do our brains are different some people need more help than others and this is the last question i'm going to take from you guys this is from an epic nguyen on twitter they asked does cbd help with mental clarity i.e help to keep the mind focused and on task absolutely that's something i can emphatically say this stuff not gonna lie i was expecting it to make me feel high i was expecting it to make me feel groggy i was expecting me to be couched a little bit it didn't do any of those things it made me feel really energetic it made me feel very clear i was very productive that day all right well hopefully that helped some of you honestly i learned a lot about cbd on the cbd subreddit so shout out to that place that's a really good spot to go if you're like curious about cbd and kind of curious about what will work for you and what's a good place to buy products from because there's a lot out there there's a lot of sketchy cbd companies out there five cbd is awesome again they have their lab reports on their website so you can verify everything that they're telling you is true please look for that if you're looking for a cbd brand it's really really important so yeah hopefully this was helpful to you guys again 5cbd is currently giving away a free bottle of this stuff the daily buzz gummies the link for that is in the description it is a limited time offer but you can snag you one right now so again that link is in the description below and hey just for ships and giggles i'll put it up on the screen oh my god i know this is the first time i've been back and it's like a sponsored video sorry if you're expecting something different but you know again i'm just settling into my new job i am relaxing i'm getting the hell away from the internet it feels good i will be back at some point i don't know when i don't know why i don't know how um but i'll be around hopefully this was something fun in the meantime if any of you ever have other questions about cbd about five cbd in particular or about anything else please feel free to ask me i love this stuff i find it very interesting or again i will plug the cbd subreddit i think it's a really good place to go to find good information please make sure you're talking to your doctor before trying anything cbd related please also make sure that you are verifying that the cbd you're getting is from a good source well i hope everybody has a great day today thank you so much for tuning in and i will talk to you guys when i talk to you guys peace", "vLm9VAXFl6I": "and so I'd still take my life in it a fruit roll-up what's up guys welcome back today I have yet another gummy video for you guys and I'm very excited about this one because I think it's going to make a lot of people's lives a lot easier and it is going to be delicious today we're going to be doing a little experiment making gummies out of two ingredients store-bought gummy bears tincture or coconut oil so I just bought some gummies from bulk barn any gummies are fine and what I'm gonna do is I'm going to melt these down and I'm gonna add to some of them tincture and to some of them coconut oil and we're gonna see how they're going to turn out I think the ones with tincture will turn out amazing the coconut oil ones I'm not so sure about so let's try it out and see how it goes PS these are like the best gummies ever they're the Albanese brand you can buy them at a lot of places and they're so good they have like the best flavors the green ones and the white ones are my favorite so I'm actually not going to use them for this recipe so I'm probably gonna eat them while I'm melting them first step is to sort your gummies you don't have to smoke them if you don't want to but I want all my colors to be separate all right let's do this so I separated my gummies into yellow and orange purple and then my favorite ones just to eat while I'm doing this and we're gonna melt them and then add in our ginger and coconut oil and see how it goes I have no idea how long it's going to take us to microwave them so I'm going to start with like 15 second intervals and just check on them and then we'll find out how long it takes to melt them without over putting them I don't know so start with these great ones here there's a total of 13 gummy bears in here and they're just regular sized right there I mean they're a little bit bigger than like kuriboh gummy bears um but they're pretty standard so I was going bears and you guys can even see that okay so I'm gonna check on them in about 15 seconds and see how warmed up and melted they are so that's 20 seconds and they're starting to melt but they still need a little bit more so I put it in there for another 10 seconds okay so this is a total of 30 seconds pretty much melted and good to go I'm gonna add my tincture into here for this amount of gummies I'm going to do 1/2 a teaspoon of tincture so it's just room temperature you don't want to have it like really cold or frozen because it will affect the heat from the gummy so we'll just put that half a teaspoon in so there it is and let's see how well this stirrer is in if it doesn't stir it hopefully you guys can see that can you oh you guys can't even see that there we go so hopefully that stirs in well and if it doesn't we are going to add some lesson and lecithin into this to help combine it but I think that there's enough things and the gummy bears to start with that we shouldn't have any issues getting this to emulsify or combine or whatever you want to call it so that looks pretty good and then we're just gonna put these into a mold the same way you would with homemade gummies and let them sit and we will move on to our next batch so this is quite a bit thicker then they're coming mixtures so it seems like it's kind of hard for the little syringe to pull it up so that's one a little bit of an issue here so let's see yeah see we can't really soak it up so our options would be to microwave it more so it gets more liquidy or to add more liquid but I do not want to add more liquid so I am going to put it in the microwave for another 10 seconds okay so that was another ten seconds for a total of 30 are sorry a total of 40 seconds and I think they should be good enough to be able to put into our molds so I have about half in the mold then it's being a little bit trickier to put in that I thought it was going to be I'm having some trouble like getting the the dropper to like suction it up and that's because it is really thick so again I'm going to put it into the microwave for another 10 seconds and warm it up some more now if you had a lot more going there zero melting I'm like I did it this won't be as much of an issue because the heat will contain itself because there's a larger amount because there's such a small amount that's getting cooled off quicker and thickening faster and also like my dropper is like has a limited stuff to suck up so that won't be if you're doing a larger amount but it's not hurting anything by putting it in the microwave for just like 10-15 second intervals you just have to make sure you work kind of fast so let's throw that back in okay so looks a little different now I guess it just melted a lot more it's a lot more liquidy and put these interim moles okay so I put the purple ones into a molds now let's try some more but with the coconut oil let's do the yellow ones one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen so we'll do thirteen of them just like we did last time and then we're gonna microwave this I'm going to start it with 40 seconds okay here's our 40 seconds melted they're nice and liquidy still might be a bit of an issue with the syringe dropper thing but if you have like one of those bottles you can dispense them with that'll be like way easier but let's add in the coconut oil so I hope you know what nut oil is what I expect to be the most difficult but I think that there's already less lecithin in the gummy bears so the oil should be able to emulsify pretty good but we'll find out so let's have it half a teaspoon of coconut oil okay we got our half teaspoon let's mix that in so so far it's actually mixing in really well that's all something I do for gummy bears with tincture instead of coconut oil because they I think they taste better but I know that most people you should just have coconut oil on hand the texture is a little bit different with the coconut oil I'm going to put that back in the microwave for another like 15 seconds alright so I did another 10 seconds I thought 15 might be too much all right now let's put these in their molds it looks like it's a lot harder using these so I'm gonna use one of my squeeze bottles which will be a lot you hear well I guess I should say hopefully it will be a lot easier you can see that like the coconut oil's making it like that doesn't like stick to the sides of the bottle that much I'm actually very surprised how well the cup oil mixed in oh my god that's so hot oh god it burns okay so don't touch hot melted candy because it is really hot and it hurts okay and this is cooled off a bit now that I've changed the bottle so hopefully it comes out okay if not I'll put it until I got a hot bowl of water or something look at all that gelatin or gummies sitting on the top there and I gotta get him down I'm just gonna leave this to sit upwards to get this to come down guys it's just it's it's too sticky this didn't really work that well either I'm gonna take the metal cap off and I'm gonna put it in the microwave just like this hopefully that works okay I did it ten seconds in the microwave it still doesn't look like it's gonna come out like this No okay this is not working either see another way that we can get this into the mold I mean like it's still gonna taste delicious I'm probably gonna have to eat a lot of this like just peel out of the bowl and stuff okay my plan was to cut a hole and squish this through but I don't think that's gonna happen well let's let's try see oh it's working okay I mean it's a little hardened now Oh No okay this is not working very well okay so the melting of the gummy bears and adding coconut oil didn't work very well I don't know why it seems like it almost got like harder like I now I'm just wondering if I like I microwaved it too many times like I don't know it just it won't come out really it's too thick to come out of anything so I'm gonna make another batch with the tincture just to test that out um again and see it's like it's definitely going to work or if it's user error and I mean it still I'd still take my get it a fruit roll-up it still tastes good if you wanted to you just melt them and then I mean this is really good little easy to get through oh look but you could just melt it and put it onto like parchment paper or silicone and peel it off after and just cut it into strips it's like the same thing it just won't be in the molds the actual gummy product mixed really well - coconut oil it tastes amazing of course you just they just happen to make sure it's pretty making the mold so still work very good I'll be snacking on this later okay let's do some more with the orange gummies and let's put some more tincture and then this time 1112 where do we do 13 or 12 I remember 30 I think and you don't have to do 13 so it's just the number I'm doing I don't know just - just what it is I'm doing and yeah you can just use whatever amount you want obviously you're really good okay let's microwave this you've got 30 seconds we're gonna do double the tincture so one teaspoon instead of half a teaspoon see this looks like it might have been too much tincture too much liquid and they might not set but you could always add more gelatin but I have a feeling these will set they'll just be a lot softer but if you want them to be able to firmer you could just add a sprinkle of gelatin a little more liquidy consistency as will definitely be easier to put into our moulds hopefully this one works a bit better I think it will we just got to act fast I mean using a dropper I probably would've been fine I don't know why decided to use this because it's such a small amount coming out already there we go oh yeah that's perfect oh and also just FYI if you buy these bottles which are really great for gummy making when you're making larger amounts not like this much died by making the tape it comes with like this I don't know if you can see that it's really really small and the gummy mixture is usually too thick to come out so I just put a different tip that's a little bit wider on there to make sure it can get through this was really difficult to use with such a small amount that I had so use a dropper if you have one this is usually my go-to option to squeeze things into molds but because there is such little amount when I squeeze it it's not really doing anything whereas if there was like this much gummy make sure when I squeeze it the pressure would push it out but because I made such a small amount obviously it's gonna be a little bit trickier I will just eat this out of the bottle later I'm just going to put the gummies that I need into the fridge probably for like 20 minutes alright guys I'm back but it hasn't been 20 minutes it's been two days so I took the gummies Oh after 20 minutes and they were not nearly hard enough I couldn't even really get them out of their molds so I put them in the freezer for a little bit like about half an hour and once they were hard enough I popped them all out of their molds and just left them on some parchment paper but they still were a little bit too squishy and too like corn syrupy so I left them out for a day and they were still a little bit too squishy Tomo for another day which is where we are now so it's been two days and they are perfect so if you guys make these just leave them out on a piece of parchment paper for a couple days depending on how humid it is wherever you live it might be a little bit different like it's not very humid where I live at all um so they dry up pretty quick but if you live somewhere very humid they might take a lot longer to dry or they might even not work for you in the first place so I'll show you what they look like so both the purple and the orange ones turned out very well you can see they're sticky obviously because they are sticking to my fingers so they are a little bit stickier than like a regular gummy but they're they don't really stick together in the bag because I've let them dry out for a few days so the purple ones had half a teaspoon of tincture in them and the orange ones had double that amount so they had one teaspoon of tincture and I thought they were gonna have a lot of issues but they're totally fine yeah they turned out very well and they taste just like the gummies did before I remoulded them last thing just to clarify um my gummies with the coconut oil didn't turn out only the ones with the tincture worked for me I don't know why the coconut oil ones didn't work if you guys know why please let me know because I'm very curious so yeah guys these turned out fantastic I'm super impressed with the results I definitely am gonna use this method many times in the future um going forward what I would do is for every 10 dummies I would do half a teaspoon of tincture so you can just multiply that by however many you want to make in total but based on what I've seen with these with half a teaspoon and the regular teaspoon they both turned out so you couldn't probably get away with using a little bit more but if you're looking for a starting point I would go with ten nine bears and half a teaspoon all right please let me know if you guys try this out I hope you enjoyed the video and let me know if there's any videos you would like to see I hope you guys enjoyed this video please comment like and subscribe thank you guys for watching have a wonderful day", "i-JX7qnWkR0": "[Music] kitty up so the ingredients that we're going to need for our gummies are pretty much the same as the original you're gonna want two packages of the um jello this is the three ounce the small box or 85 grams whatever flavor you'd like two tablespoons or two packages of unflavored gelatin so two packages of those nox unflavored gelatin a half a cup of water room temperature and a half a cup of water ice cold you have to have ice cold water to bloom gelatin we're going to want a quarter cup of light corn syrup for those of you who don't like like do not like corn syrup you can use invert sugar glucose honey or a gob you just need a syrup in there and what it does is it creates a barrier between your sugar crystals so that they don't come back together that's why it's needed some type of syrup we are going to need a quarter cup of can of butter a quarter teaspoon of citric acid a half a teaspoon of gour gum and gorgum is an emulsifier which allows us to bring oil and water together because as everybody knows they are mortal enemies so in order for them to be able to become friends you use an emulsifier and what an emulsifier will do is it takes each molecule a water molecule and an oil they go in together in a bubble and it creates a bubble around uh those two molecules so it creates its own um kind of uh it creates an emulsion that's what it does and that's what emulsion is bringing oil and water together to be a uniform liquid you cannot use xanthan gum it is not an emulsifier it is a thickener and it is a stabilizer it is not an emulsifier gum is an emulsifier a stabilizer and a thickener as well as it has a natural gummy uh texture to it which helps with your gummies and for those of you who don't use it or can't get it uh you can use soy it would be one teaspoon of soy or sunflower lecithin the other reason why i like the gourd gum is it has no flavor whereas lecithin does and i don't like the flavor less of them in substitute of water if you want to add a little bit more flavor boost you can use these kool-aid jammers or the kool-aid waters or basically any juice that doesn't contain real fruit if you do use a juice that has real fruit you have to use a mold inhibitor like this little the lorraine's mold inhibitor and that is a must otherwise they will go moldy in a couple of weeks then this is optional this and alcohol or um everclear the 94 alcohol or grain alcohol a really cool trick alert with this uh which you'll have to wait till the end to see it um but yeah this is an option um or if you make tincture you can use your tincture provided it is made with the high percentage alcohol it has to be the 94 ish around there for flavorings you can use the lorraine flavor oils i'm today i'm going to be making uh lemon raspberry so i'm going to start with a lemon base split it up split out half raspberry and make the other half of them and make them look all pretty gel food coloring now if you want to create a solid background white food coloring a thing with this you can only use one or two drops if you use too much your gummies will not set no matter what you can freeze them you doesn't matter what you do they will not set if you use too much very important one or two drops only and i think i've got all the ingredients here covered let's get into that equipment and then let's get these made all right so the equipment that we are going to need is basically the same as the old recipe there is one major difference we are going to throw away the immersion stick or the hand blender that apparently is a very bad thing for our gelatin so on top of creating a mountain of air bubbles so that your gummies don't turn out nice and clear it also breaks the gelatin so for any of you have this white goopy stuff on the top of your candies the silicone spatula or silicone whisk is going to resolve that issue so we're not going to use the hand blender silicone only metal will damage uh the gelatin who knew it was such a delicate little flower so silicone spatula very important silicone or a wooden spoon a little strainer or a bigger one if you've got one doesn't have a small one a small um saucepan heavy bottom is preferable and on heat transfer which means when you look at the bottom of your pot there is no discoloring um it's always one even if it is discolored in spots it means that your pot gets hotter in those particular areas and it can damage your uh your product so heavy bottom not heat transfer is the best thing to go for you of course your gummy molds these bottles are one of the best for dispersing your um dispensing your syrup into the into the molds they're by a sweet sugar bell and two reasons i like is because it uses the decorating tips which makes it nice as well as they have a very deep um lip to them whatever you call this a lip screw thing if you use the dollar store ones or ones that um have the really short short neck on them and then uh you're more likely it's the lids gonna pop off because the syrup is warm there's not a lot well the pressure on it it just pops them off so fair warning either that or um one of these candy funnels uh works great as well or the little odd dropper things that those some of those molds come with you're going to need some parchment paper and a drying rack i think i have most of the equipment covered you know me i always forget something um so let's jump right into those ingredients and let's get this made so on to making our candies so the very first thing we want to do is to bloom our gelatin so i've got my two tablespoons of gelatin here and you want to um sprinkle it onto your ice cold water and as i said for gelatin to bloom correctly water has to be i size very very very cold so we just want to sprinkle it across the top so this way it doesn't clump and then you're going to stir it into the water make sure it's well mixed in and that there's no lumps now one tip for you when you're doing this with your unflavored gelatin while you're mixing it it should start to um form into the texture of um of applesauce if it doesn't then you need to add a little bit more gelatin either your gelatin is not as strong or used a little too much water over whatever it is it's probably not going to be um quite enough so like this is just a little too soupy so i'm going to add in just a sprinkle there we go so that's more the texture that you want see like applesauce and then i usually toss mine into the fridge until i need it so i've added my um two boxes of jello to my pot already and then in goes our light corn syrup or whatever syrup you choose to use and yes you can use can of syrup and our other half a cup of water now this is one thing i learned the citric acid does not go in until the end so you never had your citric acid while you're preparing once everything's done and heated that's when you add in your citric acid the acid works like acid it melts things so it interferes with the cooking or the setting process if you add it in too early same thing if you use the cooked version make sure to only add it once you're done so once you've got your water and your corn syrup and your jello in the pot you just want to get her mixed and turn your heat onto low so we don't need to use a double board a double boiler as long as you keep it on lower minimum you're good if you start to see any white streaking take it off the heat immediately so you're just going to continue to stir this until the sugar and everything is dissolved okay so i've been stirring on low heat here for about 10 minutes we're pretty much done so you look at the bottom there and you can see it's it's nice and clear and when you stream it it looks clear so now that portion is done we are going to get our unflavored gelatin now that our jello and our corn syrup and that is done we are now turned off our heat this is when we're going to add in our citric acid uh so a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and again citric acid is what prevents your sugar from crystallizing right essentially it's an acid and it continues to melt things there is such a science and chemistry with sugar and water and acids and stuff it's like wow mind blowing so quarter teaspoon of citric acid in there give her a little gentle stir so next goes in our unflavored gelatin what i like to do is to cut it up into little squares makes it easier to melt and so we're just going to let them sit there for just a minute or so and then you just want to gently stir until your until the unflavored gelatin is all completely melted then once your gelatin is all melted and everything is a uniform color and texture that's how you know everything is melted and night skins come together everybody's being friends in the pot now we're going to add our can of butter and our gourgum so in goes our butter half a teaspoon of our gum and i use the strainer um so that it'll evenly distribute it over the uh butter um otherwise it can clump up and as well you want to make sure to sprinkle it onto the butter part and not the candy syrup because again if it hits the syrup part it'll clump the oil or the butter will make it melt it's a pretty wild uh ingredient i have to admit we're just gonna get that evenly sprinkled over our butter and we're gonna let that sit for one minute all right after it's been sitting there for about a minute we're going to start to whisk this now you don't want to go crazy whisking because as i said too hard breaks our gelatin it is going to break it a little bit but we don't want to go too gentle because we actually have to create be able to break that oil down small enough so that it can create an emulsion so it's finding that happy medium so i just kind of get it started here so we're trying to whisk with minimal air bubbles and then we have a look and take a look at the top and see if you see any kind of oil slick if you do continue to whisk it a little bit longer and then check it again if you still see some oil um coming up to the top you see some oil slicks happening we can add in a little bit more gour gum but this time you're not going to add it directly into the pot just get your bowl that your butter was in there's enough oil in there to deal with it and we're just gonna take a little bit like about an eighth of a teaspoon and you stir it into the oil into the butter it dissolves the gore gum as otherwise as i said if you just dump that in now it'll just lump up once it's dissolved into there just add it in like soup and whisk it again again have a look so here i've got some air bubbles we have a little bit of other gelatin broken a little bit but nowhere near like when we use the um the uh pan blender much nicer so now that we have this as our base here now is when we can add our flavors and our color so this said i wanted to do lemon raspberry so i'm going to split this off to half about right so for this side i'm going to add just a little bit more lemon and to this side i'm going to add in our raspberry it's probably a little too much raspberry and we're going to add in our colors so i'm going to keep the yellow which one do i want to keep clear i think i'll keep the yellow clear and i'm going to make the red solid so as i said if you've got the white um food coloring you have to shake it up really really well if it sits on the sits in your cover it has a tendency to separate so you really want to mix it well otherwise it leaves little white dots so that might be a little too much it's always let's do a couple drops a little heavy handed and i'm going to whisk this one together oh these red food coloring that's a pretty color now because i'm pretty sure i've added too much white like i said i only got to add in one or two drops because i kind of went a little heavy-handed likely this red isn't going to set but what i'm going to do is i'm going to quick test it i'm going to put a little bit into a i'm just going to put a little bit into a into a dish i'm going to throw this into the fridge for a couple of minutes to see if it sets up if it doesn't i'm going to add some additional gelatin to that side all right so my little test here it it's setting up that was just a couple minutes in the fridge we're setting no problem now if you'd done that and it was still sticky sticking to your finger then you would want to add about a half a tablespoon of additional unflavored bloom gelatin so you would bloom a half a tablespoon to three tablespoons of cold cold water and add it to that to the solid side but we're good and i went ahead and i added my yellow to my yellow side here and now what i'm going to just do is i'm going to let them sit for just a couple of minutes and allow the air bubbles to come up to the top and that white icky stiff stuff to come and we can pull that out before we pour it into our bottles so our syrup now has been sit and set for a little bit and it's cooled off and you can see kind of that layer on top here take your strainer and just very gently scoop that out so this is the kind of the air bubble a little bit of the broken gelatin but we can get a lot of that out before we put it in the bottle and then with your strainer and you just want to hold it over the bottle and pour your syrup into the bottle dead on on that one not bad and now we're ready to cast our candies so a tip for you put your molds into your freezer before you start that way they're nice and cold and your gelatin your syrup will start to solidify right away especially if you're doing two colors that way they won't all bleed together another tip for you before you pour turn your bottles upside down put your fingers over the tips and just tap them what this will do is bring all the air bubbles to the top or to the bottom of the bottles so again helps make it much nicer candy okay then and then just fill up your molds now one thing important with your molds is don't fill them all the way to the top you want to go just just below it go all the way to the top it creates a ridge that gets icky it gets hard these are guys you're gonna look so cool yellow on yellow is tough it's hard to see it especially when it's clear so this recipe will make about um about a hundred or so of this size mold that i'm using probably about 300 of the teeny tiny and probably about 60 50 60 of the larger size all right so my gummies have set get your cooling rack your drying wrap parchment paper design your rock [Applause] and just pop out your gummies now if you can stand them up if they'll stand up better but if not just lay them down and then after about 12 hours flip them and let them fully dry out i usually flip them a couple times a day i walk by and do my flip and these guys will take about 24 to 48 hours to fully dry out and you want to make sure that you have a dry place humidity will not help your candies dry out at all drying and humid do not work together so if you do have a human place um if you can get a dehumidifier that will greatly help you out so i'm just going to finish uncasting these little guys and i'm going to go into the next step and show you the little trick with the alcohol and what that does and then how to successfully uh sugar sour coats your candies so be sure to stay tuned so this is the size of the candies when you take them out of the mold and that's the size of the candies once they dry so they shrink there a little bit there all right so here's a trick that i learned a tip that i learned and um it's gonna make your lives a whole lot easier especially for those of you guys who ship and we're having troubles with your candy sticking together what you're going to do is you're going to take your everclear or your um everclear or alcohol depending on where you're from anywhere you're 94 or up percentage alcohol put it into a small spray bottle remember the equipment that i always forget to tell you small spray bottle was one of them so put your alcohol into a small spray bottle so we want to give our candies a bit of a generous spray here and then just mix them up let the alcohol get into all candy all over and again if you can do this with tincture if you've got your tincture provided you did it with the uh the high grade alcohol and once you do that just put them out rip them up and let the alcohol evaporate it takes about 20 minutes or so and that's it it creates um kind of creates a bit of a barrier it keeps your candies um chewier for a longer period of time so i've had these guys out for about four days and see they're still perfectly squishy and gummy and not dried out looking or anything and that's what the alcohol helps to do and it also prevents them from sticking together all right so the next part is how to successfully sugar coat your gummies all right so this is the really other cool thing that i learned how to successfully coat our candies so for the most part you take them out you coated them they melt it it gets ugly we're not happy because that's because we're doing it wrong well the reason is and citric acid as i said is an acid if there is any moisture it is going to cause it to uh to melt so that's what's happening is you take your candies out of the fridge it's warmer outside of your fridge you know room temperature it automatically creates moisture from cold to warm or if you just automatically put your candies in or there's any moisture it the strict acid will melt so in order to successfully coat them so they don't what you want to do is once your candies have fully dried after a couple of days and if you do the step with the alcohol coating and they're done take your candies take a drying rack and just spread them out onto the drying rack then you're going to get your pot of boiling water here and we're going to just hold the rack over the steam just move it around so our candy's getting cut getting steamed up here and we don't burn our hands so what we're doing here is we're creating them we're giving them a little bit of a heat steam melt to create a bit of tackiness and then our candies stick and they don't melt so once they feel kind of gooey a little bit gooey there it doesn't take very long just dump them into your sugar your sugar mix now for the most part you do about a cup of sugar to a quarter teaspoon or so of the citric acid and then taste that these guys didn't get steamed and give that a taste and see how you like it then just add a little bit at a time until you get the desired sourness that you would like or you can just sugar coat them you don't have to do the sour so once they're done you put them in the bowl mix them all up get your wrap parchment paper i don't have enough room ah i so need a bigger table then just shake off your excess and if there's any ones that didn't get coated just hold them over the steam and that's it onto the rack they're pretty much ready to go they take about 20 minutes to dry fully dry out and that's it you will have your sugar coating that will not melt and there you have them nicely coated sugar sour coated uh gummies that aren't going to melt on you all right guys so that's everything i have for you today i hope you enjoyed that video even though it was a do-over but good so is you did get to learn a couple of new things and that should greatly improve your candies all right so and once again thank you so much for joining me today and i hope you have an awesome rest of your day bye", "3l_Y2rxWxP4": "hey it says Chris with CBD and former today I'm going to do a CBD MD review for you and go over some of their products I have a bunch of them in front of me right now we're going to talk a little bit about I want to put the link to their website directly under this video in a description box along with a 15% off coupon code so if you do decide to try out their products be sure to use that and save yourself some extra money so CBD MV is one of those few companies of CBD products that I actually use my wife and I for different reasons we've tried many many different brands of CBD products from ones you've never heard of too many that just send us samples to do reviews on a lot of the products seem to work good some work very good and others we haven't seen that get much of an effect from at all including having a really bad taste now when I compare CBD MD to all these other companies I would have to put them absolutely at the top for several reasons number one they are one of the most affordable CBD products their products are very pure very high quality they're made in the United States they have a money-back guarantee and also they taste very good and when you compare that with a lot of the other companies that we've tried that are expensive that we have not had very good results with and that can just taste absolutely horrible CBD MD is absolutely my favorite and their fav or my favorite product that they have is the CBD gummies now I have the 300 milligrams I also have the 750 milligrams which is almost empty so I'm going to be starting on this one the difference between the two is that in the 300 milligrams you're only getting 10 milligrams of CBD per gummy whereas in the 750 milligrams bottle you're getting 25 milligrams per gummy so there is a big difference just depending on what you're wanting to use the product for now most of the time you're going to use these for two reasons one is for helping to relieve pain and anxiety and the other is to help you to relax or sleep better now some of these products have a lot more CBD in them than others which makes them more beneficial for dealing with the more serious issues for example we have the CBD oil that comes in 3,000 milligrams the stuffs really potent I do recommend being cautious with how much you take if you order the larger quantities of the CBD oil this one here is berry flavored and the flavors that they have for these are very very good there are light flavorings to cover up that slight earthly taste you get from CBD oils but it's enough to really give it a taste that you can enjoy while taking the oils and these are pure oils unlike many companies have a lot of different additives to it to dilute it and kind of make it less effective CBD mvs is very pure very high quality and it does work very well so this here is the 3,000 milligrams CBD oil and we also have the 750 milligrams CBD oil and we have the 1500 milligrams CBD oil this one here is mint flavored and the mint is also very good and then the other two that I had were berry now they also have a vaping oil this is vanilla flavored I do not vape so I cannot tell you what this tastes like I can tell you that it smells very good it just has a light vanilla smell to it so the other thing my wife really likes are the CVD indie bath bombs which are these right here which have 100 milligrams of CBD and they smell very very good open up one they all have these little packets in it that has a little bit of information in them and then we're going to have a little bath bomb about this size and they do smell really really good they also have the capsules these are 1,500 milligrams total which equals out to 50 milligrams per capsule which is a very good starting point for CBD especially if you're dealing with things that are a little bit more moderate not quite to the point to where they're severe this is probably a good place to start with that but these are just CBD that's the only thing that's in them the only well actually there's the in MCT oil also which is extracted from coconut oil but that's all that's in those and then lastly we have the CBD India revive which is a lightweight hydration lotion and I've used this several times it has organic coconut oil win at CBD grapeseed oil it's really good for a hydration type lotion that you can use on sore muscles but I haven't really seen much of an effect for this I've tried a lot of other companies lotions and creams too and I don't get much of an effect from the lotions or the creams what seems to work best for me is the oils or the tinctures and the CBD gummies those are the ones that seems to work best for me so overall CBD MD and my opinion is a great company very very high quality products especially at the price that they offer them at and then on top of that you can use the link under this video and that coupon code to save an additional 15% on your order and there's a money-back guarantee so if you're not happy with it you know no hard feelings you can send them back but I think overall you guys are really going to enjoy these products as much as I have especially the gummies and the oils so that's my review of CBD MD I hope you guys enjoyed it if you did please feel free to subscribe to my channel like this video I plan on doing a lot more videos of other CBD companies that I have in products that I'm going to be testing and using in the future thanks and have a great day", "UAAP63-HtKI": "hey what's good everybody j ping here respect my region just wanted to tap in and make a

proceed to the recent video hey guys I'm back with another video so basically this video is gonna be different it's gonna be a product review for something that I've been meaning to try I was kind of not really worried but I did a lot of research on it and this is just something that I've been meaning to try hopefully bringing you in my video you in my video okay I like I was saying before um this product is something that I've been meaning to try and so yeah as you guys know I deal with anxiety and depression and haven't really been sleeping and part of it is because of my anxiety and depression and so I was asking my Twitter followers like what else I could do to basically do because I'm always irritated I work with kids so it just makes it 10 times worse to the point where I like don't go to work because I know I'm gonna be irritated I just need something to mellow me down but that was legal I do not smoke weed I don't smoke cigarettes I don't smoke anything I don't like the way it smells I'm like when smoke gets into my hair so smoking weed was just out of the question there's nothing against people who smoke weed I just don't so one of my followers recommended CBD oil or CBD gummies or whatever so like hmm ok [ __ ] so I did look it up and research it basically it comes from like a cannabis cannabis plant but it's not marijuana basically whatever is in like we'd like the THC that's not in these gummies but it still kind of gives you the same effect maybe just not as high that's how I understood it but basically it's like gummies without the legal stuff in it but it still gives you kind of the same effect so the gummies that I picked up from Amazon where these hemp gummies excuse me on these hemp gummies they are 30 thousand million in each gummybear has 250 milligrams of him ashtray in each one and it comes with a total of 120 these were well I was this video was all over the place these were $24.99 I think on Amazon and they got here literally within two days so wow yeah I literally ordered these yesterday and they got here today so real quick I'm opening for you so that you guys can see them so yes I'm excited to try these make mostly because of for my anxiety and my depression and also it's like asleep there very soon um only thing that I'm not sure about is if you take a drug test if it will show up my director I did a lot of research and they say that it waited because it doesn't have THC in it but I mean I don't know you might want to try that yourself I was trying to look for a drug test my story to take so that I can let you guys know or not they smell like sorry guys I checked but I can't find one so yeah it's up to you teacher them you know used to your discretion thank smell like organic coming berries I know if you ever had like gummies like health gummies and they smell like a whole bunch of fruits and vegetables mixed up together that's what they smell like I also want to note that whenever you do search CBD or gummies on Amazon all of these hemp oil products are gonna come up I read somewhere that Amazon can't sell CBD oil products I don't know if they're just disguising it as hemp oil or if it's really just hemp oh but just also pay attention to that whenever you do order they're like the meaning of evaders so it stays for the take to the day like one in the morning one at night but since I just got these imma go ahead and just take two I see what happens so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take them so I'm gonna take a green and a red one for Christmas and then I'm gonna come back 30 minutes later and let you know that it's a snake burglar coming beers already come back okay so real quick why I'm 20 sorry for smacking the ingredients say if they have him pimp extract him or omega three six and nine vitamin E and vitamin B other ingredients include corn syrup sugar water and gelatin citric acid natural and artificial flavors Connor Bo carnem hmm some plant leaf wax oh the other number five and number six red number forty and blue number one so yeah great taste so far I took two so that was 500 milligrams that I just took today so I'm gonna be back and let you guys know how I'm feeling hey guys so real quick I wanted to come back and come back come back and give you all an update on the gummies I know set up on come back 30 minutes later but I actually kind of decided to just maybe sleep on it and see how I sleep to give you guys a better review because honestly didn't feel anything which is kind of a good thing there's no side effects of the gummies I slept fine I took something this morning I've been very active I Oh actually after I took me I cleaned my room okay my bathroom today I went out and ran errands actually got off the bed I woke up early too so it's definitely giving me energy um I'm not really sad at the same time I also got paid so I might one during the review and I'm broke just being honest but so far so good I'm just happy there's no side effects of it I don't feel high I don't feel woozy I just feel happy like I generally have like no nothing back to say about it I don't feel angry or sad and oh so funny so last night I was looking for shoe this is really awkward a random story but I was looking first shoe last night and I found myself like getting angry but then I was just like like I got mad for like they're like five seconds I was like you know what I can't give that other things I can't control like stop getting mad over things retain control so I just you know brushed it off took a deep breath brushed it off can't clean in my room and then something told me to look in a certain spot it was an awkward spot a spot where a shoe should not be in and that's where my other shoe was and it's so funny because I feel like I don't know if I've ever told you this but I think I'm kind of psychic and I feel like these gummi bears opening my third eye a little bit and maybe tapping to my psychic abilities because the way I found that shoe yesterday there was no way to be God so I don't know that's just my experience with a gun me so far so good no complaints I would definitely recommend them if you feel like you need something and even if it's just all in my head and they really don't work I'm just happy I don't feel a high I don't feel a buzz I don't feel sleepy none of that I got slept great last night they're just good I liked them so far so if you're interested in them I'll link them down below thank you guys for watching until next time bye guys", "YT5GRLadfKU": "hey what's up everybody i was recently making a list of over-the-counter products that can help you decrease anxiety and stress and i ran into hemp gummies while i was browsing on amazon i was really impressed with the reviews that i saw it was not easy selecting a bottle as there are plenty of bottles with good reviews and some very confusing numbers on the label you'll see big numbers such as 400 000 all the way up to 1 million that i've seen recently and i had no idea what that meant a lot of these are also marketed the same way they have big numbers in the front unclear nutritional information on the back lots of health claims and happy people and photos with lots of lighting the bottle that i purchased was based on the reviews not based on just the highest number on the bottle if the bottle does not list the milligrams per gummy divide the total number in the front on this bottle it's 240 000 by the number of gummies 60. so that's 4 000 milligrams of what hemp oil also known as hemp extract on the bottle so here was my experience i initially took two gummies per day the first couple of weeks then after that i took about four per day i was curious because the claims were stress relief reduced inflammation improve sleep reduce anxiety reduce depression so they have a strong gummy bear smell with something else that i can't really identify the texture is softer than your typical gummy bear so initially they taste just like your regular gummy bear then there's another flavor behind it and i can't really identify it i had a headache the first day that i took one so i figured hey this is a perfect opportunity the headache really didn't go away i wasn't subjected to like a lot of stress so i can't speak to that on the first day nothing noticeable around the first try it did not change any anxiety ticks that i have it did not make me sleepy i was reading the news like always before i went to sleep so really there was nothing noticeable the first days other than eating a delicious gummy a month later i was reflecting upon any benefits because initially i didn't feel any and it seems to help with arthritis i have wrist arthritis right where my thumb meets the wrist and i suffered less during the month that i was taking them but the effects were not immediate it just took some time with regards to anxiety and depression i found the results negligible like a drop in the bucket kind of experience so i was curious about why these hemp gummies are so popular let's talk about cannabis a little bit so there are over 150 identified cannabinoids in cannabis with thc and cbd being the most popular so thc will give you that high and the cbd gives you the calming effects so let me clarify amazon does not sell cbd products so no these gummies don't contain cbd and they obviously don't contain thc but some people thought they did in the reviews the association with cannabis plant may be what brings customers to this product so let's talk hemp so hemp is a specific strain of the cannabis plant hemp is high in cbd but it is very low in thc i believe american grown ham has less than point zero two percent thc but the cbd is mainly found in the leaves and the flowering of the hemp plant but there is no cbd in the hemp seed which is what these gummies are made from so if the gummies don't contain cbd or thc then what are you getting so let's look at hemp seed oil about 75 percent of hemp seed oil is composed of omega fatty acids the rest is a monounsaturated and saturated fats about 50 percent of the hemp seed oil is omega-6 fatty acids more specifically linolenic acid about 17 is omega-3 fatty acids more specifically alpha linolenic acid i also noticed that this composition is very similar to flax seed oil so any benefits that people are talking about in the reviews is from omega fatty acids so i was curious and i did a search for omega 3 6 and 9 products and sure enough the reviews were aligned with the hemp gummy reviews yeah improved memory healthier skin lower cholesterol improved immune system reduce arthritis pain less anxiety essentially the hemp gummies are a cannabis-derived source of omega-3 and six fatty acids would i buy these again no for each of the benefits that are cited in the reviews there are actually other supplements that do a better job of addressing these issues that's for another video did i waste my time on this no from this experience i read up more on omega fatty acids and i found that omega-3 works great at reducing arthritis pain but the best source of omega-3 is fish oil so thanks to this hemp gummy i'm currently taking omega-3 fish oil that's a wrap if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below i always add more information in the description of the video thanks for watching", "22d-5c-2Cxk": "I'm excited to be here and we're gonna record this in a minute but we didn't allow that like a little trial and error making sure everything's working right

educate talk about reviews and different products that we have here and so those of you who are here thank you all so much for supporting us and just being a force of change being a positive feedback for us because without you we wouldn't be who we are so then you are also my god before we get started can you give people a little bit more of your background because I know a lot people owe me more yeah let me do that I still gotta get used to looking straight at the camera and all this being on film stuff so it's a little all right I'll stare into the camera so my name is Mike my background is I've worked for about 10 years in the health and supplement industry I've also was a sales trainer for a national automotive manufacturer I worked as a federal agent was on the US Attorney's Healthcare task force out here where I'm located you know now I'm into the helping people the natural healing I've seen a lot of vets a lot of first responders a lot of people seniors just every condition you can imagine needing help and just tired of using traditional pharmaceuticals and a couple years back I got into more the cannabinoid part of the industry researching that learning about that that's kind of where we stand right now I'll go into more details later about some more specifics but that's just a general overview so what do you take what do you take CBD for me I take it for neuropathy carpal tunnel back issues not so much like anxiety and stuff like that more physical physical ailments things that have inflammation so and just overall general health like to boost my inda cannabinoid system like how we kind of take stuff for our immune system to keep that strong we need to keep our tender cannabinoid system strong and so I take it daily for that usually between fifty and a hundred milligrams for me just because I have a lot of inflammation and like physical permanent injuries so I take a little bit more than the average person but you know it works in all dosages so yes and for me my first time taking in CBD was for pain in my wrist I have tore ligaments and now I have arthritis on my right hand from military injuries I have a cyst on my left hand I have no nerve damage of my fingers so I was in pain here and I have two arguments in my left hand and when I first started taking it he helped so much with the pain but the biggest benefits that I wasn't expected is he helped me with my anxiety and my depression and a lot of it had to do with not just the fact that I never say fixes my anxiety depression but it allowed me to really go after my dreams which is just to be a educator and help people and through the process of adding on things like eating better and meditation I was able to live a better life which I'm currently doing now so those of you who are watching we always want to tell you that don't think of CBS a cure but as a tool to use to help you become better because take a CD alone is just like taking a pill and not taking care your body isn't gonna help you rawrr become healthier so you want a couple it will even right you know after your mental state is watch watching TV and the people who you are around so this is just a little bit about us and learn more by going to CBD down how WWDC be how for all things education base so today I'm excited to be talking about a few products I know I have a vape from Cindy line which is a distillate it's 500 milligrams of CBD and I also have a symptom bomb from Green health um naturals and so they started experimenting with the full spectrum line and I'm grateful that I was able to try it out on the website they have a thousand milligrams so I get started on this and there might be just go back and forth is that cool with you okay absolutely alright so let's start with the bomb so I'm gonna paint a lot my joint so like I said I have austerity which is just chronic pain I have no cartilage in my wrist so it's just bone on bone grinding and that's what us your itis is and then on my left hand I have like I said I have a cyst and I have torn ligaments and then I have nerve damage in my fingers which I also had it on my right hand but I had three charges on here and so I don't really feel the nerve damage as bad I know that there's damage there but they cut the nerve so I use a lot of bombs and when it comes to review products one of the things I tell people is I don't want any samples because for me this light here will work wonderful I feel like a day or two from traveling but if I want to review a product and really test it properly I want something that could last for me a good couple weeks the same thing goes with dentures so this is why I always make sure that this stuff is empty you see it's gonna be using for over a month now in came handy when I traveled to New York and Maryland last last month so the thing I like about it compared to the current part which actually this is full-spectrum and it has a ton of benefits in here so I'm gonna give the ingredient real quick is beeswax coconut oil castor oil turmeric lavender wintergreen count for a peppermint yin-yang I'm up I'm center-right helichrysum blue tan G blue camomile better care fill in and just a bunch of other benefits in here so on the website the 1000 milligram for the foot comes in two lungs is $75 or $74.99 uses winterized full-spectrum CBD oil and it's just a bunch of turbines out here they have a really good CoA which has I'll give you a so CVG I see one point four four percent CBD is ninety four point seven six percentage for overall and the container CBN has point four ten there is one point nine percent of distribution of THC which is point zero seven I'm still under point three percent CBC is point zero six which is one point six seven percent distribution and so it's uh it's wonderful to see that this is actually a full-spectrum product now as far as mean when it comes to trying products that I like to rub it in aggressively especially when I'm in pain and for those of you who are in the cold weather climate knows that it's your pain affects more especially when you rain so it lasts normally for me anyway between two to four hours and it depends what I'm doing if I say Bevans stop doing anything then I could get it for about four five hours if I'm not doing anything at all but if I'm actually doing work anonymously anyway from about two hours an average and I might have to keep I planned it one thing I could do is add it on my ankles when I'm doing yoga in the morning and then before and after lists to help calm the inflammation and yeah this is where I'm now I don't have any problems with it you know it's a really good price per thousand milligrams compared to some of the others I see and I love the fact that I'm not a company I've been talking them for three years so I've been part of the process of helping them grow whenever they have a question Bevan um what do you recommend I always keep my feedback and this goes to anybody so any companies that ask me for my feedback I'm waddling open not just the Brenna said we trust but if you are new brand said hey Bevin them he please helped me do you have any idea and resources to help us I will gladly do it within reason but so I just just want to make sure that food transparency is here and this is one of the brands that I know I like to follow the journey because one of the things comes to killing with the owner he loves to go out in the community and mingle with veterans he's always just dropping by and if you see a veteran he will give him a bomb or in the sample of his CBD of tincture so Brian is really good and the brand is called green thumb Naturals and WWE green thumb Naturals calm and go onto the website to check it out any thoughts on this Oh Mike no I like your the formulation of it it didn't seem like camphor was the first ingredient or menthol or something that's gonna you know get on your fingers and and rubbing your eyes and later on a bunch of essential oils and herbs and stuff and it's a consistency more like a it's like a ball kind of like a thicker what's that it's more the greasy side so like when I rub it in my hand it's CBBC here he sees a little more greasy uh-huh which is fine yeah just fine it's compared to some of the others is fine I've tried some that had tumeric in them and they stain my clothes they stain my pillow on oh no we call it our couch so this one doesn't did it so I really like it even though it's a Monica Lee she said he works wonderful I like it I haven't any issues with it one thing I was gonna say too with the essential oils and creams essential oils tend to oxidize a lot that real essential oils oxidize when exposed to air and opening containers back and forth so a lot of times in your cream products or your bombs or your your stuff like that if they start to turn color brown to pink over time it's because of the oxidation of the essential oils it doesn't mean the products necessarily going bad so that sounds like a good product it seems a lot more natural not so synthetic Elia Rollag you might forget or Walmart or something that's nice oh I agree I agree so which one you which product you have to start with well I have three of the same category so today I'm gonna focus on like gummies or soft true type stuff so okay I'll just show you all three and then I'll talk about one at a time but what I'm gonna compare is one is I got to work on this lighting situation but it's called curly fro leave yep pro leave CBD and fuse gummies then we have a green green Rhodes CBD froggies kind of shaped like a frog and we have a wash Bach alchemy squid full spectrum have extract like a natural gummy type thing so I think first well what did I show you guys first the pro leave I'll start with this first um I'm sorry like so bad anyway I'm just gonna take a sample of each one to give you guys a feel for like taste this is just all my opinion everybody has different feelings on case but with the pro leave the main ingredients are organic glucose syrup and they do put parentheses or weak so people dunno if you have a celiac disorders almonds listed organic cane sugar pectin citric acid ascorbic acid natural flavours natural colours organic concentrate Apple organic carrot pumpkin and blackcurrant and industrial hemp so I mean there's a little bit of cane sugar and stuff but overall it's it seems to be a little bit healthier choice than a lot of them on the market I think this one is a 50 milligram so I just randomly picked they're kind of shaped just like a orange slice or like a loner stop so I'm just gonna sample course opinion asking the month of sugar per serving on this one sugars 2 grams nice not too high really you know this one you can definitely taste like the cane sugar put in a way if you're somebody who craves sugar this might not be a bad bad option no it has a good taste to it that has oh I was gonna mention it has the QR code when you scan it I believe on this one I test for heavy metals microbials mild toxins the whole gamut of stuff and it did test out you know I know exactly but it's very close to 50 so it was within compliance reasons for that it's a good case I would say it's a good compromise in between but he wants something sugary but a little bit more on the healthier side this would be this would be a good product to UM try I can't tell you necessarily on the effect because I haven't tried it for 30 days so I don't want to make you know tell you all this works great and blah blah blah but based on the lab tests and if your body responds you know for all the CBD I think it's gonna work good for you so it's just another alternative it's in between the market of high fructose corn syrup candies and completely vegan it's one it's on the healthier side but it's you know it's right in the middle I would say so and I think the price is roughly I could look it up but there's 50 milligrams per gummy I think it's around $60 for a 30-day supply or somewhere around there you can get more information I think it pro leave p ro le ve pro leave calm if you want to look at this stuff on that so so one quick aid came in is it full spectrum I said a broad spectrum this one is right here it will tell me I just want to make sure they completely right no THC it says on here and let's look at the ingredients one more time industrial hemp so we'd have to pull the lab tests right now oh they don't cannabidiol doesn't say this or that I'm not sure I was going more for the taste and like the ingredients today on these because there's three of them but that's one you could look up it does have the warning and does not contain more than 0.3% Delta 9 THC on it so that would give me the feeling that there might be a minor amount then on this side it says no THC so that may be one thing you want address on your labeling if you're if if you're working for that company if one thing says contains less does not contain more than 0.3% delta-9 and then your other picture says I gotta get a sled if there's no THC so yes probably be more labeled what it contains MIT's broad-spectrum full-spectrum or just cannabidiol by itself it doesn't say so I'm just gonna look at it from a standpoint if you pick that up in the store you wouldn't have the lab test right in front of you you may be a little confused so maybe fix the labeling a little bit on that that would help out the consumer so yeah it just says haven't arrived CVD or doesn't say anything I'm assuming it's gonna be severe isolate on there this is one of the things promised me I work with brands you're not specific enough when it comes to us on the product for me it's caused us a lot of misinformation and you wrote to trust the community we need not be more open to the ingredients right and I just kind of want to focus like we're just today and some of the reviews we've done before and then the future will do you know more in-depth I kind of wanted to look at these two days like I pulled it off the shelf and here's ingredients and you know this is what the consumer would see off the top of their head so knowing yeah it was a big score or a deeper item I must have right now no we are we have a website a platform for reviews where we region the actual brand itself and there's gonna be on but we still testing it now has a rating system if you want to go right now look at it simply that how slash reviews we were launching that over the next couple weeks so that will we have where you can leave your comments on the company and the plan is to have so for example right now we have Dutch natural and tonic so Dutch natural is a company and then on the day we will be add an individual products as time goes on but like I said again this is something that's to take time because our team is very small a lot of these things we do is just opening it freely and so we have to manage our time appropriately when it comes to pushing out the content and so as we slowly develop the team and able to create the systems in place we'll be able to that populate is as fast as possible now if some of you who are interested in reviewing or have me reviewing products and you'd like to contribute to to us towards the reviews will be gladly open to that and build some SAP type of system where you can be part of this and help us educate the community properly so just you know this is this lab is the first of many for us we still try to make sure that all the kinks out here and so we thank you so much for the support that you've given us and just being asking the questions and so thank you so much okay so I think as we're just getting started on this and just getting the new platforms and trying out the technologies and stuff if you guys have suggestions on how you want the products rated for the future like a 1 through 10 scale or certain criteria or stuff like that we'd love to hear that because we're here to help you sure we can make our own and this and that but what do you guys want to see how do you want it rated if you want to comment on the Instagram accounts that CBD dot how or at great CBD reviews or send a message over we'll take all that into consideration because we're here for you you know as the consumer so whatever you would like to see if there's enough people want it rate it that way then you know we'll take that into consideration all right so let's do stick to them the other I'm gonna go so let's try to perform what do you think of it from you got me I don't know but I have two flavors so here's what they here's one CBD froggy 50 milligrams green roads this one is I'm guessing like a lemon it doesn't really say oh no it just it's yellow this one is purple so I'm assuming that's great it doesn't say just as omnigul these are again self-serve you know one time use pack so like again I can't give you a 30-day evaluation how the product works when you only have single serving packs you I'm not gonna tell you as effective or not because I can't make that decision so um the the gummy so if you guys comment Bevan if you can tell me which one they want me to eat or if you want you to eat one or the other I don't care but let me give you the ingredient which one the great one to try to grip on to me think about it okay let me read you the ingredients first before I try it I don't know this just on the packaging - they have a QR code I scanned that one this morning it had all the all the proper testing done on and it met within criterion for the 50 milligrams like the ingredients are this one's a little sweeter corn syrup sugar gelatin citric acid natural and artificial flavors FD&C red number forty yellow number six yellow number five blue number one then 50 milligrams of phyto cannabinoid rich oil parenthesis PCR it may cause drowsiness and not recommended if pregnant or breastfeeding so it's also made in the USA by green ropes so let me have break this bad boy open it says MD THC so that would mean like not detectable or none detected THC um a lot of people won't even know what that nd means so again on your labeling these companies need to be a little more specific about exactly what they're using I get what they're trying to do not mention certain things but if you call your product CBD froggy you might just want to list the kind of CBD New Jersey so here we go he tried that Colet you know that is isolate product and I could tell you compared to some of the others that I would never personally wouldn't pick this one over others out the first one is so much better for us when it comes to the quality of it and the sugar here is 9 grams of sugar okay it is it is a lot bigger than the other it's like 2 to 3 times as big as the other piece so it's a bigger piece that's probably why but let me put this frog in my mouth kind of a big frog in my throat soon so mom magazine that so he has zero cholesterol is no sodium here 11 grams of carbs 1 gram of protein it's actually picked to calorie fat in the calories so one of the problems I have with the frog is is that he has artificial ingredients it's FD&C red 40 yellow 6 yellow 5 blue one and like when it comes to gummies love you know having something is more organic at least as close to possible so much better I like your natural stuff is just just stuff added that doesn't really help your body you know is it a still a broad spectrum because the Webster says when you look at the lab reports that blonde puts on a show CBI slip I'm just CBL is not a Miami noise in there so what is isolate more spectrum all I can say good baseball the lab reports is only showing CB Iceland oh yeah that makes sense where it says uh hold on non detected THC so there we go um taste-wise it's not as sweet as the pro league one I thought to be a little bit sweeter with those ingredients like corn syrup and stuff but it's um actually is more of a ahem flavor to it kind of weird I agree with you on the ingredients i i'm the human guinea pig here today so i don't like putting all these um colorings into me I don't know why we I guess when you use the color spectrum wheel that made purple yellow five yellow six red forty blue one mix them together and you got a art project here looks like a frog but it uh I don't know ingredients you're right I I personally probably wouldn't choose this I would say at this point the prob'ly taste a little bit sweeter and is a healthier alternative but you know if you're on the go and you're you love frogs or if you have a friend who loves frogs or even I don't know I don't know what the point of the Frog is honestly maybe it was their favorite pet as a kid I but anyway that's the CBD froggy I think they make other CBD creatures and things they make a ton of products but uh it's full of too many synthetics for my liking so I would say at this point pro leave is in the lead as far as taste and ingredients so what do you what are your thoughts on that question Kim you know so we thought so no screaming so I've actually tried these and they're pretty good which flavor do you have so this one here is a Crisp Apple oh I have crisp apples so why don't we are you gonna eat yours today I'm gonna get it right okay let me grab one more flavor over here and you can tell me about that one I'll grab them so I've tried these in different flavors and compared to some of the other one allows you like these they have organic toffee tapioca syrup organic sugar water pectin apple flavor full spectrum hemp extract so this is a full spectrum citric acid coconut oil red cabbage color sort of using the cabbage for the coloring this one has tumeric in here and contains coconut one thing I like about it they have batch numbers on the back of it the little batch of ID so he got was calling verified information and then it has a 10 character no calories there's no sodium here 2 grams of carbs 0 fiber 2 grams of sugar and each of these have 20 milligrams in dosage not better it's pretty good you know just feeling it this one from the inside it feels a lot more on the other shoe were a little bit more of a solid feel like if you're familiar with like those orange slice candies or things like that is a little thing this feels a little more on jelly like probably because of you know the pectin and the another stuff so let me just I'm looking at it here same thing mine's just colored with red radish color but it has cap yoga organic organic tapioca organic sugar water pectin cherry flavor natural full-spectrum hemp extract so that's one thing they list listed full spectrum so you know what you're getting off the top of the package without having to scan the QR citric acid coconut oil and red radish color and they put the thing contains coconut the one thing I think is pretty and has the QR code on the back I'm sorry about the lighting guys we're gonna get that fixed by next time but has a QR code on the back and the one thing I do like that I recommend to companies is the labeling on here it's a label they stick on afterwards the pageant's printed with the main you know logo what the product is this and that but on the back the ingredients and that kind of stuff in the batch they're two separate stickers so if anything ever changes or laws change you can real able you can change you're not stuck with a million packaging that's pre-printed when you need to switch something up or if you change your formula you know you're still it's still gonna call it a squib but it may have another ingredients night you just pop on these new labels on the back of the package so that was a smart decision for that vegan now I don't see anything here that's not vegan right and they don't come and say but based on what I see for those of you want a big an option I think this is a good it's a good way to go and like I say this because so many greenness is close to counter prized around gummies and those are vegan so one of the thing that I can tell you I love about this is that I can taste the full spectrum like like I'm so used to yep it's pretty cool right so cute I'm so used to taking CBD now like so many products I've tried I'm taste out that taste of they have in there so compared to the isolate I could tell you this actually has full spectrum based on the taste and that's just my experience over the past four years of trying so many different products I'm kind of like used to knowing like you taste it there so if you want a product that doesn't have that taste in there this is not for it but it's not a over women as some of the others that we've tried so I really like the squibs and these are coming a ten to get it you get a ten ten each and it's a eight eighteen dollars for a pack of one that has a ten inside of there which is not bad which is not bad no III just case but you can definitely case the the hemp but in a way I personally like that because you know you're getting something in it you know you know you're tasting the ham so you know what's in them um it's not as sweet as the others but it has a much easier to chew consistency I believe because of the pectin in there the way it's formulated I believe it is a vegan product I know it doesn't say it on there but it yeah I'm I'm pretty sure you could classify this as vegan based off of the ingredients good taste again I'm not I'm not gonna comment on how well it worked because this is only 20 milligrams which I know is not enough to probably do anything with tomatoes taking CBD on a daily basis I'm not to not do anything but to feel like a spike or a big effect you know and again we only have like a single dose size so I can't tell you how well the it works in the long run but it tastes good and as I think the healthiest ingredients of everything we've done was this so my kind of comparison of them is that cool if I go over just the three yeah okay so I would say hmm health-wise best for your health in my opinion is a squib the consistency is good I like that you're getting 20 milligrams and you gave the pricing you know everybody can make their own determination is it worth a little bit higher price to have all natural ingredients in too many people it is a lot of people pay more for organic foods and things too so there's that so it's it no it's a good product um second in line I would go with this pro leave it's not as healthy the ingredients for the squid but it's a lot better than most of the companies out there with high fructose corn syrups and stuff like that and you think I'm talking to myself am I can you guys hear me let me look in chat this way write a comment if you can here hello there you are disappearance Arvelo all right so back to this the UH the probe we've you know it's a good compromise in between the two I'd still say it's super it's pretty healthy looking at the ingredients I am so happy they actually took the time to label and um I haven't seen this in lolly glucose syrup they put wheat a lot of people just put glucose fructose sucrose they don't put wheat like it's weird it's derived from so if you have celiac or weed disorders that's that's good to know you know so I would say next in line is the pro leaf it is 50 milligrams it's a better price per milligram for the CBD then these other two products you get almost twice as much CBD for the same a little bit more on the price some of them you're getting double the CBD so Pearlie visit I would recommend that product with this one as far as case ingredients and lab tests that reached out I think I'm the squib lab test I'm not sure can you pull that up quick by chance or did you have a chance to look at that I just want to make compare the lab test for the three because I can't pull it up at the same time I closes a lady trying not bland that case I'm just getting in my phone yeah just do like if you're a consumer whatever pops up because I know it's gonna go to their landing page hey I did do that I didn't Redux I didn't wanna I just wanted to remain out of the lab tests come sir the scripts and the websites like slow I'm having problems open to be labs from the thing okay got it what's his full spectrum so I just wanna you know it says on their labeling which I'm glad it says that it's not like just fight overage cannabinoid or this or that nice what are we looking for we're looking for square 20 milligram I think I have another warning okay what does it say as far as its positional full-spectrum and does it show like pesticides microbials my toxins all that renders so milligram per gram point four zero four percent of total THC six point two three eight milligrams of CBD there is some Doulton line here they know Delta eight there is a CBC so it's point two eight two percent CBC so all this CBC here CBD and Delta 9 THC all right so we got four factor of okay which is great to see that something lines up with what the label and says that's because sometimes we've seen that it tells them to yeah and there's no test foreign like McNamara talks to reduce almonds the corn to lab reports it doesn't have that just shows you the counterbored content which is the poor to see so and so I know maybe they did maybe they didn't list it but if I was alchemy or the squib line I would definitely with the price point that it's at I would include all those lab tests because you're you know a lot of people when they start paying more than twenty thirty bucks for a product they want to see all that all that stuff that you did and it shows your customer that you you care you tested everything my Oh toxins microbials like a full panel and you know it's not that expensive to do a full panel when you're producing stuff in bulk it's not gonna add much to your cost but it's labeled correctly that's awesome it has a good consistency I like it okay now here's the last one rush rush nella a pocket real quick Shimon to link to the lab so another one because the one from the label goes to a different one than the one that was sent to me here so that one has a test for pesticides in your that wasn't this that's better so there's a CB d here c BD v CB n CB g CB c delta-9 so it has more so this one must be full pull the full range of the one has all more than one just Swift and not individual size so we'll have to look at this for you go ahead got him Dion degree Rhodes oh yeah I should say that Swift has the batch ID Anna so I'm sure each batch is made up you know the different distillate from a different crop whatever so they'll be a little different but at least a list that batch ID which is nice I'm the Frog I thought with all the sugars and everything else it would taste a little more sweet almost like a candy you know but it really didn't I guess there's not a huge amount of sugar but when you look at the corn syrup and sugar is the two main ingredients you would think it tastes sweet so it doesn't taste that sweet it's it's a little large you know it's almost the size of like a baby frog you'd catch you know your hand is a kid and play with it it's there's a little too big I think you could cut the size down on it um for somebody the little mouth it might be a lot to chew might take him a little while you know health-wise the ingredients yes they're on the bottom of the list it's pretty much all synthetic artificial different colors this and that but if you hey if you're into frogs or something novelty or you like frog legs give it a try I mean go after the lab tests did turn out on that one there they're like a full panel - I think I'm this one um so they do do their laptop game but again it's different strokes for different folks if he had really loves to eat stuff you know I don't think any of them are gonna satisfy your sweet tooth on these three but I don't know do the watering when it comes to gummies I just like to remind people that gummies are kind of like candy so it tastes good you unit thinking you you in I've seen people eat a lot of these in one day think think in that case it's really good to taste like candy you know it's like some sweet that we grew up with so to be mindful these are CBD in there so you take Emily's once or twice a day at the most because once you take too much you $1 check she sugar to you but she causes inflammation and the fact that when you take too much CBD the body only used so much so whatever that young mother body needs it's gonna flush out your system so the last one we have right is this a single line got a disposable Bay Pam and so when I have it it's not available the website it's a new string so I've been trying it out when I went to Florida and also to Maryland it's really great it's a Maui wowie and it's 500 milligrams of a of CBD in a point 5 ml it's so Marwari comes from salon raised strains from Hawaii it some use reported effects for creativity energetic focus you get more earthy flowery tobacco flavors and it's a lot of a better care feeling in this dish strain here compared to some of the others and I really like it it tastes really good I wanna sleep an apple but I'm more like a sweet flavor to it and one thing I like about it there's no there's a peach in there there's no VG in there there's no MCT and that's we've seen a lot of other big companies have that unnecessary ingredients I just determined and distillate which is wonderful and on the cost of this right here here's $40 there are many different strains so there's blueberry forbidden fruit", "tFiPPb3WFG0": "hi well welcome to Diamond delight edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you're joining and if you're a regular subscriber welcome back thank you so much your support has been truly awesome so I had a couple requests there for vegan gummy bears and as I said it previously in the past I tried it with epic fail and so but I am never one to give up so I kept thinking about the method I knew would have just something to do with the method so I I thought I figured it out and the fact that you're seeing this video actually means that I did figure it out so I've created a vegan gummy candy for you so it's not gonna be exactly like a gummy bear but it's gonna be about as close and probably with you being vegan this is probably something that you're far more used to anyway and and with that yeah so I'm really excited to be able to bring that for it to you and the one thing I decided is if I'm ever gonna want to pick up somebody rich I'm gonna pick up a vegan because seriously man if they can afford the Google's groceries or that kind of food holy mountain they must have money because that stuff is expensive so anyway I'm gonna get into the ingredients here and the steps on how to do it and stay tuned alrighty so for our vegan can of oil gummies you're going to need well now I'm just making a small batch because I'm testing it so I'm not a hundred percent sure if this is gonna turn out and I really don't feel like wasting a whole bunch however if it does turn out you're if you're seeing the video then you know it's turned out so I'm going to be using 1 cup of juice I'm just using a peach cocktail you can use whatever juice that you'd like just not pineapple juice because it has an enzyme in it and that will that I know causes gelatin not to set I'm going to think it probably has the same effect on agar you're going to use one and a half tablespoons to one cup of the liquid if you want to make it more so if you're going to go 2 cups of liquid then you would do two and a half tablespoons of agar 3 cups of liquid three and a half a garb so on we're going to use one tablespoon of blue a gob syrup a quarter cup of our can of oil now I've just used regular coconut oil I haven't infused it because again I'm not going to eat this so I didn't really want to waste it and there's really no difference whether I've got THC in it or not and we're going to use Gore gum as our emulsifier so we're no further ado and we're gonna need our handy little blender and a saucepan and a spatula obviously your molds and that should be about it so I'm just gonna get this stuff cleared up and we'll get going alright so we're going to turn our heat on - so we're going to add our liquid to our saucepan and we're going to add in one tablespoon of the aghasura that's a coconut it was a lot different than butter so what we're gonna do is we're going to emulsify our our oil and our liquid first when I've tried it the other way adding everything into the agha R it just didn't work so I'm hoping that emulsifying our liquid and our oil together first is gonna solve that problem so I'm going to use 1/2 a teaspoon of our agar our sorry of our Gore gum Gorgo Mogar it's very tongue-twisting if you have a strainer like a little small strainer strainer works great for doing the gums so because you can evenly distribute it all over the top otherwise if you have to do it with your hands just try and do it as evenly as possible just kind of take little pinches and sprinkle it around like so and we're going to get our handy little hand wonder and start blending this up [Music] all right so that looks all thoroughly mixed so that looks good all our oil is nicely blended in so once you're that it's all nicely blended and it is all one uniform nice uniform homogeneous texture you're gonna add in one and a half tablespoons a Gaur now you can get Oh Garf lakes or agar powder the flakes are less expensive the powder I'm pretty sure you would use at the same but you'd have to look at the instructions for it I just don't have a hue a lot of experience with us with it and a half a tablespoon is one and a half teaspoons three teaspoons is one tablespoon and you're going to turn your heat up to medium-high we're going to bring this to a boil and once it's boiling we're going to turn it down and let it simmer for five minutes so now that my mixture is coming to a boil I'm going to turn it down to medium medium-low and just let that simmer for five minutes or until it is completely dissolved and you just want to keep make sure to keep stirring that alright so I'm kind of seeing some oil the oil sitting on the top here so I'm going to use the blender here to see if we can get that mixed in there because that's not looking quite right [Music] so I'm still seeing it set up at the top here the oil on the top so I'm gonna add in some more I'm gonna add a little more girl gum so I'm going to add in just a quarter of a teaspoon this time [Music] well that looks a lot better all right so what we're going to do now is distribute this in to our moles so whether you're using your squirt bottles this might be a little bit thick for the for an eyedropper but you can give it a try all right so once your your syrup looks like this it's nice and smooth no lumps you can put it into your squirt bottle oops oh [ __ ] all right don't do that on the mold learn from my mistakes all right so I'm just gonna clean up that bottle we'll get this into molds all righty so now that I've cleaned up my mess now the bottle is going to be very hot so you want to wrap it either in a some doubled up paper towel or use an oven mitt or something and you're just going to distribute it into your molds now don't fill your molds all the way up to the top like I just did there that's an oops you want to keep them just below and that's so it doesn't create an edge a sharp edge on your candies now with agar you're just gonna leave these sit on the counter for a few hours for them to set they do not go in the refrigerator whatever you do a guard is not set in the fridge it is completely different than gelatin also has a very different texture well if you're vegan and you you use agar you know what the texture is like but for those of you too new to it are trying it something different it is a different completely different texture than gelatin I can't really describe it it is a gelatin but it's not jello it's filling these up and I'll come back in a couple of hours we'll take them out and see what happens right so let's see how these little puppies came out well they come out of the mold really holy mackerel they actually worked this time I can't believe it last time they were partially set and partially mushy and they were really disgusting but this this method actually worked so I did some reading on how you actually store these because you can't do them like a regular gummy bear or a regular gummy candy and with four agar actually it says but it's served best cold so actually once they're all set you know just put them on a plate put them in the fridge for a couple of for about an hour George's for them to cool down get cold and then give them a try so I'm gonna do that and we'll see how they are now these puppies just pop right out of the mold look at that lot easier than the jello look bear overboard alrighty so I put these guys into the fridge for an hour and so they're nice and cold and you can see how much they lighten up and as well they're not as greasy so when you first take these guys out they are gonna feel a little bit greasy once you put them in the fridge that tends that goes away but as I said you can probably see you store them in the fridge I'll just wrap them up in wrap it up with saran wrap and they'll probably be good for about two weeks I'm gonna guess if you find that different please let me know in the comments that would be great alright so that is the little tutorial there on a vegan can of oil gummy bears and I'll just be back to say goodbye so that was my little demonstration there on vegan and can of oil gummy candies I hope you enjoyed the demonstration if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to put them in the comments I will get back to you as soon as I can and I'd love to hear from you and let me know how yours turned out alright well thank you so much for watching I really appreciate it and if you enjoyed this video I do hope you subscribe thanks again have an awesome day [Music]", "dO7VuHMBPhI": "[Music] what's up everybody my name is sarah b and welcome back to the haze today we're going to be doing another edible review we are going to be reviewing the very well known but new to me wild edibles so let's talk a little bit about wild in general they are a portland-based edible company and they specialize in using things that remind them of the pacific northwest and what makes it special and using those ingredients and those fruits and other items found in nature to make these awesome little gummies now in this box there is a hundred milligrams and there are ten small gummies i also want to just talk about real quick how the packaging is it is so cool so you open it like this and out comes this little pocket super easy to open you just squeeze on the side like this bam pop open and you will find these small little sugar coated gummies these gummies are made all with natural flavoring i absolutely loved these edibles they are not overly sugary at all which is fantastic they taste like a natural gummy something that you will find like in a trader joe's or something like that i started out with 40 milligrams and it hit it hit good too i loved it i wasn't overly i didn't feel dumb which some edibles can make someone feel dumb i didn't feel dumb i didn't feel like falling asleep was just so awesome i've been finding too many edibles lately that make you just want to pass out and these guys kept me up kept me going and once the high kind of wear it off and the after effects kind of left i still was able to have a great functioning day which is really nice i love the artwork that will did i love these little huckleberry flowers you'll see all over it and i believe every box looks a little different it goes with whatever the flavoring is which is really awesome on the inside it gives a little message and i'll read that for you the edible contains hybrid perfect for preparing for life's adventure it's a little like the perfect balance of wearing pajamas to work i just really appreciate the the thought process that went into the packaging and making of these edibles now i believe these guys are the number one selling edible in all of oregon and it makes sense they're based in portland but i found them also all over california they are a little bit more expensive than your normal edible but they are extremely consistent some edibles are really great one bag and they can taste great they'll be just like mind-blowing you can give a bag to your friend next thing you know they say it never hits them i don't believe this will be a problem with these guys i'd say if you if you were going to be hanging out at the house like all of us are right now but you're going to be studying maybe doing something for work i'd say eat one of these little guys and you're going to be chilling you'll be chilling you'll be chilling hard yeah so if you guys see these little edibles anywhere i would say pick it up you will not be making a mistake i promise you all right guys so that will be it for my small little review again my name is sarah b thank you guys so much for tuning back into the haze if you like this video please hit that like

eat a murder one a nerd [Music] you take a certain time [Music] hmm", "Ur6nBVrs800": "they look so cute don't they so good hi guys welcome back today i'm going to show you how to make sugar-free gummy bears with coconut oil for these sugar-free gummy bears the ingredients you're going to need is your coconut oil the gelatin something to flavor your gummies so these are just those sugar-free flavoring packets that you put into your water these ones i have are kool-aid sour green apple and i'm also going to make some of them with some sugar-free crystal white lemonade so you can use these flavor packets of any kind that you like or you can also use these type of sugar-free water enhancers whatever you'd like to flavor it will work i have some citric acid because i want mine to be sour again you don't really need citric acid but if you do want to be sour this is how you'll do it if you don't have citric acid and you still want them to be sour you can crush up vitamin c tablets um which will really give the same effect i have some spray which i'm going to use for my molds and soy lechen which i have in capsules like this but you can use the liquid version that would be better so you can do soy election or you can do sunflower election um ideally you want to do the liquid one not the pills because i'm going to have to break these open to put them in um the liquid one on amazon was just like kind of expensive to deliver to canada so i just went with these so you need these to keep the coconut oil from separating um from the gelatin and water mixture and then if you don't want to store them in the fridge and you want to be shelf stable so you can just keep them in your drawer in your pocket or wherever and they can last for months you're going to need a preservative this is a potassium sorbate mixture it's very very simple to make i will post a link below on how to make this all right our first step is to bloom the gelatin so this is very important to make sure that your gummies have a proper texture um so we're going to do this first before we do anything else because we have to let the gelatin sit so we need half a cup of water so you're going to want a larger dish for this if you have it in a smaller dish the surface area of the water will be a lot smaller so it won't be as effective so you could use a pyrex dish or anything that's like a little bit bigger than the average bowl so we're going to put our half cup of water in here and then i'm going to sprinkle three packages of gelatin or if you're not using the packages you could use like two and a half tablespoons of gelatin so i'm trying them now after they've sat for a bit and i feel like because it's hot in here and it's summer and the last time i made these it was winter so it's a lot colder i think i would use a little bit more gelatin so maybe like add an extra package or um another tablespoon just in case it's hot where you live um so that it doesn't so that it stays like fully hard enough it still does look fine like this though but if it's really hot in here it might melt a bit so good so you just want to sprinkle these over the water so you're getting as much surface area as you can some of it will overlap and that's okay and we're just going to leave this to sit for about five minutes no stirring just leave it as is so while this is sitting and blooming we're going to add a couple more ingredients to it um we're just going to put them directly on top they don't need to be stirred in just yet we'll just get it prepared for when we're ready so the first thing is our potassium sorbate mixture we're going to do 1 8 of a teaspoon of this we're going to add some citric acid again this isn't necessary but if you want them sour this is what you'll use for your vitamin c tablets and i'm going to do about half a teaspoon because the mixture the flavor packets that i'm using these kool-aid ones and crystal light already have a lot of citric acid in it and i don't want to have too much or it will break the gummies down so we're just going to do half a teaspoon and then we're going to add in our legend if you have the liquid kind you can add in about half a teaspoon to a teaspoon in my coconut oil i already have legend mixed in so if you don't already have that in your coconut oil you're going to want to make sure you have it in here i am going to still add some tear just for safe measure as i don't have that much in my coconut oil oops so i'm going to do two um little capsules i'm just going to cut them open obviously i'm making a lot of a mess and not even really much of that got in there okay let's just do another one here and we can just leave this for now um there's no reason to stir it in we will stir it in when the gelatin has bloomed i do want to mention that these gummies because they're sugar-free and aren't using um sugar or corn syrup they're going to have a little bit of a different texture than a regular gummy bear so they're going to be a little bit more jello like but i mean to sacrifice it's a sacrifice i'm going to take for less calories if you are looking for a gummy that is more um like an actual gummy i have a video on that and i'll post in a link below now let's measure out our coconut oil we're going to use a quarter cup you can use a little bit more a little bit less depending on how strong you want them to be just don't go over half a cup i think that you would need quite a bit more gelatin if you're going to do that so i'm going to spray my measuring cup just so the coconut oil doesn't stick to here and we don't waste any of it now i'm just going to pour in a quarter cup and i did take this out of the fridge a while ago so that it would liquify that way it'd be easy to pour now that we have this measured out we can warm up our gelatin mixture so we'll just take this and kind of um solidify it into this little i don't know mushy thing so we can just take that whole thing and add it into our little saucepan and we can bring this to the stove okay now we can turn the stove on to medium heat and we will just let this melt while i'm waiting for this to melt i'm just going to spray my silicone mold so they're ready once everything is done okay it looks like this is melting a bit more now just wait till that's fully melted now we can add in the coconut oil so i'm just going to pour in my coconut oil and just i should have been whisking that at the same time actually so pour it in slowly and whisk while you're pouring it in that'll help emulsify it and make sure that the oil isn't separating from the gelatin mixture so let's make sure we scrape this all out so i'm just checking to make sure that the um oil and the gelatin has binded together and it looks like it did and i believe that's because of the soy legend if you don't use soy election it probably will not bind properly and you'll find that it will separate so the legend is an essential okay now i'll just wait this um for this to start bubbling a little bit we don't want it to boil but we do want a couple bubbles to form um and then it should be good to pour into our molds so while it did emulsify together i feel like it could be better so i'm going to use my immersion blender now i know not everybody has an immersion blender which is why i was going to try and avoid using it um so while this did separate a little tiny bit the gummies would still turn out fine um i mean it looks pretty good but because i have an immersion blender i am going to use that to combine it all a little bit better but that isn't necessary if you don't have one [Applause] so i can tell it's starting to heat up quite a bit um i can see the steam coming out so i'm just gonna lower the heat a little bit so i'm like medium low now all right so again the emulsifier is not required but if you have it it's a nice touch to just ensure that everything is evenly distributed that way for your dosing you can really tell how much coconut oil is in each gummy whereas if you don't have the immersion blender and you're just hand whisking it there might be a little bit more coconut oil and one gummy over another so i want this to heat up a bit more and get a little bit thicker so i'm going to turn the heat back up to medium and just a few more minutes until this thickens up a little bit more all right we can finally see those little bubbles starting to form i think that means that it's about ready so let's just stir that a couple times and then we're gonna turn off the heat so i just turned off the heat this should be good to go now i want my gummies to be two different flavors like i said i'm gonna do the sour cream apple and the lemonade but you don't have to do two flavors you can just do one so now that our mixture is done on the stove we can add the flavoring but because i'm doing two flavors i'm going to put it into two separate bowls if you were just doing one flavor you could mix it directly into the pot okay so i'm going to add my flavor in and you can add as much as or as little as you like you could also use like i said those little liquid water enhancers so in this one i'm going to do the kool-aid sour green apple oh my gosh it smells so good that color is so pretty just make sure we don't really have any chunks left in there we'll just kind of squish them up with our spoon you want to make sure you're doing this while it's still warm you kind of have to act fast because it does kind of like form a layer on the top so we have to act fast to avoid that if not we could just throw it in the microwave for like 20 seconds so i don't know i think one packet is enough but it's hard to tell i'm just gonna taste this and see okay so it tastes good with just one package but i think i want a little bit more you can kind of taste the coconut oil a little bit too much alright that color is even better it's so green now i'm going to flavor the other one with some lemonade no okay well i'll taste that that needs more lemonade i'm really glad i added that citric acid in there too because that sour taste is so nice i almost could have had more but i mean it's risky because you don't want to break down especially because lemonade is pretty much already all citric acid and of course if you want you can double this recipe it won't have any um effect negatively you can do it double tripled whatever works for you oh yeah that tastes so good now that we've got our flavors mixed in they're ready to put into the molds so i put my molds um on a tray so that it's easy once they're filled to pick it up and put it into the fridge um i've just learned that after a few times of having to try and pick these up when they have gelatin in them so i'm going to do swirls with my two colors um not necessary but just how i want to do it now that i filled them all up we're just going to put them in the fridge and we'll wait until they have solidified i think that's going to take about like 10-20 minutes my video just cut off but they are done so i'm just popping them out of their molds and then i'm going to put them up to dry so i'm just going gonna leave them under the hood fan and my microwave um for about 24-ish hours i just want them to kind of dry out and that way um all the extra excess moisture is gone and then i'll just put them into a little baggie and keep them in my drawer they look so cute don't they anyways i hope you guys enjoyed my video i hope you guys enjoyed my video please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe i love hearing from you

videos that I've done recently and I've noticed that the most requested thing that people want are how to make weed gummies so I thought it would make weed gummy bears with you guys let me show you guys what you guys will need to make some weed gummies so the first thing that you're going to need are some type of gummy molds I chose little gummy bears and it came with a dropper which this is really convenient for transporting the gummy mixture into each of these little molds I'll have a link in the description of this video with all of the materials that I use next you will need an ounce of gelatin which is all four envelopes in the box you'll also need a pack of your favorite flavored jello I chose strawberry and you also need 1/4 of a cup of cannabis coconut oil if you don't know how to make cannabis coconut oil click up here and I'll show you how and then lastly you'll need a large saucepan and a whisk let's get to making some gummies in a saucepan on high heat you want to add your 1/4 cup of cannabis coconut oil and 1 in 1/2 cups of water to your saucepan and you want to whisk that together and let that boil and incorporate together all right I've had this boiling for about five minutes and it seems to be pretty well incorporated the next step to do is to start to add your gelatin one packet at a time and whisk it thoroughly in before adding the next packet [Music] when you first add the gelatin it starts to clump off but then as you mix it in you will see that it will fully incorporate that's when you should add the next packet of gelatin [Music] once you've added and incorporated all four packets of gelatin you can go ahead and add your packet of jell-o mix [Applause] now you're going to want to let this cook for about five to eight minutes until it fits to a rolling boil so that is what a rolling boil looks like and as you guys can see it is super stringy and it has changed consistency it is like really really goopy really sticky really thick turn your heat down to low and then we'll get ready to put this into a mold next you can go ahead and fill each of the individual bear molds be sure to continue mixing your mixture to ensure that it doesn't get clumped up it's also good to check on your mixture every few minutes because it can burn and you don't want your mixture to burn [Music] [Music] once you get it completely filled go ahead and use a paper towel to clean up the edges as much as you can as you guys can see I was a little messy but this should be fine I'm gonna go ahead and pop this in the refrigerator you want to keep it in there for about 30 minutes they should become firm after that and we'll go ahead and try these out all right I just got these out of the refrigerator now let's go ahead and plot these out and then we were taste [Music] or actually guys so here are my gummy beggars they actually turned out really cute I don't know if you guys can see that but it is a little bear Cheers I can't taste wheat in it at all it kind of just tastes like jello but they're like really firm you're definitely the right consistency they're coming I would describe it as like a gummy candy it's very sweet [Music] not weedy at all these are really really good if you liked this video give it a thumbs up leave a comment down below on what else I should make as far as cannabis edibles go because honestly taste wise I would go cannabutter cookies and then this cannabis coconut oil gummies as far as taste because these are actually like really good don't taste me at all but yeah this is cannabis gummy bears hope you guys make these because these are good and subscribe to my channel because I normally do green and we do videos every single week I'll see you guys around for whatever Shoni activity or video I come up with for next time boom you have some fun eating these companies for a while see ya [Music] [Music]", "LMD5aAC9wAk": "hi welcome to diamond delight edibles my name is liz if this is the first time you're joining you're a regular subscriber welcome back thank you so much i really do appreciate your support i really do mean that i love you guys so today i'm going to show you how to do the sour version of a gummy uh gummy candy so this has got includes the gelatin and a cooked syrup candy syrup you combine them and we then apply the sugar sweet and sour sugar right afterwards so we don't have to wait for it uh to dry uh or to figure out when we need to add it we add it right afterwards and um all right so i'll just get right started we'll get into the ingredients the equipment that you're gonna need and then how to put everything together all right well thank you so much for joining and i hope you enjoy the video okay so this recipe is done in two stages well technically three because we cook in two different stages and then we combine everything so for the first gelatin for the jello half you're going to need three tablespoons or three envelopes of unflavored gelatin one box of your favorite jello flavor a quarter cup of light corn syrup a half a teaspoon of citric acid a half teaspoon of gour gum and a quarter of a cup to a third of a cup of your can of butter and for the liquid you're going to need um a quarter cup that we're going to heat up to boiling and then a half cup that we're going to be using to bloom our gelatin and you can use any liquids that you like i like to use these um kool-aid or the kool-aid jammers these ones are good because they're a water-based and they're clear so you don't have to contend with color and they're also half the sugar so again you're not going to it helps cut back on the sugar since we got a whole ton of it in it that totally up to you though you want to definitely stick to a clear type liquid those powerades if you like those type of things those vitamin waters if you like them i don't like them they do not add the greatest of taste but if you do add juices like with it have real fruit juice in it then you're going to want to use a mold inhibitor because mold will develop very quickly and if you want to add additional colors or flavors uh we can do that i'm going to be adding 2d fruity and so i'm going to kind of make it pink and purpley i don't know tutti frutti colors and if you want to have a nice solid uh background you're going to need white food coloring so that's for the gelatin part the jello side gelatin side for the cooked candy syrup you're going to need one cup of sugar a half a cup of light corn syrup and a half a cup of water so for the equipment that you're going to need you're going to need a double boiler so you can use any pot and metal bowl i like to try and use a thicker thicker metal so that it doesn't get too hot you're going to want something to disperse your candy i love using these bottles they work great and they've got the piping tip which makes it really nice or you can use an eyedropper now this recipe is a little bit thicker so i'm not sure how well an eyedropper is going to work with it you're also going to need an oops timber you're also going to need a smaller pot for your sugar syrup and a candy thermometer two spatulas you're also going to need a hand blender and if you're going to be splitting your syrup either by doing different colors or flavors you're going to need a measuring cup to split that out if you're just doing all one you don't need that or in in lieu of a hand blender you can use whisk in a very strong forearm so the first thing that we want to do is we are going to bloom our gelatin and we are going to heat up that other quarter cup um you may need a little bit more liquid if you do you can just add it in later on if needed so we're going to heat this up in the microwave for about a minute and 20 seconds and we're going to sprinkle three tablespoons of gelatin unflavored gelatin onto our half a cup of liquid you want to kind of evenly spread it and then you're going to mix it in so that it is thoroughly mixed and that there are no lumps so you want it to kind of look like light up you want to look like applesauce and then you're going to just set that aside for five minutes and we're gonna add our boiling liquid to our jello mix and you're gonna stir that oh and you're gonna start you're gonna put your heat on to the lowest setting we just want our water to get hot we don't want it boiling gelatin melts at just hot water so we just want a hot water bath and we're going to stir that in and we're going to add in our corn syrup that's our quarter cup of corn syrup and we're just going to stir oh sorry and we're going to add in our half teaspoon of citric acid and we're going to stir that i said until it's dissolved it takes about five five six minutes or so for all of that to melt and in order to get this stuck gelatin off the side you can use some very hot water and a brush and it'll just you can wash that off otherwise if you don't it won't it doesn't melt and then it you'll get bits and stuff in your jello then you also want to make sure when you're stirring is to rub your spatula across the bottom because the sugar and the gelatin can stick to it and you don't want that so you want to make sure you'll feel it you can feel it smooth on the bottom if there's stuff stuck you'll feel it kind of rough you just kind of want to work it off scrape it off then once your gelatin or sorry your jello is fully melted we're gonna add in the gelatin and what i do is i just kind of cut it up into smaller pieces just like this and just in she goes and you're just gonna gently stir that until it's melted and if your water is hot now if the um your pots nice and hot you can turn off the heat you don't gelatin required doesn't require much heat at all to melt and if it gets too hot the gelatin will break which means it's not going to have that it's not going to your candies aren't going to set that well and the sign that you'll know that it's too hot is if you start to see white foaming stuff white foamy stuff happening on the top of your mixture here on your syrup now that everything is melted we are going to add in the can of butter and our gour gum and the reason that we have to use gour gum is it is an emulsifier and it is going to allow your oil and your your water to come together as one as one liquid versus being oil and water you know don't mix together an emulsifier allows them to come together as one solid solidified unit in short it basically mushes the oil and the water together to live happily we're going to pour in the our can of butter and i've used a third of a cup so as you can see adding you're adding the can of butter or oil to our gelatin you can mix and mix and mix until the cows come home no matter what those two are never going to blend together now you might get the appearance if you kind of whisk really really quickly you have the appearance that it's combined right that kind of looks like that's all combined however if you go and you set that and if you want to set that up now all of the butter would raise to the top of the mold now if you've got one of these little strainers or a strainer it's great for doing the guru so we're going to use a half a teaspoon of gargum and you're going to gently sprinkle evenly sprinkle it over the top if you don't have a strainer you just want to make sure to try and get it evenly over the top there this will adhere to the oil and allow it to mix in with our with the jello and i'm going to let that sit for a minute and now we're going to get our trusty hand blender [Music] and you'll continue to mix that until it is completely all one color all one unified color you don't see any kind of streaking or any kind of any difference whatsoever that's when you know it it is fully blended and emulsified and you're gonna be how about that texture and once that's done we're just going to let that set to set aside and leave it on the hot water but turn off the heat and then we're going to do our candy syrup all right so for our candy syrup we're going so for the candy syrup you want one cup of sugar a half a cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of water you're gonna mix that together until it is blend till it's all mixed up and your sugar starting to dissolve and we're going to turn the heat on to medium-high and you're going to stir the syrup until it begins to boil so as soon as it starts to boil then you are going to stop stirring that's when we add the candy thermometer and we don't stir it again and then you're also going to want to grab a jar of hot water about whatever something of hot water and a brush so you can wash down the sugar crystals off of the side and that'll prevent your syrup from crystallizing once it begins to boil there we're going to add our candy thermometer i'm going to try to add the candy thermometer now if you ever wonder why i kind of have this weird looking thing the one that i have said it setting on it that thermometer doesn't always work for me it occasionally will fail um this i like the digital but the digital um doesn't have any way of holding on to it it's more meant for just kind of sticking it into checking a temperature and then i have to use the tin foil to protect the digital from the heat so that's why i kind of have this weird makeshift candy thermometer and we're going to cook this syrup to 208 280 degrees soft crack now you can go a little bit if you want your candies a little less chewy you can go a few degrees less you can go to about 275. if you want them a lot chewier then you can go to 300. i seem to find the 280 is perfect for it well for what my liking anyway so we're going to continue to cook that syrup until 280 degrees just remember to wash down any crystal any sugar crystals that may form on the sides just to let you know you're doing this at the medium high it will go fairly quickly so don't leave the kitchen normally you do the sugars at a lower temperature so you have a little bit of time this doing it at the higher temperature it will go very quickly so i'm traveling you don't leave your kitchen and then you also want to get a pot of just cold water or a bowl of cold cold water stand by uh we're gonna put the bottom of the pot in that to stop the syrup the cooking process so we're at 276 270 see how quickly it starts to go 278 279 280 leave the candy thermometer on because we want to bring this temperature down to 240. you can turn your heat off leave it in the water until the temperature starts coming down and then we're just going to set it on the side here until that temperature comes down to 240. so once your temperature comes down you can remove the candy thermometer and we're going to add in ow be careful the syrup is still very very hot you're going to get your gelatin mixture and you're going to have a look and you're going to make sure that you don't see any green or anybody butter separation now you might see a little bit of cut like see how that color there difference that suggests your jello that the air is coming out of so don't worry about that what you care is if you see any kind of green or oily looking so that's good we're going to pour this into this candy syrup and be very careful when you're stirring this now your gelatin is going to be a lot more liquidier than the liquid liquid ear i know i come up with my own words uh then the candy syrup is going to be thicker it's also going to start to solidify as you can see on the spoon that's why you're going to gently stir it and we're going to turn the heat on to bury it to the lowest temperature and you want to make sure to take your spatula and go all the way around the edges the syrup will has a tendency to stick along those edges see so i like to use the hand blender whoops to make sure that everything is fully uh mixed together and blended and emulsified [Music] and then you're just going to gently stir to make sure that it's all nicely mixed so now at this point is when we're going to add in our flavor and additional colors if you like or as i said if you want if you're not doing that you can just go ahead and put this into your bottles right now and get ready to distribute into the molds so i'm going to be adding one of my newest favorite flavors tutti frutti love this flavor i usually use about a cup and a half and again you just want to gently get that all mixed in now if you are going to be splitting uh if you want to do two different colors this is this point you're going to put it to the transferred over to your measuring cup and split it in half or if you wanted to do two different flavors then do that before split it in half add your different flavors but i'm just doing one flavor base two colors okay so i have got now whenever you look at a um a measuring cup always look at it straight on get down at the level and look at it straight on if you look at it from a down level you see you don't get an accurate reading that looks like two and a quarter cups however it's more like two and a third cups so for this one i'm going to do i'm gonna add some more red and i like to use the no taste red i hate the taste of red dye i can always taste it and everything so i like the no taste red the one thing about it however is it doesn't have quite the intensity of red that the regular does but i'd rather forsake a little bit of the intensity on the color versus the intensity on the flavor there we go that's a nice red and the other side i'm going to do purple i'm going to add in some pink i want a more pinky purple versus a dark purple and a couple drops of blue now mix that up see what we get now right now because we did i didn't add the white into it and it looks like it's a solid color it's actually it'll come out kind of still a little bit translucent so if you want to get a solid background and that it's not going to lighten up or get that kind of clear or translucent look you want that solid opaque then you need to add in the white so i'm going to add a couple drops into white on both sides so we have here when we add in the white it's going to dull down our color a little bit so that i'm just going to add in a little bit more of the red and add a little bit more to the purple purple i think i'm gonna leave i like that color but the red i wanna looks kind of orangey and see how much nicer that color is now it's a lot richer and gives you more that solid background makes it opaque versus having that translucent look to it and now i'm just going to get ready to pour it in the bottles and distribute it into the molds all right so now we're ready to distribute into the molds and you can go do half and halves now don't fill up your mold all the way to the top if you do it ends up leaving a sharp edge on your candy that dries out and it doesn't make your candies very pleasant so don't fill them all the way up to the top and it's also when you're trying to pour try and keep it to the middle and just let it distribute it out once you have your mold set up while all filled up you put it into the fridge for uh two hours sometimes it may take a little bit longer basically two hours or until they're set all right so it's been a couple of hours and our candies are ready to come out of the molds and we're gonna make up our sugar sour mix so you're going to add one cup of sugar and to that you're going to add a half a teaspoon of citric acid cut it and you want to make sure to thoroughly mix that in so you're going to get even citric acid on everything not just get like a big hunk of it on one candy that's kind of gross so you want to make sure to thoroughly mix it in now the nice thing with this recipe is as soon as we take them out of the molds we're going to put them right into the sugar this sugar mix you don't have to worry about waiting for them to dry or partially dry before we can add it and the reason for that is citric acid is water soluble so when you do the other gummy recipe when you just take them out they're still wet and gummy bears are essentially water and gelatin so as soon as there's any moisture on them the citric acid will begin will automatically begin to melt it doesn't do it on this because you have the sugar coating or the sugar candy syrup in there that helps protect the gelatin and that's why they don't melt as soon as you put it on and that's why this recipe is way better for doing sour or sugar coated candies now these guys are going to be a lot stickier than your regular gummy recipe so you just kind of pull it and they'll start to peel out and then you just work them out and then just pop them right into your sugar sour mix and as they warm up a bit uh they will start to get a little more tacky so no worries as long as you can pull them out of the molds they're good and they do stick to your fingers they do just kind of put it down into the sugar you can just kind of rub it in and it'll get them off that's nice once the your sugar or your sugar sour mix is on they no longer stick together see look at that and then you just put them on the rack to dry as per usual now what i like to do is i like to put holes in my parchment paper so that way you're getting air from both sides it helps with drying the other nice thing with this recipe is it doesn't take anywhere near as long for these to dry as the regular gummy recipes they're pretty much dry in a few hours to overnight now if they do start to get a little too warm and too hard to get out of the mold just put them back in the fridge for a little while if you actually keep a little bit of sugar on your fingers once they get a little bit sticky it'll help with them not sticking to your fingers a little aid with them coming off see if they stick they will fuse just pull them apart now if you're taking these out and they're just not coming out they're way too sticky um they're too gooey you can put them back in the fridge for a couple of hours or um and if you take them out and they're still not going to come out what you can do is uh put them in the freezer for about an hour take them out put them back in the double boiler on low re-melt them and add a half a tablespoon to one tablespoon of bloomed unflavored gelatin and that should add enough a little more gelatin there that'll fix that right up and if you find that they are too gummy oh sorry not if they're too gummy if they're too chewy they're like rubber bands again same thing just put them back on the double boiler on low remelt them and add a couple of tablespoons of um liquid to it and mix it all in until it's all melted recast them and that should take care of that problem if you've taken them out and there's um your butter is all risen to the back same thing just put them into the double boiler re-melt them add a little bit more gargum and re-emulsify make sure to use the hand blender or your whisk really really well like i showed you earlier so again if they're stuck like that uh check first to see just gently work around if they come away then you're good you can pull it out of the mold but if they're doing that they're not coming it's not coming away at all then they need to either go into the longer go into the fridge longer or to add some more gelatin to them they are a little bit more work but they are definitely worth it in texture and flavor in everything i've pretty much abandoned the other gummy bear recipe personally i just use this recipe now i'll just do either sugar coated or the sweet or the sugar and sour mix option is if um they are being really sticky um they are kind of coming out they're set but they're just really sticky um that can happen because it gets it picks up a little bit too much moisture in the refrigerator you can just let them sit in the molds for a couple of hours on the counter before taking them out that'll assist in drying that out a little bit now if you can stand your candies up it's a good idea some of them won't stand up though too small to whatever decides so if you can stand them up great if not you just want to flip them over every couple of hours until they're dry and as i said before this recipe and the drying time is it's a lot less time and that's it for them so just leave them out and enjoy some awesome sweet and sour gummy candies so that's my tutorial on sweet and sour gummy candies these are the little bad boys they haven't dried yet but you can see they're really nice they're little that little squishy now because they're still wet tastes awesome so i hope you give this recipe a try whether you want to do just sugar coated or the sugar sour it's a great recipe i'm sure that you'll love it if you have any questions at all don't hesitate to put them in the comments i'll always get back to you and i think that's everything i've got for you today well thank you so much for joining time diamond delight

item we have here is our dry ingredients now there's going to be a clear seal around the top we're going to want to find the perforation and break that and go ahead and remove that seal and set back to the side next in we have our corn syrup once again we have a seal going around the ring of the top go ahead and pull the serrated portion off and remove that circular seal setting again to the side you'll see two packets of unflavored gelatin and one gel cap [Music] and now we'll unwrap our mold and our dropper our dropper will have a bulb at the top that needs to be pulled back so that the plastic tip of the dropper is fully exposed if it comes apart no worries you can always put it right back together the remaining items in the video will come from your kitchen a small plastic cereal bowl nothing special you'll also need a spoon any spoon will do I like to use just a plastic spoon that I can toss I'm gonna place 1/4 cup of cool water into my plastic bowl moving on to opening my unflavored gelatin packets I'm going to sprinkle those over the water while I stir it with my spoon I'm gonna go at a relative decent speed not super slow this is done in real time you don't need to go slower than this you just want to make sure that everything touches the water and that you don't have any large clumps it may look like baby food applesauce or mashed potatoes [Music] once you feel the unflavored gelatin is mixed in well we'll set that bowl to the side to allow the gelatin to bloom and soften you will need a 2 quart saucepan I'm going to pour 1/2 cup of cool water into my saucepan I've not turned my heat on yet at this time you will also want to have a tool whether it be a whisk or a silicone spatula to work with I will be adding my corn syrup to my 1/2 cup of cool water that is in the 2 quart saucepan I'll gently mix that with the water to dissolve it part way [Music] I'll then take my gel cap and use a small pair of scissors to snip the end and squeeze the contents into my saucepan [Music] on to our dry ingredients if you've not removed the top go ahead and do so and pour all ingredients into the saucepan I'll gently mix mine in and turn my heat on medium [Music] I'll bring this pot up to a slow boil over medium heat stirring occasionally [Music] once you reach a fast simmer slow boil you're going to take your heat down to low and allow that to simmer for approximately five minutes once again stirring on occasion you will see some foam on the top of your mixture as the water simmers out I'm now going to add my distillate concentrate I have a 1 gram syringe at 85% my heat is still on low I'm going to stir this in until I feel it is incorporated well and then turn my heat off I like to use my spatula to separate my gelatin from the bowl and kind of like a puck and I use the spatula to lower that gelatin puck gently into my candy syrup as it is quite warm I'll gently stir the gelatin and this can take up to two minutes to fully dissolve you can use the edges of your pot for heat if you need to push a clump of gelatin up against the edge to get it to dissolve I am going to increase the video speed on this portion but I will not cut the video this will be from the time I've put the puck in until it is dissolved [Music] I'll now transfer my gelatin mix into my measuring cup [Music] using my dropper I will swirl my liquid around and begin filling the cavities in my mold each cavity holds two milliliters so you are going to fill that to the top you'll get about two and a half cavities from each dropper full it is important that you take your time here you don't want to squirt a lot of your gelatin mixture across the counter you will have time to fill your mold before your gelatin cools once I have all cavities full I'm going to allow my gelatin to set at room temperature for two hours once I have confirmed they are set I'm going to put the entire mold into the freezer for 30 minutes before I pop them out Wow would you look at that color ooh squishy - once my gummies are fully set I will remove them and place them on parchment paper for 24 hours to cure it is purely preference as to whether you sugar or don't sugar if you are planning to sugar coat one in sugar and leave set for one hour to ensure that they are cured enough to sugar without sweating if your sugar gummy does sweat after an hour leave them for an additional 12 to 24 hours and give it another go I'll be sugaring about half of my batch once I do have the sugared gummies done I'll leave them for 24 to 36 hours to crystallize [Music]

watching", "gwyTK2hK9pc": "hello everyone and welcome to making gummies 101 today I'm going to explain an easy and simple way of making homemade gummies if you dig this video please punch that like button and don't forget to subscribe for future and easy 101 cannabis videos today i'm gonna be using cannabis infused vegetable glycerin and we'll be doing this without using additional sugar however I will be using jello and that's basically pure sugar I do use my own homegrown and I will be making a separate video on how to make the glycerin so materials I'm gonna be using today are gonna be a pan a whisk a spatula some gummy molds and a syringe the ingredients I'm gonna be using is one cup of cannabis infused vegetable glycerin 12 ounces of flavored gelatin of your choice so I'm using the cause of the blue raspberry jello yeah the blue raspberry jello one cup of fruit juice of your choice I use real apple juice I really like the taste of it and it makes it can really bring out the other flavors easy it's kind of a neutral flavor I don't recommend using citrus juices pineapple juice or orange juice nope two and a half ounces of unflavored gelatin I recommend knocks it's very sturdy keeps everything together it's it's pretty hardcore as far as gelatin scum a quarter cup of honey or agave syrup I use agave I recommend natural honey it can be a little difficult to mix but you know it's a lot healthier so either way is good and one tablespoon of tart and sour or citric acid powder in this case I use citric acid powder so I've started off by separating all my ingredients by my citric acid powder my Knox and my jello I'm gonna start by combining all of my gelatin together once they're in the same bowl I can give them a proper stirring okay that's looking good next we're going to be moving on to the agave syrup and the apple juice I've already added the agave syrup to the apple juice I'm just mixing them together now once they are mixed I'm going to add them to the bowl of gelatin powder now I want to whisk this gently I have to make sure it's mixed properly so I don't have clumps of sugar stuck together and you know in the end ruining some of my gummies once it's finished put it to one side and let it bloom while this is happening I'm gonna heat up my vegetable glycerin it'll take about an hour and a half and in that time the gel will starting to thicken so right here I have one cup of cannabis infused vegetable glycerin it's been on low for about an hour and a half it does take some time to heat up and start to smoke so just be patient don't let it smoke too much though or it will burn keep it low keep an eye on it and keep stirring it circularly every now and again with my molds lined up I'm ready to pour my jello into my vegetable glycerin since my jello has been sitting there for an hour and a half it's giving it time to solidify a little bit from here I can scrape it out of the bowl directly into the pan it's good to use a spatula for this part just to ensure you're not wasting anything and you get it all over the bowl at this point I'm going to use my whisk just to give it a nice gentle stirring it's okay if you want to turn the heat up a little bit at this point just to help melt the jello as long as you keep stirring it and afterwards you turn it back down again it's too high for too long you will burn you're just doing this to melt the jello once it looks thoroughly mixed in it's a good color and consistency to you grab your syringe as you can see I have assistance but it's okay if you're by yourself and you have to stop stirring to fill up your molds as long as in between filling your syringe you just give it a little stir give it a little stir so right here I'm basically just showing how I fill them up I'll edit this speed up the process but I try not to keep the syringe too high above because then it can create bubbles and your gummies and just visually it's not very pleasing that's all [Music] my personal favorites are the snowmen the very big you know I can use one syringe or I can use four syringes for me it's nice because it's a great way to control the dosage so I'm just gonna finish up these last little few right here make sure I finished with everything in the pan and then I'm just gonna pop them in the fridge give them a chance to cool down and get them all ready now for the final process I'm gonna keep them in the fridge for 8 to 16 hours usually the longer the better so they stay solid now that a few hours begun by I'm ready to take them out these those are my bears thanks to the Knox gelatin this should pop out righties look at that hey mister bear you look pretty solid I can actually identify what you are cool beans once that's done we can bag them and tag them so here's all my gummies in total not you shabby we got our festive snowflakes good our presence went mine done ripen one of those Halloween on Christmas we got our spiders we got our bats oh yeah and up here we have our snowmen well actually two sets of snowmen the badness to Frosty's you can see how thick those are my personal favorite and then there are smaller counterparts right there alright everyone so that's it thank you very much for coming by and checking out this video I hope you liked making gummies 101 don't forget to Like and subscribe for future videos and any comments or anything as well please feel free to drop them I'd be growing happy smoking happy eating", "dwhdujJvYFY": "[Music] hi everyone thank you for joining me today this educational video is about hemp oil edibles you heard me right edibles you don't have to take a tincture and hold a liquid under your tongue and may not taste very good and so forth just like vitamins come in gummy form you too can have a cbd product as an edible as a gummy as a chocolate as a honey stick hard candy the list goes on and on and on and i'm going to show you a few that we carry at our store just for show and tell so you can see what it looks like for example peach rings this one's very popular uh this is a six no i'm sorry this is a 1200 milligram jar by the way when you see 1200 milligrams you're not getting 1200 milligrams in one gummy this is 1200 in the entire container in the entire jar so 1200 milligrams you're getting 60 pieces if you're taking one piece a day it'll last you two months this one happens to be 20 milligrams per chewable hence 60 times 20 equals 1200 milligrams total this is very confusing to a lot of people because they think that they're getting the 1200 every time they eat one i hear it all the time no you're not you're getting 20 milligrams per chewable that's important to know because some people need maybe 10 20. we have some by mile high for example those are 50 milligrams per edible and sometimes you just need something stronger it just really depends on what you're trying to address so just remember whenever you see that big number it stands for the number the amount number of milligrams per container that one happened to have been a just your typical regular gummy but there's also chewables that are for example these fruit snacks this one is vegan has no dyes as you can see the color is more natural looking it's they're using fruit to color it so it doesn't have yellow number five and blue number three and what have you that's important to some people and then uh these come in full spectrum or broad spectrum or isolates and sometimes we have also a pm formula some of them have a little bit of melatonin to help you with sleep but there's different ways to take it i like tiger woods who likes his chin gum when he's out there playing golf and is stressed out and needs something to calm his nerves you can have a chewing gum you can have mints you can have chocolate fruit bites pistachio bites we have almond butter and honey in a jar that you can just take it out and eat it and it's delicious and you're dosing yourself with cbd just know how to shop for it though because about eighty percent of all edibles out there are made with isolated products so what that means is the cbd is it's just that it's just pure cbd when it's an isolate it's used in edibles because it doesn't have the waxes and the chlorophyll and it doesn't have that hempy flavor it's good but it's not great and when you're out there shopping make sure you ask is this an isolate is this a broad spectrum or is this a full spectrum now if you get drug tested at work and you're afraid that you may fail a drug test by all means ask for a broad spectrum or an isolate because those have zero thc and it will put your mind at ease and you don't have to worry about failing a drug test but you know there are some people who just can't have the tincture don't want to have the tincture and for those people i say well have a gummy it's actually very easy to port if you're getting on an airplane if you're at work and uh you want to keep some gummies or something in your desk great no problem easy to carry around i've had a lot of women who've carried their hemp oil bottle in their purses i've done it myself where you don't screw on the top totally and a little bit of that oil leaks and it gets in your purse it's messy and it happens it happens so that's not fun but you know what you can have a gummy a chewable chewing gum what have you and you can dose yourself easily that way and you can leave your hemp oil bottle at home and just carry some gummies at work and or when you're traveling just take the gummies i hope this video was helpful to you and making a decision as to whether you want or need an edible it's certainly very easy to dose to children and sometimes to older people who already take a lot of medication which by the way if you're taking hemp oil you can probably get off of most if not all of your prescription medication by taking hemp oil i can you can watch that in my next video where i talk about that and how it's benefited so many people and why they're able to get off their medication it's not a big mystery but there is a reason why you're able to do that i hope you enjoyed this video if you have any suggestions or comments for me uh for my next video please feel free to do so let me know with social media i'm happy to do the research and again thank you for watching i hope you have a beautiful and blessed day", "27FZ8LbDpkQ": "hi everyone welcome back to my channel today we're gonna be talking CBD again specifically we have been talking about CBD dosage how much should you be taking [Music] so one of the questions I've had coming up with my comment section quite a lot and a lot of people have been messaging me asking this as well and that's been Andy how much do take Andy how much should I take how much CBD should I be take one of the most important things that we need to realize is that everybody it's different everybody has a different metabolic rate and the amount of CBD that you should be taking to get the results you want will be different to someone else most CBD products that you buy will have a dosage written on the bottle my suggestion is to absolutely ignore Matt and follow some simple steps to work out the effective dose for you and for you personally this is referred to quite often as the sweet spot on websites and it's a mistake that I certainly made in the beginning just relying on the on the information on the bottle and not taking into account my personal circumstances it's really important to say that the method that you're taking your CBD is going to make a big big difference to how much absorbs into your body so 120 milligrams product might not be the same as the next 20 milligram product my advice is to find a product that works for you to find a method that works for you and stick with it then you're not message messing with dosage and you're not confusing your body by absorbing a different amount by using different ways one for one example is taking CBD fire oil under the tongue is going to absorb much quicker into your body than taking it in a capsule for example so if you've been using it under the tongue don't expect to be able to use the same dose if you take it from a capsule as the amount that broth absorbs into your bloodstream is going to be different so as I said the biggest mistake I made when I first start taking CBD or was just to go straight in and take the amount on the bottle I've quite been open about the fact that I've been using CBD pure hemp oil 600 it's been a great product for me and I went straight in and just started doing the exact suggestion on the bottle and it says on here suggested use and it says to take 1 mil and which is which for this pot was approximately half a dropper under the tongue hold for 60 seconds before swallowing now 1 mil of oil in this border in this bottle will give me 10 milligrams of CBD and this goes on say to take it twice daily or as needed so that's what I did so I was getting 20 milligrams of CBT per day I was quite lucky in the sense that actually I got really good results from taking 20 milligrams of CBD per day however I've realized that not everyone is that lucky to go straight in and find the the right dose for them so what I would recommend you do when you first get your bottle when you first start taking CBD or if you've been taking CBD and not guessed necessarily getting the results you need I would say follow these steps and you should find that the results work for you so the first thing to do is to make sure you've worked out the amount of CBD per mil from your bottle I said each product is different the number that the bottle gives you so in this case 600 milligrams that means that there's a total of 600 milligrams in this bottle so that makes no adjustment for the bottle size or the amount of CBD mil so while some bottles may seem higher dose or a lower dose actually it's more about the concentrate than amount about the amount you're getting so it's very easy to work out the amount of CBD that you're getting per mil work out the amount of CBD in total so in this case 600 milligrams and work out how many mills are in the bottle and divide that by the amount of mils in the bottle and that will tell you how many mills you get how many milligrams you're getting of CBD per mil of oil most CBDs will come with a dropper so you will be able to and measure quite successfully the the dose that you're getting and I think in most cases the droppers are about the same size and the majority of droppers I've seen a two mil tapas so as I said in this case it's a 60 ml bottle 600 milligrams of oil so you're getting 10 milligrams of CBD per mil of oil once you've worked out the amount of milligrams of CBD per mil of oil you can then start working out the effective dose for you now remember everyone's different so what someone else is taking but is not relevant to you whatsoever don't ask other people what they're taking and don't mimic that because it is absolutely irrelevant to you your sweet spot and your effective dose is absolutely unique to you so the way to find that sweet spot is to start low if you start taking a total of five milligrams per day try that for a few days and then increasing the amount of oil over the next few days again and keep doing that until you find the most effective dose so my recommended cycle would be to start from two point five milligrams in the morning to point five milligrams at night try that for three days three days if you're still not getting the results you want up that take take five milligrams in the morning five milligrams at night just keep doing that and eventually you'll start getting the results that you want without taking too much oil the other benefit to the fact that the or you're taking less is the fact that URL then should last you longer if you only need five milligrams of CBD per day then you're then you'll use much less oil and this bottle here will last you longer than as if unit if you need thirty milligrams a day dosage is much easier to calculate with oils and capsules and measurable quantities of CBT it gets much harder than when we start looking at a vape pen in all honesty I could not tell you how much CBD I'm getting each time I vape to work that out would be pretty complicated CBD vapor vape juice has a number on the bottle so my case is 400 milligrams and that's in a 10 ml bottle yeh again that is the total amount of CBD in the bottle to get a consistent dose every single time you vape means your you would have to be taking exactly the same amount in each time you would also need to know exactly how many times you take the CBD before you finish the whole bottle in order to break it down so what I've been doing because I find I found vaping to be very relaxed eval ative to my CBD routine is my effective dose works at around 30 milligrams of CBD per day so I've been taking 10 milligrams of oil in the morning I've been taking around 15 milligrams of oil at night and then I've been vaping occasionally throughout the day now I'm definitely not getting a consistent dose however it's close enough because I'm not vaping constantly that it's working out well for me if you're someone that allof apes and vapors all day then that's gonna be a big difference for you and it's going to be much more difficult for you to work out exactly how much you're getting and to keep that consistent so just be careful that you're not taking too much by using multiple ingestion methods if you're a regular vapor if it's something you're doing occasionally I think it's much more easy to manage because you can simply vape less if you're finding you're going over the required dose or if you'll getting some side effects you don't want the biggest piece of advice I can give when working at your dosage is to not quit too early I've spoke to quite a lot of people that said oh I've been trying to CBD for the past few days and it's not working for me absolutely not you're not going to get full effect in the first two or three days you might be get lucky and you might get some results I found a lot of people that are dealing with pain management again really really quick results I got some really quick results on day one for my depression and it really uplifted me but I think I got quite lucky with the dosage most people are going to have to use it for a few days to build up the the receptors and to learn to increase the effects of the CBD oh there is some chance of some side-effects in the first few days I've heard lots of reports of people getting diarrhea and I believe that might be because of the anti-inflammatory nature of it but it does pass after a few days of trying and using that the the nasty toilet trip should end but actually you should feel pretty positive for that afterwards as it's cleared your system out a little bit and and should make you a bit more comfortable I've heard some great results from people with IBS and even Crohn's disease that have used CBD and and it's really helped them because of it's amazing anti-inflammatory properties so to conclude the most important thing here is that you find the effective dose for you as we've all got different metabolic rates that is gonna vary from person to person so don't waste your time trying to mimic what other people do to get the same results spend the time workout your sweet spot work out your own effective dose and work out how much and you needs to get the results that you need different people and different conditions are always going to need a different dose and always going to take time to find that dose and see what's most effective but I promise you stick with it and it's worth the wait it's it's been absolutely amazing for me my use of CBD is totally changed my life and it's totally started to turn my life around and and it's and its really changing my life for the better in many way anyways and and again I just want to stress I'm not a doctor I'm not giving you medical advice here please please please do all of this under the advice of your doctor don't use it to come off any medication without taking the appropriate advice and steps none of this is intended as medical advice all I can tell you is what I've done and what I found effective for me and that's a really important part to play I can't stress any more how important it is to talk to your doctor and really listen as far as your own conditions are concerned and your own body is concerned but then also listen to your own body your body will tell you if you're taking too much if you're the inside effects you don't like if you're getting sleepy if you'll get in issues of and I've just got I've heard people get in issues of nausea because they don't like the oil so the capsules have worked better for them and an even vice-versa in some occasions so listen to your body do some research read up on the benefits and the side effects of CBD and make a judgment call for yourself alongside any medical advice you've got from your doctor that's really really important it may be working for me but it's not a miracle cure anyone that tells you that CBD is a miracle cure that can cure actually any ailment they're lying they're just trying to sell your products on most occasions it will take still to take hard work I think CBD is a great symptom medicine but it won't kill all your problems so use this as an opportunity to work on the cause well you've got some respite from the symptoms as well thanks guys speech you soon [Music]", "LZJbqRUlzRA": "[Music] uh what's up guys welcome back today we're going to do a little experiment with gummy worms and tincture so i just bought some like these are from walmart just walmart brand gummy bears or gummy worms this should work the same for gummy worms gummy bears um anything with this type of gummy texture um so we're gonna do an experiment and we're gonna soak them in tincture i don't know how long it's gonna take i don't know if it's gonna be like a few hours that we're gonna need in there or 24 hours but we're going to see how that's going to turn out all you're going to need is some gummy bears or gummy worms and some alcohol-based tincture [Music] so here i just have some gummy worms like i said they're just the walmart brand i have my tincture and then a little container that we're going to put our gummy worms into now i'll just line up the gummies trying not to overlap them too much and then i'm going to pour my tincture over them just enough tincture to cover them all or at least the most of them and then whatever tincture isn't absorbed you can just pour back into a jar and use it as you would have previously so as you guys just saw i pretty much just pour tincture over these gummy worms i did add one or two more because i was taking a thumbnail for it but that's how they look we're going to leave them uncovered and we're not going to put them in the fridge we're just going to leave them open on the counter and then i am going to check back in when i feel like these are ready so we'll see how long that's going to take and we'll see if they work out hi guys so it's been about 24 hours a little bit under and here is what the gummies look like so they don't look that much different so far but it's kind of hard to tell they might be swollen a little bit um but yeah so i'm just taking these out and i'm gonna set them out to dry and then once they're mostly dry but not completely dry we're going to cover them with some sugar of course that's optional it just because extra sugar is nice and then plus the sugar on the outside will help with that tincture flavor like as soon as your tongue touches the gummy now that they've dried so they're pretty much completely dry except for a little bit of stickiness i'm gonna cover them in sugar so i just have a little container with just plain sugar you can add citric acid if you want but if you use citric acid just please use a small small amount like one quarter teaspoon for like one cup of sugar type of thing because too much citric acid will draw out the moisture and then they'll get wet and they'll never dry so yeah so i'm just shaking those and it's kind of weird how um they're coming out not completely coated in sugar or at least that um orange one did but then this one here is only like parts of it picked up on the sugar so i'm not sure what's going on there um but here is how you want them to be sticky wise so if you put your finger on it it like kind of sticks but you can pull it off pretty easily still and that's a good consistency for it to be when you're adding sugar to it um but yeah so some of these the sugar attached properly and then some of them they didn't and i'll show you guys how we can fix that though it's not exactly the most efficient way but i mean you got to do what you got to do when you're playing around with these things i'm thinking for those spots that aren't filled with sugar i'm just going to use like a regular paintbrush i think this is just from the dollar store whatever it doesn't matter um and then i'm going to dip it into the tincture which i should have got a separate container for my tincture so the sugar wasn't going back and forth but um and then i'm just going to lightly wipe it on the areas of the gummy that didn't get any sugar attached to it and not too much you just want like a light light coat and then i just put it back into the container of sugar and shake it up and then take it out and leave it to dry and it came out very well it was all covered it just would be time consuming to have to do this for each gummy [Music] and i'm going to try one of the gummies that we're soaking so far they don't look like they've soaked up that much like they don't look much bigger than how they looked before so just doing a comparison here the ones on the parchment paper are the ones that were soaking and then this one my hand was not soaking so for size difference it looks like the soaked one may be like a millimeter bigger but i don't i don't know it doesn't really seem like it um and then with this one over here um which one is bigger the soaked one definitely looks bigger for sure but also looks skinnier and the other one looks wider so it's hard to tell i'm not sure if the gummy bears maybe just aren't all consistent or sorry the worms okay and then for this one the one on the bottom there is the not soaked one and it's significantly bigger than the soaked one so that leads me to think that the gummy worms are just kind of have some variance in size and that they didn't look like they've gotten bigger and expanded or absorbed anything so let's let's try and see how it tastes and see if we can taste the tincture you can definitely taste like the strong tincture on it right away i kind of got like weird texture on it it's like from i don't know if it's just the brand of dining rooms that i use but like kinda like slimy i don't like that well i don't not like the gummy worm i just don't like the slime it's kind of like a weird texture so far like but i don't know i feel like that you're i can only taste the tincture on the outside i don't feel like it actually soaked up anything so i'm gonna try it rinsing one off and like washing wiping it down really good with some water so that if the if it is just tincture on the outside then we'll be able to find out because if i rinse off water it should still taste like tincture on the inside right so i'm gonna go do that and i'll be right back and we'll try and see how that tastes okay so here's the gummy i just rinsed very well i taste exactly like the original gummy worm did so it does i have no taste of tincture in it at all which is proving that it didn't soak it up which is really weird because if gummies soak up alcohol to make alcoholic gummies why wouldn't it soak up tincture so i'm very shocked and i'm like wondering if i did something wrong like why didn't they soak it up i wonder if it was the brand should i try this same thing on a variety of different brands of gummies like buy a bunch of different brands of gummy bears and see which one soaks up the most would you guys be interested in me doing a video like that but yeah since um essentially they didn't soak up anything it's kind of a waste so i think a better way to be going about it is to just put some tincture on them like put them in a container and mix it up or something and then set them out to dry a little bit and then cover them with sugar i'll try that and we'll see how that works as well so here we're just gonna place some fresh gummy worms into a jar of tincture then we're just gonna close the lid and shake it up so that they all get covered in the tincture and then we will take them all out with a fork trying to be careful not to waste too much tincture um from holding them from the jar to the drying area so just kind of shake them off a little bit so there's not too much dripping and then just leave them to dry until they're just slightly sticky and depending on how much airflow you have it can take anywhere between 20 minutes to a couple of hours so once they're not wet anymore and they're just a little bit sticky you can put them in sugar you don't have to but it's nice so that you're not having that direct tincture on your tongue so i'm just shaking these up and then i'm gonna put them back out to dry but these were not dry enough when i did this so you guys are gonna see what happens so i could tell immediately as soon as i opened it you see how the sugar is almost like chunky on there i don't know if you can really see it but um so it chunks up in i kind of shook it off there but you can still see it's like the sugar crystals gather together so that's what happens when there's too much moisture and these are not going to dry so yeah they're nice and chunky um even i can try leaving them out but they probably will very likely not dry they'll just keep pulling out moisture so you guys can see this is what the sugar looks like because now it's been contaminated with moisture i guess you could say so you can see it clumped up immediately just from that little bit too much of moisture and i'm gonna get some regular sugar so you guys can see a side by side of what it should look like so there's a regular granulated sugar and then i'm gonna pour the one that had a little bit of moisture in it and you can see those clumps that it's made and how it has a less fine of the texture so just when you're making your gummies make sure that before you put your sugar on they're fully dry because this is a very common thing people their gummies get all like wet and moist and it's because your gummy was too wet when you coated it in the sugar so here's one of the gummies that was coated when it wasn't wet and just only slightly sticky and you can see the sugar looks perfect there's no wetness and it's not clumpy and then if we pull up one of the ones we just did where it was too wet you can see the sugar is starting to pull out the moisture and the whole thing is getting that wet look and i'm just gonna continue to keep doing this um in this case i'm just going to eat them like that because they're not really salvageable because rinsing them off will remove the tincture that we dip them in so you want them to be just sticky like this so they're not wet at all just only a slight stickiness we're not going to use that sugar that's been contaminated with the moisture because it's going to not give us nicer so i'm just dipping these little sticky ones into a dish of fresh sugar and then again leave them out to dry and it'll probably need about 24 hours to fully dry before you package them up overall i think the best method for trying to infuse store-bought candies is using my sour patch method um i'll post a link for it in the description box and i'll try and post one on the video as well um but yeah check this out this is a lot easier they're gonna be a lot stronger it's just an all-around better option the only difference is that you definitely need a candy that already has a sugar coating on it thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you guys enjoyed it please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe i hope you have a wonderful day", "cFwlIAzxTGc": "[Music] hi welcome back to Diamond delight animals my name is Liz and this is the first time you're joining and if you're a regular welcome back so today I am going to show you how to make these awesome Jolly Rancher gummies from actual Jolly Ranchers that's right so I make these with canister up you can also do them with the can of sugar if you want to know how to make those I do have videos they're made from textures there is a specific one can of sugar and then the other one for the can of syrup is can of flour powdered sugar and syrup not well show you how to make the syrup if you'd like so from the actual gummy art from Jolly Ranchers I've made these gummies and I'm going to show you just how to do that so it's usually I'm going to jump right into those ingredients and what we need to put that together and get it all put together for you so you can make these awesome candies well one thing I did I want to tell you so in the recipe I used three and a half tablespoons of unflavored gelatin I would recommend using four tablespoons of unflavored gelatin to the same three quarter cups of liquid so I I will put the correction in the ingredients in the comments I do sorry I'm they turned it a little bit softer than probably what I like so I would go with four tablespoons of the unflavored gelatin all right so now we'll jump into those ingredients and get right to her alrighty so for our Jolly Rancher gummies what we're going to need is about twenty of your preferred flavour of Jolly Ranchers so I'm going to use the blue raspberry and peeled of course take off graphics you're going to need a quarter cup of can of syrup that we're going to mix with this then for our candy syrup we are going to need one cup of white sugar regular sugar and 1/4 cup of can of syrup and a quarter cup of regular light corn syrup 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid and a quarter cup of water for syrup then we're going to need three and sorry three and a half tablespoons to four so if you've got the packages of the gelatin you can just use the four packets they got a little bit off one you'll be good and 3/4 of a cup of water for your gelatin cold it needs to be very cold and then for our equipment we are going to need a candy thermometer a double boiler if you don't have a double boiler just use a pot where another heat safe Bowl will fit on top and that will suffice another pot for your candy syrup a couple of spatulas and then your bottles if you've got the bottles for dispensing your syrup if you don't have these guys these are great things if not you just use your eye droppers you've got those and of course your molds and that's everything we need to get started so let's jump right in and get it going alright so our very first step we want to do is bloom our gelatin so you are going to take your three and a half tablespoons and you're going to sprinkle it over your liquid you want to kind of get it all mixed around and then you're gonna get that you're gonna mix this in your gelatin into your liquid so you don't have any lumps and while you're mixing this this is a good yet to know whether your gelatin is a good strength or that it's not too old while you're mixing this it should already start to gel and while you're mixing it it should how to get turns to about the consistency of applesauce and that's how you know your gelatin is good and then we're going to just put that aside to bloom or total ready to loot till we need it now we are going to melt our our Jolly Ranchers and our corn syrup so we are going to melt our Jolly Ranchers and a quarter cup of our corn syrup all on our double boil just don't forget to put water in your bottom of your double boiler I've done it how come I plug it in hold on alright so we're gonna turn our heat on to medium medium or medium-high and we're gonna get our candy put your Jolly Ranchers into the pot mine got a little stuck in the bowl here got a lot of humidity too don't want to give it up gotcha and we're gonna put in our quarter cup of corn syrup our can of corn syrup and that eats up everything will begin to melt the Jolly Ranchers will start to melt you just want to try and get the candies covered and covered in the syrup just start getting things moving around but just going to continue to stir and this until the until your candies though the Jolly Ranchers are completely melted so it does take a while for the candies for the Jolly Ranchers to melt just be patient it does get kind of goofy and glumpy don't you can see that but just be patient it will all nose what I do is I let it sit for about a minute or so let it get heated up and then I stir it around breaking trying to break it up mush it down you just don't want to really overwork it does that just continue to do that your lumpy mess will turn into a nice syrup will see very shortly all right so now my candy start my Jolly Ranchers are all melted so you can see that a little better so we're just gonna set this off to the side for about five minutes to let that cool down before we add in our gelatin because if we add in our gelatin now it'll be too hot and it can break through gelatin that's a lot of problems that happens with with it so the next stage I'm just gonna let that cool down and we'll add in our gelatin and get that melted in and then we'll make that by the candy syrup and get it all put together so now that my syrup is cooled down it's time to add in the gelatin and I like to just do this and cut it up into smaller pieces and then we'll just plop we're all in and get that melting now you'll find if it's not melting you can turn your heat on to low put it back on the double boiler auctioneers probably enough heat from the water still from the double boiler to to melt the gelatin if it's not hot enough right still Cece was started melting because we have the cold temperature and the warm you can kind of have a separation here but once everything comes to the same temperatures and everything will mix together so you may find that your candy is kind of is starting to solidify getting a little clumpy well the gelatin is not really is not fully melting if that's the case then turn your heat on to low or just want to gently heat the reheat that up you just have to be patient with this because it is gonna take a few about five or five minutes or so for everything to come together properly you might think oh no it's not working but don't worry be patient so you're going to continue to gently stir this over the low heat until everything your Jolly Ranchers and your gelatin of all melts together in one even uniform syrup and there's nothing sticking to the bottom of the pot yeah once everything is melted together and everything's one uniform texture and color and there's nothing sticking to the bottom and now if you find here you may want to add a little bit of additional food coloring because the blue with the green it's gonna muddle that blue a little bit so if you do want that with more intense blue like your Jolly Rancher go ahead and add a little bit more blue food coloring it's just exactly what I'm gonna do here so you took the one out of much just one drop will make one to two drops at the mouth you can see the difference there with one drop me get that mixed in so that's a much nicer blue how well you can see that so I skip it too much then it's gonna I'm gonna spill it and not like we haven't seen me see me do that before so we want to see what the color is gonna look like you just drop it onto something white there and I'll just see what it looks like so I'm happy with that color goody-goody I'm just gonna set this off to the side and we'll get our candy syrup started alright so for our candy syrup part portion we're gonna pour in our 1 cup of sugar our quarter cup of cannister up our quarter cup of light corn syrup and our quarter cup of our sorry our half a teaspoon of citric acid and our quarter cup of water and we're gonna get stirred together so you just want to get it mixed together so the water and Evert the sugar in the syrups are all incorporated and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high forever this pillar so we're going to continue to stir this until until it begins to boil then if you have any duty sugar sugar sugar sugar crystals are so acceptance I just want to scrape that off or get a pastry brush and hot water and just wash down the stop then as soon as your syrup begins to boil you're going to stop stirring and we're going to watch your candy thermometer and we're going to cook the syrup to 260 degrees Fahrenheit and that's it just the letter go now periodically don't forget about your jelly the gelatin and your candy syrup you want to go around and stir that because it we can do start to solidify around the edges if it's like to pull off too much solid once once go around and just make sure that it's all still doing good but don't worry it'll get remelted once it gets out we added into the hot candy syrup whose life my candy almost up to temperature once you hit 260 you want to remove it from your meat immediately keep the candy thermometer attached because you want to wait until the syrup comes down to about 240 before we add in our other mixture the best is that you have a stone or marble surface to put it on is the best thing it draws the heat out quickly and and it doesn't get the surface doesn't get hot at all if not just put it off to the side burner and wait until your heat comes down to 240 all right so now my temperatures come down remove your candy thermometer grab your can you stir up your gelatin and your Jolly Rancher syrup and now we're going to gently pour it into our candy pot candy syrup here it'll probably bubble up a little bit and then you want to gently mix this and and continue stirring until it's all combined and you want to try to stir it gently to incorporate as little air MIDI as little air bubbles as you can but we need to make sure everything gets stirred there we go and once you're all good with air we're gonna get this poured into our bottles or you're just gonna use your dispensers your little eye droppers so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to pour it through a little strainer this isn't necessary if you've got one great if not don't worry about it so because it gets so hot these gelatin may break a little bit you get that little bit of whiteness I can't really turn the pot that way for you but if you do you can run it through a strainer just so that doesn't get in and if not no worries it'll all kind of go up to the top I'm just gonna pour this in I don't want any left in here now one thing you can do is you can fill up if you want to know if your gelatin it's gonna set correctly is you can just set up one or two cavities in your in your candy mold put it in the fridge and it should start to solidify very fairly quickly within about five minutes or so it should start to set so you'll know if it's still really gooey and tacky then you may have difficult study let it leave it for twenty if after twenty minutes it's still not setting then the gelatin has gotten too hot or it is not it's not some notch Ellington's are all the same strength so it may not be strong enough you can remelt you can add that back into the pot and add in about another half a tablespoon more of gelatin so this way it saves you a lot of time and this has got to cool down anyway because it the bottles are too hot to handle even if I use the oven mitt you don't want to do it when it's super hot because what will happen is it'll warp your bottle and it'll screw them up so one of those will end up leaking on you so you don't want to do that so while my bottles are all that while I'm waiting for my syrup to call I threw a couple into the fridge so I'm gonna see how they're gonna set up now I wasn't setting you may find your bottles because the bubbles will start to come to the top and instead if any gelatinous broke them out White's gonna come to the top as well so what you can just do is get a little spoon and just scrape that tops kind of skin right off of there oh yeah that way it's not gonna end up into your candy and make it muddled want to have a nice clearer looking syrup all right so I did check my candies they are starting to set up nicely because the syrup is hotter it's taking them longer and I don't want to leave this get too cold so yeah so the velocity is really you just distribute it into the molds if it's still a little hot for your hands full you can use paper towels on it which is exactly what I'm gonna do cuz that's too small just hold up some paper towel to put around it I thought I don't go with the oven mitts because I find that they're heavy and clunky and that's it just disperse it into your molds and put them in the fridge for about two hours for them to fully set and I'll come back we'll pop these out to see what these bad boys looked and chase like I tasted the syrup and oh my god it's so good it tastes just like a jolly rancher now if you find that your candies don't set you put them in the fridge for two hours they come out and they're still sticky you can't get them out of the mold don't panic put them into the freezer let them freeze up for a couple of hours let me get good and frozen and then pop them out so I don't you have to do one mold at a time take them out one at a time pop them into a double boiler remelt it add another half a tablespoon to a tablespoon will be good enough bloom gelatin and that will fix that problem and the same thing if you you've gone you've made them set them up and they're just way too jelly they're very very jelly to sick you can still you remem and add in a little bit about a quarter of a cup of liquid and that should take care of that all right so I will be back when these are set and we'll pop them out and see how pretty they look all right so welcome back here so my gummies I have them sitting in the fridge just over two hours and now we're gonna take them out so as you see first it looks like they're gonna be sticky but you just got to pull around the sides and we'll start to pull away as long as they're doing that and you can pull them out you're good you're gonna slay them on your parchment paper or stand them up if you can some of your candies molds are able to stand up others won't so I bought these guys on their sides and then also when it's warm especially it's warm I only take out one or two molds at a time to take them out and leave the rest of the fridge so that they don't warm up too much if I don't have a hard time getting them out of the molds and then I'm just gonna let these little guys dry for 24 to 48 hours and they'll be good to go yeah if there is still a little bit sticky once you've dried them you can toss them in a little bit of cornstarch so you don't want to do too much usually what I'll do just coat my hands in them and then run my coat my hands and cornstarch and then just run my hands through the candy and just kind of get a very light coating on them the other thing is you could do the same thing with oil so if you want to just take some cooking water olive oil coat your hands to them rub it in and then just gently go over your candies look at a little bit of an oil that will help them to stop from sticking as well and there you've got it Jolly Rancher canna gummies look at that baby and these guys taste so good oh I tried one earlier I don't know if I'm gonna get these to drying time get them fully dried they're so good but anyway guys that's it for that tutorial I'll be back to say goodbye and yeah that's about it oh one thing is gonna tell you so if you tried taking them out of the molds and they weren't coming out they're too sticky as I said don't panic put them in the freezer let them freeze up for a couple of hours pop them out put them into a double boiler let them melt down again and then bloom a quarter or sorry a half a tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of liquid blue matte add that in and that will take care of that problem recast them and you should be good that's awesome thing we working with gelatin and the either if there is a mistake you can usually fix it as long as you haven't burnt it oh and remember that this version of the recipe is just for playing gummies we are not going to sugar or citric acid these if you do they're going to melt I will do another version of the Jolly Ranchers of the sour version for you okay so don't add your sugar and citric acid to this they will melt so that is my tutorial on a can of Jolly Rancher gummies I hope you enjoyed that and if you have any questions as always please don't hesitate to put them in the comments and as I said in the beginning of the video in case you just skipped right over it use four tablespoons of gelatin versus three and a half it'll make that little bit of difference or a little bit softer than I probably would have liked but if you like a softer gummy go the screen 1/2 but if you want that more firm gummy go with the four and you'll be good to go check out that baby's its see-through ish it's got that clear candy looking it tastes just like a jolly rancher it's so good so please let me know if you give this a try I'd love to hear from you on which flavor you prefer and once again thanks so much for watching you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "Tjqix5Vmy8s": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to the dude gross today I'm gonna be showing you what I've been doing a lot lately and that's making gummies with the magical butter machine there's pretty much two steps making the oil and then making the gummies so yeah hang out take a look to get started we need an infused oil coconut oil is whatever researched it would be the best for gummies so you basically need coconut oil cannabis soy lasts 10 or sunflower less 10 and that's all you need to get your your infused oil started there's a couple different ways to infuse your oil I went with this magical butter machine which I will link in the description and that's pretty much just set it and forget it kind of set up the diet on the first thing that we need to do is D carve our cannabis I'm going to use about an ounce of trim and D carb that going into the oven in 250 degrees for about 30 to 40 minutes what that does is actually breaks down the THC a and converts it to THC a psychoactive drug in cannabis it's an extremely important step to do if you don't do that before making your oil you're probably gonna have a much weaker soil too in future comes with the recipe for the magical butter machine is 2 cups of oil per 1 tablespoon of Weston so the sunflower lustin I had 2 tablespoons of soy Allah southern flower less attendant with 2 cups of coconut oil and then all the 1 ounce of d carb cannabis coconut oil has a melting point of 76 degrees so if it's cooler than that where your kitchen is it's gonna be hard so you basically just gotta put it over a saucepan or put it in some hot water and then it will melt right up so you can actually use the oil and the magical and that's it oils easy just take it out strain it and then you have your infused oil let's get to making the actual gummies for the recipe I'm going to show you here we're gonna use 1/2 cup of infused oil 1 6 ounce box of jell-o whatever flavor you like a half cup of water and three packs of this Knox gelatin I also put in about a half of a teaspoon or tablespoon of the sunflower less than two but it acts as a multiplier and makes it a the gummy bears a lot more firm and not oily after that would just mix together everything as the e kicks up and I like to go out a medium high heat until it gets to like a little rolling boil and once it hits that point I just continue miss mixing it and then take the heat back down to low pretty much with one or two on your dial and you are pretty much good to go after that point you don't want to pour into your molds too quickly if you do it when it's still really hot you get a lot of spillover so having it harden up just a little bit really helps out there's two ways of getting into your molds these little droppers that come with all these silicone molds I'll link that in the description as well or you can just put it into a like horror cup thing and just pour it directly into the molds - depending on how big the molds are sometimes that's an easier way [Music] once we have oliver molds filled we just put the silicone molds into the freezer for about 20 to 30 minutes might take an hour in the fridge but either way works then take them out the freezer and pop them right out some people say use some cooking spray on the silicone molds I did that once but they kind of came out oily so the first ones I used I didn't like that they were kind of coated in oil I kind of fixed that by putting them into some sugar and then into a jar just kind of sugar coated I'm shook it up and let them breathe for a little while in a few days they were okay generally I would say after that I did not use any kind of cooking spray on the molds and they still came out pretty easy so I don't think who can spray isn't nearly as important as some other people might and that's it we have gummies I like to let them breathe a little bit where because they do kind of have a bit of an oily texture to them they still are firm they're fine outside of the fridge but I like to just let them out on some wax paper in the fridge for a few days and they just kind of dry up and are a lot better texture after a couple days of curing I just put in some baggies I leave them in the fridge but you don't really have to they're good a room temperature yeah we're good to go after that pretty easy stuff you can get really creative too like don't just follow this recipe or whatever are the recipes you want I mean instead of water use orange juice in a pineapple flavored gelatin mix up your oil use the stronger the oil the better if you can use the less of it that's great you're just basically adding that cannabis infused oil into an already like a gummy recipe so the more coconut oil you add to it the worse the taste is I would say but yeah get creative with it have fun with it and yeah get weird that's it for today let me know if you have any questions or comments or anything I love talking to you guys here and what you guys do what I might be doing dumb or what you guys

Liz this is the first time you're joining if you're a regular subscriber thank you so much and welcome back so today I'm going to be doing a sugar-free can of butter gummy candy recipe that's mouthful uh and so for all those people who diabetic or don't like sugar or on a healthier on a healthier version this is a healthier version of a gummy bear for you so I don't really have much more to say all the instructions and everything or coming forward so what about further ado we'll just get started okay so what we're going to need for our sugar-free cannabutter gummy candies is three tablespoons or three envelopes of unflavored gelatin one box of sugar-free jell-o for our liquids you can either just use real lemon juice you could use these flavored waters that have no sugar or any juice that has no sugar at it and you can just use water and for additional sweetness we can add in some honey or you're gonna need a half a teaspoon of gorga a half a teaspoon of citric acid a quarter to a third of a cup of canned butter melted can of butter and if you want additional colors or flavors you can add those in as well you can use the the oil base or the gel based flavors the equipment that you're going to need obviously your mold whatever molds you want to use a double boiler if you don't have a double boiler any pot small pot and metal bowl that fits you know you don't want it to touch the bottom so you want it to have enough room and that you can do a makeshift double boiler you're gonna need a bowl for blooming your gelatin something to disperse your syrup so you can knead these bottles are great because they've got these tips these piping tips on them which makes it really nice for dispersing however any squeeze bottle or dropper will work measuring spoon a lips a hand blender if you don't have a hand blender a whisk and a very strong forearm and that's about everything obviously spatula and I think that's everything that we need to get started so we'll put all the ingredients together and go over the measurements so the first things that we need to do is we're going to turn our heat on to the lowest we just want to get the water hot once it's hot you can turn it off and next we are going to bloom our gelatin so you're going to need 1/2 a cup of your liquid and three tablespoons of your gelatin you want to evenly sprinkle it over the top and then you want to make sure to stir it in then stir it up so that there's no lumps and then you're going to set that aside for five minutes to let it bloom next you're going to take a quarter cup of your liquid and you're going to microwave it for a minute or minute and 20 seconds until boiling your going to add your sugar free jello to your double boiler and you're going to add that quarter cup of boiled liquid in and you're going to stir it up until your gelatin or - your jello is dissolved and while that's melting if you want to this is when you can you would add in two tablespoons of honey if you want to add some additional sweetness to it now if you don't like the taste of honey I'm gonna say don't do it because you are gonna have that bitter taste of honey pour it in it and you also want to add in a half a teaspoon of citric acid try not to get it on your spoon like I just did you actually want it in the pot and you'll just continue to stir that gently until everything is dissolved now that everything is dissolved we can add in our unflavored gelatin so what I like to do is time to split it up in the bowl like this so it's all in pieces and it it'll dissolve quicker and you're just going to stir that in until that is completely melted now this should be warm enough to melt the gelatin but if you find that it isn't melting you can put it back on the heat for a few minutes so I had to add mine back on the heat there because it wasn't melt melting it was actually starting to solidify so I'm just got that back on the heat so that it's melting now if you've got a bunch of jell-o and gelatin stuff stuck around the sides and you can't get it off but you can just use is hot hot water and a brush then you can just easily then wash it off wash it down into the pot now that everything is melted and all dissolved now we can add in our canna butter and our Garg um so just dump in your butter your can of butter actually add in 1/2 a teaspoon of Garga now if you have one of these little strainers it's great because you can use it makes it eat nice to just evenly distribute across the top if not just try and make sure you kind of sprinkle evenly across the top of it and once all that's on you're gonna let it sit for a minute and then we're gonna get our trusty little hand blender or our whisk and now we'll get our trusty hand blender and start blending [Applause] [Music] once you're fully mixed you just want to let stir it gently so we can start to work out some of those air bubbles and we're just gonna let it sit for a couple of minutes now at this point once everything's done and incorporated if you want to add in any additional flavor or color this is when you can do it so I'm just gonna add in a little bit more red to up that red a bit and I get this no taste red because I hate the test a taste of red food coloring and Wilton's makes this no taste red which is great the only problem is is it doesn't really give you the same intensity red as the regular red does but I'd rather forsake a little bit of the color for the taste because I really don't like that kind of bitter taste that red has and next I you can use ready to pour into your bottle or you can just use your eyedropper to distribute it into your molds and we're just gonna do that next and now you just distribute into the molds and the things you don't want to fill up the mold all the way you want to just leave it a little bit of the a little bit of the edge there otherwise it creates a sharp edge on your candies so and and it tends to dry out so it's not very it doesn't make it very nice so you want to keep it just below the below the top and once you fill up your molds you're gonna put it into the fridge for 20 to 40 minutes or until they're set another thing you want to try to pour right into the center of the mold and let it distribute it I know some of them you can't they have to be little feet or legs or tails but if you can otherwise the reason is again it's not it causes it won't stick to the sides and cause that edge and if you've made these before and have done it to the top you have that kind of sharp rigid edge that always dries out and it just doesn't make your candy very pleasant that's the reason all right so I'm gonna put these into the fridge to set by the feel of it it feels pretty like it's already starting to set so probably 20 minutes is all they're gonna need now if you want your candies to have a go back to the clear more clear looking what you can do is just put it on to the heat on low heat for a few minutes and the air bubbles and that will work out and it'll go back to that clear that clear look all right so they've been studying for 20 minutes they're ready to come out now so what you want to do is lay some parchment paper down on a wire rack what I like to do is I like to poke holes into my parchment paper so that way I can get air coming up through the bottom as well just hit this with driving don't have to is just something that I do and you're just gonna stand your little gummies up if you can some will stand some won't that's it you're gonna just leave them out to dry for anywhere from 24 to 48 hours there's your gummies your sugar-free gummies see there's one that we let's that I let sit on the heat for a little while let the air bubbles come out of it and that's it there you go sugarfree gummy bears cannabutter sugarfree gummy bears gotta make that clear all right let's get one of these little bad boys a try so just like a regular gummy bear or gummy candy no difference there okay all right tastes really good so it's really going to be dependent your taste be a big factor on the liquid that you use so you definitely want to use something that does have a lot of flavor or definitely your favorite juice no sugar added juice probably those nectars are good again if you're diabetic I'm not sure about that sugar contact I know there's not extra sugar added but I don't know how much regular sugar like natural sugars are in there if that's good or not but that may be an option as well if you do though use a nectar or any kind of real fruit juice I would recommend using mold inhibitor lorraine's makes a mold inhibitor that you can order online you may be able to get it in your specialty store and if you're using any type of real juice or real fruits in your gummies all

[Music]", "_KOUuNB0N9M": "[Music] what's up everybody Alex from uncanny here and today I want to talk to you about the difference between full-spectrum broad-spectrum and isolate based CBD hemp extracts [Music] I get this question all the time and it is honestly a pretty confusing topic people throw these phrases around without really knowing what they mean but today I'm gonna tell you exactly the difference between the three so first let's just talk about what this spectrum really is in full spectrum a broad spectrum and the spectrum really refers to the different compounds that are in the natural extract so when you think of a CBD oil it's not just CBD that's in that oil there's different fats there's different terpenes potentially different cannabinoids and other things that create the full picture and so in that sense a full spectrum product would be just that it has the entire full spectrum of naturally occurring compounds that are found in that extract so on the totally other side of the spectrum would be what's considered an isolate and as that sounds it's the CBD that's been stripped away and isolated from all the other naturally occurring compounds in that extract and then in the middle between an isolate and a full-spectrum extract you have the whole range of broad spectrum and as that sounds it doesn't necessarily have the full set of compounds but it has a lot of them or most of them for example at uncanny wellness we remove the THC from our products so that is technically part of the spectrum which is why we don't call ours a full spectrum extract instead it's a broad spectrum extract so it has the CBD it has the terpenes the flavonoids and all those other naturally occurring compounds in the extract a common misconception that people have is that you need THC in order for CBD to work properly there is some truth in that because THC and CBD work synergistically together but you don't need the THC for the CBD to work going off of that something like an isolate would work it just doesn't work necessarily as well as a full spectrum product so full spectrum is going to have apps everything in it as such if you remove any part of that spectrum whether you're removing the THC or even if you're distilling down and concentrating what's in the extract you're getting into the territory of broad spectrum so really most of what's out there in the market is gonna be a broad spectrum and not a full spectrum because full is just a very absolute phrase and as a natural result of the processing and extraction and refinement in to that final product form you do lose certain parts of that spectrum another important thing to understand is that the spectrum a full spectrum broad spectrum directly relates to what's known as the entourage effect and the entourage effect basically says that when you have CBD in conjunction with the other naturally occurring compounds that it's usually found with it has a greater amplified effect versus an isolate which is just CBD has no entourage has no other components of the spectrum and is less effective than a full or broad spectrum product so you can kind of think of it like there's more entourage effect happening the more full the spectrum is and as you start taking things away you're removing naturally-occurring compounds from that spectrum you're losing members of the entourage and over time you go all the way to an isolate format which has no entourage effects happening whatsoever the nice thing about a broad spectrum extract is that you can do something like THC removal which is what we do and that's nice for people that may have to get drug tested or just don't want any trace THC in their system or maybe they want to give it to their kids or a pet or they're a pilot or any reason like that they can still enjoy the benefits of the entourage effect and of a broad spectrum CBD extract without having any residual THC because the legal limit for hemp products is 0.3 percent THC so a full spectrum product could have at most 0.3% but you could easily remove that making a broad spectrum or end up removing everything for an isolate for most people the best option for a CBD product is going to be a full or broad spectrum extract isolates are kind of the pharmaceutical reduction of CBD it strips it away from everything else reducing its holistic nature and making it more controllable as such isolates are the cheapest form of CBD available and a lot of times people will actually just throw isolate into a product to make it a really high milligram count and then end up charging you more even though you're getting a lesser quality product so when you're out there trying to figure out which CBD product is best for you it's fair to either ask the company or look for where it says it on the label to see is it isolate broad spectrum or full spectrum and that should help you decide exactly what you're looking for so in summary on one end you have an absolutely full spectrum product that's gonna have the most other compounds besides CBD and it's going to have the most entourage effect on the other end you have an isolate where the CBD is stripped away from all the other naturally naturally occurring compounds there are no extra compounds in the extract and there's going to be no entourage effect and then in the middle you would have the range of broad-spectrum extracts that don't have all the naturally occurring compounds but have most of them and you're still getting the benefits of the entourage effect because of the turbines the flavonoids the polyphenols and all of the other array of compounds that are naturally present in a CBD hemp extract so that's it that's the breakdown between full spectrum and broad spectrum and isolate thank you so much for watching if you enjoyed this video please give it a like leave a comment down below if you want to share your thoughts and make sure to share this with friends so that they can understand the difference between these three forms of CBD as well that's all for today see you next time peace [Music]", "pRQQqKUyIro": "[Music] hello my name is Jennifer Dixon with the green valley nation and today I want to give you a really quick review on the Charlotte's Web maximum strength CBD this is a highly concentrated product that claims to be great for sports recovery folks suffering from anxiety issues and insomnia and sleep related issues Charlotte's Web grows and processes all of their hemp in Colorado they use organic non-gmo and vegan friendly products to make a full spectrum CBD using co2 extraction methods the Charlotte's Web maximum strength CBD comes in chocolate mint flavor it has 60 milligrams of CBD per each suggested serving size of one milliliter there are two current sizes which are 30 milliliter and 100 milliliter which gives you at least in this bottle eighteen hundred milligrams and then in the 100 milliliter bottle it gives you 6,000 milligrams of CBD because this is a full-spectrum product there is a little bit of THC in it but it's less than 0.3 percent and so it won't get you high let's talk about the packaging on the outside of both the box and the bottle is a picture of the Rocky Mountains a kind of tribute to where they are located and on the outside of the box is a QR code it's on the bottom right hand side that you can scan and get the analysis and the information about the particular product you'll find that each bottle inside of the box is individually wrapped with cellophane so that you know that it's new and that it has the ingredients and it has the suggested serving size of one milliliter because this is a full spectrum oil you'll notice that it is a little bit darker and greener in color than an ISIL it might be that also means that the flavor is going to be a little stronger now Charlotte's Web does use a chocolate mint flavor in this product but that doesn't necessarily mean it covers up all of the flavors let's try it you're gonna put it underneath your tongue and you want to hold it for at least 30 to 60 seconds the first thing that you're gonna notice after taking this product is that even though it is supposed to be chocolate mint flavored it doesn't taste super chocolaty just a little bit minty you're gonna still taste the plant it's a it's a full spectrum product so it definitely has that plant flavor to it however within 15 minutes you're gonna notice that you're calmer that you can focus a little better and that if you have any residual pain because it's so concentrated this stuff knocks it out pretty well now for me I'm very sensitive and I react very very quickly and strongly to CBD so I don't need very much I use like a few drops maybe a quarter of a dropper full and that will last me all day for you if you are a little less sensitive to it or you are dealing with a higher amount of anxiety or pain you might have to use the full suggested serving size of one milliliter and it may not last you all day you might have to take this every four to six hours it really just depends on how your body reacts and responds to it and then how quickly it metabolizes the CBD you can also find that when you take this before bed it'll help you to relax and go to sleep I find that when I take it before sleeping it puts me to bed like that and then I can sleep the whole night which is glorious let's talk value here this is considered a premium product so it is definitely on the higher end of the price spectrum if this is not something that you're generally as concerned about then it's a perfect product for you however if you live on a pretty tight budget this could be a difficult addition to your daily routine if flavor is also a big thing for you this might not be the best option because it definitely does still have a strong earthy plant flavor there is a hint of but if you're very sensitive to taste in flavors then I would definitely not recommend this product for you overall I really do like the the Charlotte's Web maximum strength CBD oil it does what it says it's supposed to do help you to relax it definitely helps me to sleep and it definitely does help to manage my aches and pains I can't recommend it if you are looking for something that is on a budget because this is a little bit more on the higher end of the spectrum but it is a great product high quality every single time I take it it's the exact same and if you're not as sensitive to flavors it's going to get the job done pretty quickly because it's so concentrated so you might not need as much thank you so much for taking the time to watch this review once again my name is Jennifer Dixon with greenvalley nation and if you liked it make sure you subscribe to this channel for the most comprehensive library of hemp products thanks again see you soon bye bye [Music]", "HU89Aijiz7A": "Hey guys! Welcome back to the Remedy\nReview channel. Today, I'm going to be going over my top three favorite CBD\ngummies of all time. So, the first of our three CBD gummies up here is literally\nfrom Seabedee. Yeah, play on words, fun name. I love their branding and their products,\nespecially their neon gummy bears. They also have some peach rings that are\nreally great, but I like these just because you get more of them in the pack,\nand they're all multicolored, different flavors, and they just taste really\nreally amazing. They kind of have a little bit of a sour coating, and they\ntaste better than probably every other regular just gummy bear I've ever tried!\nAnd they're THC free, and they have 10 milligrams in each gummy, so I'm just\ngonna open this real quick just kind of show you what they look like, and\nprobably just take one for myself. Devon you might have to...Oh, I got it! Okay, alright, okay.\nI'm definitely gonna try a blue one 'cause that's like one of my favorites. But look\nat how cute this is! It's...it's like the perfect shape of a bear. Anyway... Can you hear the ASMR chewing? So, next up\nwe have cbdMD. These are their 750 milligram gummies for the whole bottle,\nso there's 25 milligrams per gummy. They also have a couple different strengths -\none that's lower, like 300 for one bottle which is 10 milligrams each, and the\nsuper-strong one that's kind of newer that has 50 milligrams per gummy. So, if\nyou're really looking for something strong, they have it at cbdMD. Yeah, these\nare also made with broad spectrum CBD so they're THC free! And they have assorted\nflavors of like strawberry, tropical, raspberry, orange. Yeah, they taste really\ngood also. Should I try one? I'm just I wasn't gonna try all these but now I'm\njust here and they smell kind of good. They smell really good! But these I kind of use just on a daily basis...if they're...if I'm at work or\nsomething they definitely stay on my work desk. So, if I need a little a little\nsomething extra to help me calm down when I'm stressed during the work week,\nthese are what I reach for. And then last but not least, at the end of the day I'm\na big fan of these MedTerra CBD gummies. They're actually a new release,\ndefinitely the new kid on the block out here, but I really like them already.\nThese are strawberry flavored, and they also have other ingredients to help you\nsleep like chamomile, and lemon balm, and just a little bit of melatonin - not\nenough to make you go groggy in the morning, but just overall all of the\ningredients in here kind of work together to just help you get a restful\nnight's sleep. So, that's what I really like to use them for. Oh, yeah, I mean they\nhave a very strong strawberry scent but I love that because strawberry is really\nfun. They're also definitely the squishiest out of the bunch, yeah, but I\nmean they're gummies! Oh sh*t. I probably shouldn't have taken that because\nit's a sleep gummy but whatever. It's fine. It's Thursday... it's almost Friday. Still good though! At this point... That was...yeah, I probably shouldn't have done that. But I just wanted to really... anyway thanks for\nwatching! Alright! So, I'm about to go take a nap! and I... So, all in all, these three CBD\ngummies are just kind of my personal favorites, but if you guys have any other\ntop brands that you really like, any of their gummies or edibles in general\nplease share with us in the comments below! And if you've tried any of these\nand really liked them or even if you didn't like them, please let us know as\nwell!

keep contacting us and tell us to sell their product it's the best there's so much confusion out there we wanted to start this channel to let you know what we keep seeing customers come back and buy what they tell us works for sleep anxiety pain insomnia they don't like gummies they want a solution for capsules they they're not into capsules they like oils they like oils but what's the difference between broad spectrum and full spectrum what's MCT oils but we wanted to put together a station that we could try and make these live streams and explain a little bit about CBD explain to you the differences the options you have for all different types and we're gonna go into it right now just give us a second change screens over here this is our youtube station where we're making different videos for full-spectrum oils MCT oils broad spectrum and they might look like ads to you guys but they really used to call out products our customers love and keep buying from us we try to make

you could use the top nav shop here it is just clicked yes you could shop look at all the products go through oil tinters and only look at those same thing for capsules etc had products edibles topicals it's gone back to edibles it's a very large category so we tried to make it simple for the people that want to buy vegan edibles people that can eat gluten sorry they're in certain products and need kosher certification or halal certification we found gummies in our lines that we see customers buying that they like that tastes great that worked great aim thing for gluten-free if you have a gluten free diet we did that and if you want to find Pacific uses we went ahead and made a sleep section so skipping over all of this we could go quickly to talking a little bit about the differences on edibles what different types of edibles are there what ones are available and we're going to play a short clip and then you could talk about [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] sunstate hem here they are on the site you could go very easily to the edible section or better yet from the homepage if you were on the home page you could click here to go to the home page and you wanted to shop by brand and you went down towards the bottom and just say for example chose sunstate that's how I got to that page and I'm sorry I'm being a little repetitive for those of you that are quicker than others but not everyone is of the same age demographic ties we see so these were the penguin gummies they're great for sleep you just saw the video same thing for the fruit slices they have melatonin and you saw all the other great ones from sour apple peach blue raspberry sour packs and bears this video is on YouTube but look at the different options we're gonna play another quick strip of videos for other edibles just to give

your average CBD capsule that you see in your CBD store your vitamin shop online these were specifically formulated for four different types of uses to relax and fall asleep you've got to sleep capsules and then you have for energy if your that's the one we just played need a boost of energy any time of the day these things are great let's take two of them and then they make a stress and a relief for inflammation all four of these are available on monthly supplies and daily doses for just five dollars each and we're going to back to the video and show you the other capsules that are available [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] but we also have two more capsules and just to stay on the line with you guys over here before we play the other videos for the capsules I want to let you know what's coming up after the capsules it'll be CBD oils the different types of oils will go over MCT oils won't go over broad-spectrum and even full-spectrum and we'll even show you

1000 milligram tincture will have 500 milligrams of CBD and 500 milligrams of CBG if you clicked on read more you'll see all the details you could scroll down and go as crazy as you want with the

[Music]", "VeZ79z78neg": "hello so today I'm gonna talk about the Orange County CBD gummies absolutely love CBD gummy bears so I was really excited triose I've tried about eight different brands so far and I have to be honest with you this is my favorite one one of the first things you'll notice as well is they come with all different types of textures and if you can see but there's like a soft sugar coating to it also unlike some upper ones they do actually taste different each one my favorite is actually the blue one couldn\u00b4t table salt there is ten milligrams of board sectin CBD in each and every gummy bear they recommend between three to eight gummies meaning 30 to 80 milligrams of CBD per day depending on what you prefer um I like to have it first thing in the morning because I don't really want sugar before going to bed so I normally have a CBD oil before going to sleep and it got me first thing in the morning enough for highlight is these are actually vegan friendly so they contain no gelatin because is around forty pounds for the ten milligram CBD pack without actually know the exact number of gummy bears you get in here but I think it's about 50 so it's a lot more than usual tub you'd get with this kind of brands best-before has a nice long two-year date on it so I've had some sent to me where you've only got a month left on it Martin cannot express how nice these taste it's really hard not to have more than one that's all I hope you found that useful bye", "CYUcoFmFx-Q": "hi welcome to 'angels anything show and we're back on another great butt hole of a February day but there is one shining light on this February day and that is this video and what we're about to do that is we are making weed gummies whoa that's right we've made brownies we made cookies we made chocolates we made maple syrup which that was questionable I think that worked but we have not made the quintessential lead food which is weed gummies now I'm a little nervous for this video because when you're  around with candy there's a lot less room for error and there's you know big risks on the table here this is quite a bit of weed so we're here I have the setup of what we need but really we're going to be going back there for the majority of this video to the oven I'm assuming you have a whisk I'm assuming you have a little pot I'm assuming you have water that's it those are the things you probably already have now hopefully you also have weed and hopefully you know how to make it into cannabutter because I'm not about to go over that with you I have my fancy towel here that my sister got me for Christmas it says the food has wheat in it and in this house that's probably true you're gonna need sunflower lecithin I think that's how it said this one is like a heavy all national cold press Papa bah a link to this specific one in the description box in fact all of this info will be in the description box below because I'm not a reliable source now on to the slightly grosser ingredients gelatin this is basically like horse hooves sorry and then jello which is more horse Hope's exciting but this will give us the you know candy flavor the recipe I'm using is from this place called the canna school and then their recipe they say use a half cup of water but then in the comments people were like it actually works better or tastes better if you use a half a cup of fruit juice just has a little bit of a flavor so let me show you what I got so fruit juice is definitely not my area of expertise so first I got power eat fruit punch in this tastes like medicine so I don't want it and I'm gonna have to like throw it out this isn't nobody's gonna drink it and so then I went and I got v8 splash berry blend I just want something that's like a nice sugary drink that's not like gross you know but it's actually really hard to find let's see that's exactly what I'm going part  Dan we were at the store yesterday and I was like trying so hard to pick out a juice that was good and I'm not well-versed in juices like I said and he was like that's gonna crop sex to me gross no Michael what about this he's like what are you grandpa like it's not the tomato based ones they're her bunch okay so oh and the final thing that you need is obviously mold no you don't actually have to use gummy bears you can use whatever you want but I want to use gummy bears because if I'm traveling with this I want to go to disguise them as I get a candy this recipe makes about a hundred gummies small ones weak ones I want big strong ones so I got the cutest gummy mold it's like the medium size so this is by the modern gummy and they had a small size of medium size and then a larger size and there are like 36 of these in here or 38 so really all that's left now is to go over to the stove and mix all this together and the reason it's a little scary is because oh and I have to heat this up too but the reason it's scary is because we're cooking sugar and candy and if you I have to do whisking it as I mean as I'm squirting it into this so time is of the essence you know so let me get us all situated over there and we'll begin alright guys I have everything all set up my station is ready because once we start this process you really got to keep it moving I have to whisk this liquid for like 15 minutes non-stop as we go so I'm gonna do my best to kind of like show you guys but this might get intense I don't know and I don't know I'm trying to make this video funny but it's probably not gonna be funny because I don't want to joke around and then up my edibles that ain't gonna happen so we're gonna stick to the script today okay I'm attaching you guys to this which is actually um for the car but it works on the oven so we're getting creative here and you're gonna see a little aerial view of what's going down my dog is like you when you're gonna take me for a walk well we need to medicate first little Jimmy we need to medicate hey it's a girl Angie KB I'm gonna tell you what I'm doing step by step so first you turn this stove on to medium low add in the cannabis butter add in your soy lecithin powder and start stirring rigorously and then once that's combined you add in the fruit punch as you're choosing and then you add in the gelatin and you've got a like whisk a lot as you're doing this or else it'll get all clumpy kind of like cornstarch you know and you know just whisking away whisking away oh then you add in your jello powder you can see in the background my dog licking his dick so that's nice it's getting a little clumpy okay so then you just whisk for like 10-15 minutes and then I started filling up these molds which took a while I ended up switching to a spoon which is easier but yeah that's basically it [Music] all right guys the deed is done I don't know how I feel about the fact that I got some of this on me and you literally can play with it like special effects makeup and it's not coming off but tasty sense so mmm horse hooves that was pretty easy it did get a little tricky with the hardening but they acted online as if like oh my god it's gonna harden in like two seconds so I know I think that I did all right I lost the dropper like halfway through it just got too thick and it like clogged and it didn't work and then I just ended up using a spoon from my cabinet which made it a little messier but I think ultimately a lot faster so now these are just gonna set it says to put them in the freezer but then I saw people saying that they were better left out so I think I'm gonna do what you would do with normal jello and just put them in the fridge I don't know I'll let them set for a few hours and then I guess we'll taste test one right I guess so all right guys it's hours later and these things are set they're dumb this is how these came out they look pretty legit and then I had a little bit of excess left so I just pour it in here you know I haven't popped any of these out but let's see I'm impressed with myself these came out really good like normally I do a really bad job with this stuff but let's do the taste test so I'm just gonna eat this big one because yeah mmm mmm all right little gelatin II I mean it doesn't taste awesome cuz I can taste a lot of the coconut oil but I mean you know I'm not eating this cuz I  want candy you know I mean this cousin trying to get my rocks off so if you're trying to get your rocks off try this recipe you try one of the you saw I mean yeah boo tastes awesome cuz it's like very coconut oil II it's not bad it's just like you kind of want to get it over with is it a fail I don't think so I mean I guess we'll find out if it gets me high it's not a fail you know it's edible thank God we use that fruit punch stuff because I don't know how it tasted without back umm-hmm right no all right guys but that's it what do you think it was actually really easy hopefully very effective we'll see I'll let you know remember the recipe link will be below I'll also link where I got the soy lecithin powder stuff and follow me on Instagram if you want Angie Kb thank you for watching this episode of 'angels anything show and I'll see you next time good bye [Music] alright I'm here to report that the gummies worked thus laylee to gelatinous gummies did indeed work I am hi and also I have a pimple between my eyes which I've had for this whole video so you guys already know that anyway it was a success so definitely make them alright also Dan just up a Hello fresh alright guys more time has passed and they feel they need to tell you that I'm even more up now as you can probably tell because my eyelid is even more closed and my pimple is even more red so I'm not sure what's happening - then no okay don't do try these at home do you tres know Dan's rolling a great bodysuit [Music]", "-oohjzQjDMs": "so to begin you're going to need your bare molds your dropper a knife a spoon a whisk if you're using gelatin you'll want to get out your gelatin if you're using jello get off your jello packet if you're using gelatin you probably want flavoring like mayo a half tea of mayo a third of a cup of water you'll want to have your cbd isolate also a sensitive scale and a ziploc bag to put on top now you'll want to spray your molds with non-stick pam or other oil this is a third of a cup of water and half a tablespoon of mayo now what you're going to want to do is slowly mix in the gelatin to prevent it from clumping so we're going to do one tablespoon of gelatin second tablespoon of gelatin third tablespoon of gelatin you want to make sure that all the gelatin gets wet you don't want any dry gelatin and then i'm going to add roughly another half tablespoon so the consistency that you're going for is you want it to be kind of like porridge or oatmeal you want it to be thick scrape that off and now we're going to microwave this so we've microwaved this for 30 seconds you can see how it's liquidy now uh i want to get all the gels melted spoons i'm going to sort of stir it around in here i'm going to use the whisk to help scrape it off so 30 seconds you shouldn't have any trouble with the gelatin the second 30 seconds you need to watch the gelatin to make sure that it doesn't boil over in the microwave so the gelatin will start to foam and boil as soon as you see the gelatin rising go ahead and hit stop in the microwave so we're microwaving for our second 30 seconds and we're going to watch it because near the end it should start to foam and boil all right you see that it's starting to boil starting to grow just make sure it doesn't go over the bowl so we're stirring you can see the mixture is very liquidy i'm going to put that aside we're going to measure out the cbd now we're using a ziploc bag to make it easy to transfer the cbd into not gonna scale all messy so where we want two grams which happens very quickly so we're just measuring out two grams here's why you need a sensitive scale too much this should be close to two grams so you can fold the bag get it all back on the scale okay there we go 1.99 there's a little bit here that's off the scale that'll include so we've got roughly 2 grams put that directly into the cbd get a little bit off the lid and we're going to stir it in so you don't want any clumps i want everything to be uniform so we're stirring really aggressively here we want everything to be mixed in now if your gelatin is cooled you can microwave this again or if it's still fairly liquid you can start putting them into the molds just like that i like to do five at a time for each dropper and uh if it gets too solid or it gets too thick to work with just microwave it again keep an eye on it make sure that it doesn't boil over and microwave as many times as you need to keep it nice and easy to work with we've got our bear molds filled we're going to put these in the refrigerator flat for 20 minutes they're still somewhat liquid so don't lift them up or else the gelatin will fall out of the mold so keep these flat in the refrigerator for 20 minutes so it's been 20 minutes the bears are solid and now we just pop them out i used like to use a paper towel and just start pushing on the molds to pop all the bears out and they should be nice and solid they should easily come out if they don't easily come out then you didn't use enough non-stick spray in the beginning and so we just pop all the bears out if there's any little dots like this on the mold you can just pull that off as well and there you go 129 bears which makes each bear roughly 15.5 milligrams of cbd now you want to take these and put these in the refrigerator don't leave them out they will eventually grow mold if you leave them out for too long my last test they grew mold in roughly two weeks but if you keep them in the refrigerator they should last for months", "NNDN5tSfdk8": "[Music] hello everyone it's my cozy with CBD headquarters and today quickly in this video I

watermelon slices which you cannot resist and once you try them you'll agree so be good hello welcome to and welcome back to CBD headquarters on this special I want to teach you about buying CBD on Amazon and what to expect so first can you really buy CBD on Amazon actually you cannot buy CBD on Amazon it is a restricted product and cannot be sold on Amazon and will give you a visual right now so if you go on to Amazon and you hit say key and CBD I'll be really general there's over 7,000 results for CBD let's just take a glance these are all pink atures oil tinctures they look just like CBD tinctures but if you look closely they all say hemp oil so they're not CBD or they're remarketed as CBD it's very deceiving anyone on the front end without a little bit of an educational look at these and click you know choose their flavor choose their milligram add it to cart and buy it but as you scroll down and you see all the product that comes up when you hit CBD you'll notice they also have CBD gummies they have the CBD oil but you'll notice something distinct over here everything says hemp and not CBD so basically two things are happening over here number one you could also look at the milligrams whether it's oil tank atures or the gummies and notice that they have an awfully high milligram over here like three hundred and fifty thousand milligrams for sixty pieces of gummies I mean you're talking tons of milligrams per gummies had this been authentic information or 400,000 milligrams in gummies or half a million milligrams in a tiny little one milliliter bottle of oil so as a professional looking at this you know or manufacturers looking at this they must be saying to myself how could people be buying this junk and so am i and that's the reason why I'm here to explain that these pain creams hemp creams and gummies and tinctures that they're all talking about over here really don't do much and in fact they're going to confuse you as a user thinking I found a natural alternative remedy for pain anxiety and sleep and etc but you did not find CBD you will not be trying CBD and another thing to think about is when these companies like these are using ingredients in their products and they say they're using hemp air on the side of caution because most of the hemp in these types of products used by these types of manufacturing companies are usually filled with pesticides and used if you're a farmer and you know and you could relate that hemp is used to absorb all the metals and pesticides so that they could plant and have a healthy harvesting again so what happens is they end up with a ton of hemp and they know the CBD industry is blowing up and they go to companies and offer them these deals for this type of hemp and that's what you're putting in your body moving on if you're a seller and you tried to list you know real authentic CBD you'll get a notification restricted products removal which essentially means you know warning we're either in a suspend your account forever or you know take this as a warning and remove all those products because these products are identified as prohibited CBD or cannabis oil product I hope you all learn something today and please feel free to comment and stay tuned for more about buying CBD on Amazon [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]", "CUNw0BsIToE": "hey this is jeff from extract wellness\nand this is your five minute question answer on\nfive reasons you should try cbd gummies if you've already tried cbd oil to\nimprove your health and wellness likely your next question may be gum you\nseem fun so why wouldn't i take gummies over other forms of cbd\nlet's compare taking cbd and attention and eating gummies\nbecause there may be a few differences here are five reasons why customers\nsometimes choose gummies over other forms of cbd number one\nthey're easy to take some people have difficulties remembering to take their\ncbd on a daily basis if you're already familiar with taking\nvitamins or morning pills it may be an easier habit to integrate\ncbd gummies into your daily lifestyle versus an oil number two\nour gummies come in an assortment of fruity flavors and\nare delicious they're all vegan no animal by-products\nand they have zero bitter aftertaste number three well unfortunately in some\nsocial circles there may still be a negative social\nstigma tied to cbd oil so taking gummies is a more discreet way\nto ingest your cbd pulling one out of your pocket and\npopping into your mouth probably won't catch eyes\nat work or in public like an oil would number four the benefits of cbd last a\nlittle bit longer with gummies because of the way they're ingested they\nare metabolized through your liver versus oils that can get in your\nbloodstream sublingually that's under your tongue\nand number five it's often easier to measure\nyour dosage with gummies if a gummy has 25 milligrams of cbd\nlike ours do you know the precise dose when you eat one or two\nyou also have the option to eat a half a gummy or even a quarter of gummy\nif you're sharing with a friend or a pet that needs a different dose\nbottom line there are slight differences between the types of cbd products\nsome work faster and some last a little bit longer\nit all comes down to how you need to experience your cbd\nif you have any more questions about

review three products by Charlotte's Web have here the hemp extract infuse gummies their sleep our tincture which is their original formula mint chocolate teacher also their capsules so their head pot souls start with these sleep dummies really really liked these they are 10 milligrams apiece and they suggest that you eat to a person they are raspberry flavored which is done by eat sugar I believe some ingredients aren't too bad TTE oil fruit and vegetable juice for color so it's got 3 grams of sugar it's also got melatonin so that's what makes it so great for sleep my husband and I both tried these and we found that after taking even just one we fell asleep pretty much immediately my only issue with these is some nights that I have them I found myself falling asleep everytime perfectly but maybe not sleeping all the way through the night that could be so many different factors if your problem is falling asleep I would highly suggest these Charlotte's Web Stanley Brothers 10 milligram raspberry flavor hemp extract used gummies for sweet next up we have got their tincture so this tincture is a 50 milligram suture gluten-free non-gmo vegan made with coconut oil organic mint chocolate flavored oils four flavors it's five calories I was a little bit confused about this wrapper which doesn't actually have any limes or anything like that and so that should be one full dropper should be point 5 milliliters it's just a little confusing on like what the actual dosage is and my dropper doesn't work I don't know it came that way and I fix it so I was just kind of like taking shots off the bottle it tastes alright um it covers up kind of ahem flavor but not totally I still kind of have to wash it down with some water um one day I took kind of a pretty big swig of this and I honestly felt like I got high so I do feel like it's effective I just I'm a little confused about the dosing my dropper didn't work and it doesn't really taste that great but I do think it's effective so if you're a tincture person I would try it last but not least the capsules so they come in the little bottle like this and they're 20 milligram plant-based can I have no it's per capsule same kind of thing so the ingredients are extra-virgin olive oil and the vegetable capsule and other than that it's just extract it says to take one capsule up to two times daily I really like the capsule dose a it avoids the kind of icky flavor that a lot of tinctures love it just gets straight to the source and I thought these were very effective if I take two I definitely feel that heightened sense of like euphoria and even a little high which I don't normally feel the CVE and maybe their specific plants that they use or cannabinoid blends just works for my unknown cannabinoid system for taking one essentially you just would feel like a little calm and anti-anxiety taking - I really could actually feel the effects of CBD huge I don't usually I think they're a really great product well I was afraid about with Charlotte's Web they are kind of one of the og bigger companies now if you don't know their story started out with a really great mission to help a young girl who had severe epilepsy and so they were growing medical grade hemp before a lot of people really ever were and so they made this specific product for Charlotte and it really helps with her seizures so it's they started out beautifully they grew now into a much bigger company so I was really nervous that they their products would suffer because of their blow but I don't think that's the case of all these all seem really high quality I mean like medical grade CBD from my experience with them they were they were wonderful everybody's endocannabinoid system is different so I encourage you to look at the batch that you're getting and always check the COA but overall I was impressed I did not think I was gonna like these so much so feeling really good about that thank you for watching you can read all of our reviews and check us out at Mary Jane experience comm we're on every social media platform that there is so checks up thanks so much", "xSftr8wdzZY": "[Music] sup guys simplistic here back with another video if you can tell from the title it is another CBD video but this time it's a different CBD company that worked with before floor CBD this one's going to be wild CBD with a Y but before we start all this let's go so with CBD it's a non-psychoactive cannabinoid so we're gonna we're gonna smoke some wax you know I'm saying it's you know so we're gonna smoke some wax to start the day I just woke up as you can tell from my funky ass hair we'll be doing this I'm not gonna be showing you this wax not that much left but it's tizzy wax that you can see it already but yeah we're gonna take a quick hit of this and we're gonna start this video on this CBD stuff I've actually had for like a month now I just been meaning to uh I've been mean to do it you know I'm saying so shoot boys [Music] do you know it [Music] all right so let's get started on this CD do you need to pick up some today so you're probably gonna see a pickup video somewhere along the line to maybe take a hit that's funny farms - I mean there's barely any left over see one here high wild CBD and for those of you who've seen this brand before they actually do have a line of CBD and THC products they were able to send me the CBD parts because CBD is legal you can freely send it to anyone in the United States it is a fully legal cannabinoid you know so there's no THC up in this all the facts are ready on here I already showed you that let's just open the box so right off the bat when you open it you get like this sense of like a sense that it's like a very neat little medicine type feel you know that feels like like a premium product just being in this case right here this was pretty cool school their supplement facts all that good stuff so there's only I think there's only ten in here ten gummies all that stuff so it's 25 milligrams each which is pretty pretty much a lie I say so that's why there's only ten of them just open this up and see what all the fuss is about I guess be in the lookout for another CBD product when you review for them it is sparkling water if you guys are interested in that I'm not the biggest fan of sparkling water but I know there's a lot of people that are you know so that video might be for you you know it's another way taking in CBD without you know if you don't really want to smoke hemp or or dab CBD isolate or whatever or dentures or something you know there's multiple ways that theater takes you soon [Music] punch it so right off the bat I would have thought these were gonna be gummy bears actually a fat piece boys so we're just gonna try one just because it's 25 milligrams you should always just eat one and wait obviously CBDs not ads that's crazy has THC you know if anything you'd probably just feel it only a little bit but you'll fill it here oh but right off the bat the taste phenomenal the aftertaste I do not feel any or I do not taste any like bitterness like I've done with I don't taste oh wait not there it is so the bitterness toward the end is minimal compared to the other brands that I've actually tried the gummy itself is very tender it's like and reminded me of like the fruit roll-up but like punched up into a square and more more tender you know not as chewy you don't have the to as much and it just easily you're just easily able to just bite through it this is what I reminded me of and it's not bad it's a 250 milligrams CBD total and there's 10 pieces so like I said it's going to be about 25 milligrams each so definitely you just watch what you're taking and just honestly not that bad you know I can only imagine what the THC ones will taste like - I'm not sure they're gonna be packaged the same way like this I'm really diggin packaging I really am it's very very nice I use a QR code here too and like I said this is their CBD lines so if you guys are interested you could actually buy it on their website the THC ones you're gonna have to go to the stores but see me Dean I'm saying and I know not a lot of people are probably in the CBD which is fine because you know it's not for everyone you know there are a lot of benefits when it comes to CBD and if you guys are looking to try something that's marijuana but not get like the psychoactive effects or like have it in your system let's just say you never get a drug test you know then uh try is to try some CBD you know just let me know how it feels I feel I feel like it just gives me a clearer mind and just it's like clearing out the fog in your brain for a little bit you know I'm saying it's like just things seem much more content I don't know how to explain it but that's how I feel other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed the CBD video I don't do too much CBD videos but when companies send me stuff and if I like the product you know I'll do a video on it so other than that peace out guys [Music] [Music]", "DkMbQ60tf9o": "hello all welcome to CBD headquarters today we're going to speak about CBD edibles what are the benefits what

welcome to this quick review of these hemp oil gummies for pain relief for pain stress relief anxiety relaxing and so on so this is the Dakota mix or X product I've bought this about 1 months ago and been taking two of these gummies everyday of course especially for pain and other things which I relate to fibromyalgia and if you want to know if it worked yeah I mean the quick answer is no so but I'm still going a little bit into my experience now in detail so I had bought two bottles I took two gummies every day one in the morning one late at night so before sleep and the NSA you should take I think to some people say they take four I think the recommendation official recommendation is one or two so I think I took definitely enough but there are a couple of things which are a problem with this listing or with this product actually it could be interesting before you buy I mean could be interesting to know for you before you buy something like that because there are a lot around I mean you can find so many of these things but what this is what I have found so far I mean the thing is there are a couple of things with really low value immediate sounds like a lot here it says 1500 milligrams 25 milligrams per gummy so how much is it really when you compare it to just hemp oil I mean you can buy hemp oil like a bottle like a little for maybe 20 dollars or so you have to know and when you buy one liter that means 1 1 million milligram so if you just buy oil you can get 1 million milligrams for $20 and here for $25 you get 2 times 1,500 milligrams so three thousand in total 3 thousand instead of 1 million so you get maybe an idea how much benefit you can expect I mean I'm not saying these gummy bears or bad I mean they taste really good 100% like original gummy bears and also they are sweetened with really good sweetener like an organic one I'm going to show that later on that's really good but really the hemp inside and yeah you also have to know I mean hemp that's not CBD I mean a lot of people here that like about benefits regarding pain and anxiety and all those things and usually these things are related to CBD and yeah it's not so much coming from normal hemp oil which doesn't have any kind of CBD so this is a different thing and also hemp oil I mean that's basically just a little bit of hemp oil in gummy bears and also hemp oil comes with some things which you maybe don't want to have like a lot of vitamin b12 which could cause a skin problems like acne and so on if you take too much you have to be careful about that but for me this or like just more or less very expensive coming bears and yeah what they say also they are talking about not Bund ins of nutrients and vitamins and omega 3 6 9 fatty amino acids and so on so when I was checking the box I mean the the back label yet the thing is actually here on the Amazon listing we don't find anything about the back label there's nothing about that usually you can expect that on an Amazon listing to see the bank label but here it is not so I'm going to show you that I've made a couple of pictures so you can see that if you're missing that and you see that there's not much I mean I can't see anything about vitamins and a lot of other good things most of the stuff is on zero and also protein and there's really nothing about white amines and though things which they are mentioning in the Amazon listing also these omega oils and so there's nothing and I've been asking the seller if they can provide me some information about that and that's also more than two weeks ago and they have delivered nothing so maybe that's even nothing inside so not only disappointing from the inside also disappointing regarding the service absolutely disappointing also the bottle yeah we have some more pictures I mean that's some part of it with recommendations and so on lettuce a yeah take one to two gummies and yeah here again the back label that's different that's the same which you can see on Amazon and that's the two bottles I mean they come perfectly sealed which is nice and then you open the lid and inside of the lid that was actually another late like a removable lead and that's usually supposed to seal properly on top of the bottle itself but it was not really sealed down it was not really properly glued down it was so somehow like half sticking on the bottle and half on the lid so that was also very disappointing so I just dumped it into trash and removed it because it didn't stick on the in the lead and didn't stick here so really useless so when you check for all the products I mean alternate products regarding hemp gummies I mean there are other listings which claim they have much higher values like here we have three 350,000 or even more here we can see in nine hundred thousand instead of one thousand five hundred I mean that would probably be a total different thing but I'm not saying it's a game-changer maybe it's just a little bit I mean it's not so much I mean I've been taking hemp oil like from the bottle the normal liquid hemp oil and it also didn't do a lot I mean really not a noticeable so I don't expect a lot and by the way I think some of these listings are even cheating I mean 900 milligrams would mean if I'm not wrong 900 grams but I mean 60 piece of hemp gummies they are not 900 grams I mean that's almost 2 pounds that's way too much so that's almost impossible I don't see that happening and you can see most of the other listings are way lower like usually around three hundred thousand five hundred thousand yeah if I give it another try would definitely stick with something around that maybe 400 thousand three hundred four hundred five hundred thousand and probably not one with nine hundred fifty thousand because I think that's not real and yeah I mean when you and you see at the reviews a lot of reviews are also not good I mean they have a lot of good reviews but I think a lot of them are fake I mean it's trying the product and so a lot of people are buying they know that and they pay for a lot of yeah paid reviews so you cannot believe all the things which are there in the five-star reviews they're probably way too much 5-star reviews so from my side I cannot really recommend them especially not this brand here definitely I would say stay away from the Dakota mix or X but also I mean I don't know if something like that really working probably just very expensive commie bears and if you want to have some real benefit from this weed plant you would have to go with CBD I think you need like prescription in most of the states in u.s. but just hemp I mean for me now after trying the pure oil and the gummy bears I it just didn't do anything and I mean the all the things here inside you I better go to the pictures from my side what's inside like the organic tapioca syrup which is the sweetened I mean that's a good thing I've been doing some research on that and most people say yeah that's one of the best sweetness if you want to use a sweetener you use this one yeah it's most healthy or least unhealthy so I think the recipe is good but I don't see any real benefit not I mean I don't see even though might amines not the Omega thing and you could buy white amines and Omega way cheaper so and commi bears as well so I don't see any need to buy something like that or definitely stay away so if you have other opinion on that other experience something like overnight miracle will be really really interesting to learn from you if you have anything I mean also any other questions or comments please write everything down into the feedback area most happy to talk about these things and if you liked the video give me a thumbs up subscribe my channel thanks for watching and see you next time [Music]", "oLdxYX22j44": "hey you guys I hope everybody's having a blast day if this is your first time tuning in my name is Nikki welcome to my channel if you're an over-thinker like me you stress out all the time easily irritated pain and your neck in your back I highly suggest that you watch this I know that all of my videos so far have been about fashion but I want to share this product with you because it works if you haven't already done so please subscribe to my channel and hit the notification ball so that you can be alerted as soon as my new videos drop just as a disclaimer I was not compensated for any of these items anything that I say today is my personal opinion it's my review and I would never talk about something that I didn't like I used to be a really heavy smoker about 6 years ago and one day I just quit cold turkey and I never wanted to go back to it because I didn't want to have that feeling of being high or falling asleep or eating everything until my stomach hurt or just being unproductive that wasn't me it didn't want to go back to that and so why not try this all-natural product the product that I'm gonna be reviewing today is the wild CBD gummies I know I'm talking about wheat I never thought the day would come that I would even be doing some things that weed in it or be talking about a product but here I am and I'm talking about it because it's good wild CBD company spelled wyl D is based in Portland Oregon I went to Portland a few months ago and initially I was getting these because my mom does take CBD I know Portland Oregon is like known for greenery and they have a lot of recreational weed clubs and you know since weed has become legal in a lot of states I'm like ok I'm sure they have some gummies wild came up as a top-rated brand I bought one for myself and I was like oh these are pretty effective the CBD ratio was 20 to 1 so it did have a little bit of THC these are the strawberry ones and these were the ones that had the lowest dose of THC they did have other gummies that were like 1 to 1 ratio and I didn't want that because I don't want any VHC I don't want to feel drowsy I don't want to feel sleepy and so I feel like CBD is you know my preference it's just what I need I know some people can function off you know smoking a blonde I can't do that like you know if I'm sober that's when I'm the most productive let's talk about the CBD gummies I want to go down the line they have lemon raspberry blackberry and huckleberry lots of berries all the flavors aren't really good I've tried all of them the strawberry one with THC does have an aftertaste but it's not as bad I feel like these gummies are the version of adult Flintstone vitamins and I say that because this is so good if I could describe the feeling of this if I'm super super stressed I take a low very very low micro dose of this and you know I'm smooth sailing so the first flavor that I want to share with you guys is the lemon a real fruit infused gummies so in each container there's twenty gummies it's 500 milligrams as a nonsmoker and because I've only started using this a few months ago I'm gonna tell you my dosage and you might laugh and I open up the lemon flavored and I want to show you guys what it looks like it's just a little rectangle shape with sugar coated on it they all have sugar coated on it and this one of these gummies is 25 milligrams of CBD I don't know for some people it just depends on your preference of how much you want a cake I really had to adjust to figure out what was the best dosage for me what I recommend may not be for somebody else you might need more you might need less well I don't think you need less because my recommended dosage is way less I'm gonna try the gummies one by one so I can explain to you the taste and the texture and what to expect for one gummy I do cut it in eight pieces yes 25 milligrams of CBD per gummy to a nonsmoker is a lot and I take a piece every couple hours I don't take it every day but I do take it in situations like right now I'm recording and you know times I get nervous and I can't talk when I turn the camera on I just freeze like a deer in headlights and I don't like that from Anna stressful situation I'm just not having like you know the best day or I'm just crying all day and I can't control it I can't you know I don't have any power over it because my brain is you know scrambling all these thoughts in my head all I have to do is take an eighth of this literally takes away all your stress I don't know the effects of if you were to take a bigger dose maybe it might last for longer but what works for me last up to three hours and really like that's all I need so I'm gonna taste the lemon I just cut a small piece because I'm gonna try all of them and I don't want to be over relaxed I'm gonna let you guys know what it tastes like so you know what to expect the lemon one has a bit of an aftertaste but it's not that bad the strawberry one with the THC is stronger have a real gummy texture like gummy bears but this one I would say it's like a gummy gel so it melts in your mouth I would still classify it as a gummy but it just doesn't have that chewy consistency let's move on to the next one raspberry I'm gonna be high as when I'm done doing this for you guys I like the raspberry one it's really sweet and it does not have an aftertaste which I like it's a little tart it's a little sour but it's also really sweet love it next we have the blackberry I really love these gummies that's why I bought so many I want to share with you guys a promo code and I really highly recommend if you want to try them to get on it now cuz I don't know how long the sale is gonna last and it's cool that you can stack the sale price with the coupon code I wish that it was on sale when I bought it cuz it wasn't this is the blackberry blackberry tastes exactly like grape jelly mmm yum I don't know which one I like now because I like sour tart things so I do like the raspberry but this just tastes like identical to grape jelly so yeah last flavor that I want to share with you guys is the huckleberry it tastes like a sweet blueberry and you know blueberries aren't sweet this has an aftertaste I think out of all four of them this has the strongest aftertaste there's nothing wrong with it but I mean if you're picky and your palate is like in its bitter than it's not for you I wanted to get the variety pack just to see which one I liked best it was also less expensive for one of these bottles by itself it's 3995 I never even knew a day would come that I would buy or pay for weed or like a weed product I've never paid for weed of course there are some people out there that are just anti weed when I quit smoking six years ago I was anti weed my cousin was the one who was like you should try you don't have anything to lose if you don't like the feeling then don't do it again I'm glad that I listened to him because it really helped me it helped me to bring down my stress levels tremendously I know that there are a lot of benefits for CBD it helps you fall asleep helps you with anxiety depression and it helps you be more social in settings where there are a lot of people it helps some people concentrate more it helps me concentrate more it helps with a lot of diseases cancer chronic pain it just regulates your mood and I feel like I wanted to share this with you guys because I think it could help somebody if this product could help me with my stress I think it can help you too that's it that's all that I have to share with you guys about the wild CBD gummies if you have any questions if there's anything that I missed please let me know in the comment section below I would be happy to answer any of your questions now before I go I do have some questions for you is there any other brand of gummies that you prefer what is the best method for feeling the CBD having you know quicker effects if you smoke it if you take CBD oil or if you take gummies let me know in the comment section below I was shocked by this product it was very very helpful to me I think you guys should really take the opportunity to buy this bundle of four it's 500 milligrams per bottle twenty gummies each you get one of each flavor the regular price is retailed at $139.99 it's on sale for a hundred and four plus I'm gonna give you the coupon code in the description below it's a wild 20 that's an additional 20% off and you get free shipping why would you not try it if you liked my video please give

and I'll see you soon you [Music]", "RkzMmHlE24c": "i know i've been high all week [Music] what is up my dudes this is our last trying video of 2020. it's not time 21 it's our last trying video of 2020. um welcome back to my channel we are trying flora cbd delta 8 gummies today i know i've been high all week pretty much doing these videos back to back um if you're new here welcome if you're not new here what is up you know we always have a good time here i try to make it a very safe environment for everyone to just have fun um so yeah like i said today we have a flora cbd and they're just delta eight gummies i'm really excited for these because there's different flavors sorry about the glare by the window so this is gonna be a quick video since i only have one thing to take so i don't know if you guys should see but there's 30 gummies 300 milligrams for the whole container and then they are 10 milligrams each so these are quite a bit less strong than all the other ones i've tried these are 10 milligrams for gummy so i'm quite excited to see how that'll affect me versus like the other 30 gram gummies i've tried before um i have some editing to do today so i'm hoping i can take this and be relaxed but not be like slumped like usual so floor cbd usually does cbd products i think this is their only or one of their only um delta eight products all right so for this bottle it is 34.99 but when i popped on the website i did see they were doing i believe 15 off for the new year and that is new year 15. so if you want to use that code i also have a link down below that you can get so many off with whichever you would prefer so there's not really much to say about this since it's not flower or anything so i'm just going to go ahead and open this and try it out and i'll take you along my day i'm not really doing anything interesting today um i have started not packing but organizing my clothes and some other things in my closet for our move which is not for two more months but it's a move we're pretty much uprooting our whole life for so i just took the little plastic thingy off they smell so good like i want to eat like 15 of these and like i said i'm glad there's different flavors so there's mango blueberry and watermelon this is what they look like they're like the sugared cube gummies i think it's so interesting that delta eight always comes in like cube gummies but i guess it's to differentiate from other other regular candies you don't want your kids to get into these and then there's also a qr code to get all the information if you are unable to just pop on the website so lately i've been going with the blue flavor always but i kind of want to go with the pink one if i can grab one that's where nails come in handy because you can pinch things like a crab so yeah it's just a little cube gummy as normal they smell so good i'm going to go ahead and chew it i hate hearing chewing noises so i might like pop some music in here oh my god what is that oh my god what is that okay that tasted great um i really want to try the other flavors but like i said i have things to do today and i want to be alert so i'm going to put these away for now so with those gummies there's no thc flavor like regular edibles you can't really taste it it just tastes like candy they're chewy and honestly that flavor tasted like um have you guys ever had those airhead straws it tasted like that it was deliciosa it's 225 there's not much to say or there's not much more to say right now i'm going to continue on my day pop back in tell you guys how i feel but i have a good feeling this is going to be a great like alternative to the stronger gummies if you just want that relaxation without being dead so i'm really excited for these um yeah i'll pop back in in a little bit and i'll see you guys later okay my dudes it is 3 25 so it's only an hour later a little over an hour later since i last talked to you guys and as you can see i am mostly completely normal i'm not talking slow i'm not slurring um i'm actually working so i'm editing my end of year video right now while i watch some netflix and we're still being productive which is 10 out of 10 beautiful because this end of the year grind i'd need to be present for it so yeah i only took one milligram or one 10 milligram gummy about an hour ago i'm still gonna wait to see if i want to take more um since i am still working the only negative right now is i have vamon jeans so i've eaten one of these already um this one's full so i'm probably gonna eat it soon i had some leftover like rice and beans i had two pieces of chocolate and that's it so i've been snacking i have my water here still drinking that so the only thing that i personally i'm like nah i have the munchies i have the munchies but it's okay we have no more snacks in the house i don't know what i'm gonna do because i'm not ordering food today i cannot order food again that cost me too much money so yes that's the one hour-ish update and i will update you guys again in a little bit but so far it's looking good okay so it is even later as you can see i've thrown the hair up and my video is currently exporting um i feel completely fine now i feel good i do still feel relaxed but my hunger has almost gone away so my current apartment has like a little store i just ran downstairs and got some hot cheetos while i was picking up a package so i'm still a little bit hungry but for flora cbd all in all it was pretty pretty good i'm like the best part is how low each gummy is so i can control better how much i'm taking and i was able to get work done i still relaxed i had a good time while watching netflix and everything but that's like my favorite part yeah the taste is great in everything i'm excited to try the other two flavors i'll probably maybe try one later i don't know but i want to edit this video and hopefully have it up for you guys tomorrow um this is the last video of 2020 because i think my next one's going up january 1st i don't know i kind of messed up with uploading days this week so i literally have like three or four videos this week because i just want to start fresh with new content for next year and nothing pre-filmed um so yeah if you want to try flora cbd um or the delta eight gummies um the link where they are will be down below and there's also a link in my link tree for i think it's 10 off i believe 10 or 20 i don't know yes so there is also a link in my link tree we can get a discount um with my link as well but either way i'll have the information down below um this would be so good for like this would be so good for somebody trying to ate for the first time or someone like me who just wants that lower dosage but i said that like 600 times anyway thank you guys so much for watching i hope you enjoyed this video if there's anything else you want to see me try throw it down below leave a comment a like and don't forget to

Denis Chapman and we all just came back from an amazing conference in Las Vegas Sandra is the leader of the oil barons team and we're going to give you guys a little presentation about some of the new things that happened at this event Sandra what would you like to say before we roll our first video just that convention was amazing we're not going to elaborate on convention though our main goal here tonight is to go over some of the products because we have so many products released that we really don't want to overwhelm you with a very long video so we're going to focus on three of the different products tonight and we are going to start with the new 1500 milligram and Denise is going to roll a little tape for you guys before we go into that [Music] [Laughter] [Music] so first and foremost I'm hoping that for those of you who are out there that are currently using our products you're going to notice that we have a whole new look to our bottle which is really exciting the old bottle is kind of had a little green swish that went across the front and you really couldn't at a glance tell if it was natural that was peppermint or if it was cinnamon so basically recreating the look of it is going to make it so much easier as we continue to add new flavors the other thing that we have on the bottom now is we have a QR code which is I think we're the one of the only ones in the industry that might even have that and why that is so exciting is you can take that bottle scan it with your phone and it takes you over immediately to the documentation and the third-party testing on that specific bottle so just again the other thing is that it's going to have the HAMP certification seal which we work really hard to get we are one of 15 companies out of 22,000 that have applied to the u.s. hemp Authority and so we have that certification seal which basically means that what we say is in our oil is exactly what's in our oil there's no BS there's no you know we're not trying to sell you something that we're not so what we say is in our oil is in our oil and again and it is the purest oil on the market so the new oil that we released is the 1500 milligram and so lots of people are saying well why did you guys create such a high milligram well the reason is that's what you guys wanted we've done several surveys and polls and that was one of the highest selected products that people wanted to see and they have priced it phenomenally so a bottle of the 1500 costs $149 so if you bought three bottles of the 500 would cost you what is that two hundred and ten seven yeah so you can see the saving so if you're taking the 500 you buy a four pack or whatever you might start buying the 15 because you're just going to take less drops and then that ball is going to last you longer so you know just amazing the way that they've priced pointed that so I think the label came out really great it's easy to decipher the flavors we know we've got the different color-coordinated strips on the side let me just see if there's anything I've missed and really it does it clears the way for you know for some new flavors that are going to be coming soon yeah so you know if I were to go into a dispensary here in Las Vegas and we've got them at every street corner and I were to buy a 1500 milligram of CBD oil I guarantee you if it cost me over $200 and that you don't know what you're getting so with us you know what you're getting Wow let's see then that we're going to go into I'm going to kind of share something the cat's kind of out of the bag so a lot of people that asked us well why didn't they give us a higher milligram on the THC free well the reason being is is that we're kind of going to be phasing out of the isolate and so what we're going to be doing is we're going to start eventually and I don't know when but we're going to start making the broad spectrum and so what that means basically is you're still getting THC free but now you're getting all these other cannabinoids that you weren't getting in the isolate so you'll still test negative on a drug test but again you're getting you know you're getting that effect of having all of those other cannabinoids in there so instead of you know focusing on the eye slits there what's going to happen is we're gonna have the different milligrams and flavors and everything eventually in the broad spectrum so to me that's super exciting because now those who are taking the isolate are gonna get I think a much better result with the product so it's not gonna have THC in it so that's it for the 1500 milligram so excited and I'm waiting for mine to come in the mail so yeah so the next thing we're going to talk about is the gummy bears and nice is going to show you guys a little video on that they come in three flavors orange so they are gluten-free but not only you'll see a lot of the market these are made we're not spraying on the CBD they're actually infused in the gummy so that gummy like I said is 10 milligrams each it's it's what a lot of you asked for so we came back so here it is so we're super excited about that another thing I explain to you is not only is it makes you free but what we call these are actually broad-spectrum so you'll still test negative on a drug test but the best there's more cannabinoids so that's what we love about this product and it tastes good like I said it's got three flavors or is 45 companies in each jar and it's a fantastic price so I'm excited about getting mine soon and yeah I think those are gonna be awesome but if I have those on my desk and probably eat the jar one sitting show probably not the best for me yeah and the best thing too is that for parents who have children that have a really hard time taking the oil these are great because lutely they're like handy to them so you know they can get an income maybe start with a half or whatever but still yeah awesome amazing they're all natural there's also artificial free artificial flavoring and sweet that was 69 was yeah and so the big deal that they are gluten free and so I guess most of them are made with gluten so hopefully that's going to be you know really important to people right so we're gonna go on to the new size of the renew and the relief and I've got a little video I'm going to run on that I know people love that because it's nice to have a big jar of that stuff so just let me cue that up here and we will carry on all right okay I'm super excited about this bigger size because I use the relief and the renewed daily and so everybody was like we need bigger jars and so that's what we got I'm so excited that we got the bigger jars of the relief and renew now the relief we have 50 millimeter jars and they have a hundred and thirty milligrams of total CBD and we're going to continue to carry the smaller jars of cream but the larger jars are going to give you more value because it's only an extra $20 so the original ones are thirty milliliter and there's sixty nine dollars and if you want to upgrade to the bigger jar it's fifty milliliter for $89 Wow I just realized that that's almost double for $20 yes it stays so and we still have the 60 day money back guarantee and so that which is huge and then the renew cream it's the you know the same thing applies for the relief and the renew we carry the smaller jars and the bigger jars have more milligrams of the CBD for only $20 more and the relief is our most popular tocqueville and it's infused with 80 milligrams of hand the dial CBD and it's also infused with the emu oil which is something I use before this came out which is it's just unbelievable when you put the combination of it together the the relief is a very potent formula and it gives you the comfort you need like say your back is a little strained or your feet are sore the relief is the perfect product for you you just gently massage a dime sized amount into your affected area and you just watch the tension melt away and it's for external use only and on the renew you're gonna just love your skin this I love it I use it every day and I can tell you my age but I'm up there and it's really helped my face but it's infused with 80 milligrams of CBD and it has the apple stem cells that's also known we call it the Fountain of Youth and the apple stem cells have been known to have tremendous benefits to the skin you just gently take a little dime size and rub it into your face I do it morning and night and I just do it every day I call it my daily choice and if you go you know on the my daily choice website it'll tell you that it may help you your skin look younger tighter and brighter I'm not gonna say made for me it definitely did and it could have increased longevity of your skin cells and it also comes with a 60-day money back guarantee so can't go wrong but it's I'm excited about that we have a lot more we have bigger jars now because I need bigger jars pardon me your skin looks amazing oh thank you yes I just turned 67 so I know it is the cream really I can show you pictures before and they didn't look and feel this good that's awesome I can't wait [Laughter] I'm just gonna enter one thing and on the on the new shipments that are going to start coming out they have increased the 80 milligrams of CBD to 130 correct yeah yeah so now instead of 80 milligrams so just two months ago we started with 50 milligrams and then they went up to 80 and now they've increased it to 130 they're not charging any more money for all that added CBD which I just think is mind-boggling so I can't wait to get a new jar yeah yeah it's amazing products good deal so I guess that's the end of this meeting we're going to be doing another one in a couple days on our new mantra essential oils so be sure to tune in for that and once again this is the oil barons team and the leader is Sandra laborat out of Las Vegas so if you want to join an amazing group of women then this is the team to join so thank you ladies and we'll see you again in a couple days all right sounds good thanks so much thank you", "5EYxcXyd0XM": "hi everyone its Anika with Anik overview CBD and today I'm going to be reviewing DVD gummies by Highline walnuts so first let's get started the ordering process I ordered online and it took about five to seven business days even during the holidays I was able to get it on time it came in this lovely box so I already unsealed it and then it was packaged it was well padded so if any if it wasn't handled mishandled you would be okay because it would be in bubble wrap so there you go it comes in bubble wrap also the shipping label is inside so it is sealed like this and then also it has supplement facts so one thing I look for when I'm purchasing CBD that it has dietary information also it should be have an SGA registered symbol I don't see that one on here but online it does say that they are oh sorry I'm so sorry it does say that it no it doesn't know it doesn't it just says statements have not been evaluated by the FDA product is a dietary supplement and isn't intended to diagnose treat cure or prevent diseases so it's supposed to have that statement also this one does not contain THC it is gluten-free non-gmo and hemp and GMP certified also another thing I look for is third-party testing which this one is third-party tested it has a lab tested sir to stamp right here typically nowadays I've seen a lot of new brands and new product having COAS so sorry QR codes which you just click on your camera and those will upload to your phone and that will direct you directly to their website or their certificate of analysis so the certificate of analysis shows the heavy metals if it contains any pesticides how much can it be Nadal it has in there and those are some things to look for so anyway and also a batch number and then a this one has a barcode which is similar to it's been regulated so for example if you buy a car you need a VIN number because if that cars being recalled you need to know to take it back the same thing for CBD and their gummies and their oils you need to have a batch number that makes it more that means it's regulated that means they have some background information on the product okay so there's a warning sign keep out of reach of children please consult a physician before taking any dietary supplements as always this product is not intended for pregnant or breastfeeding mothers they have their address so you can mail something to them if you want they don't have their phone number but all the contact information is online it's very easy to access so I've never seen these type of bottles before so I'm going to see how to open it it's the old it's just pinched at the side so ok throw it up in there nice blue gummies okay so directions are take one to two gummies as needed store in a cool dry place each DVD gummy contains 10mm of CVD okay I'm going to eat one but I'm going to put some music on because I know some people don't like it when others chew or hear them choose oh okay but these are actually very delicious I did not taste any type of sometimes I taste that ham flavor I'm not tasting any of that it has a very nice blueberry flavor these are their new product I have tried their old product of their gummies they were still really good they weren't sugar coated like these I don't have any of those last but they were very they were also very good and I did feel a very difference in my day with taking the gummies with this I can't tell you a effect right away because it takes about 30 minutes to an hour to digest so I have taken these before and it has given me a more relaxed sense of well-being but that that's my take on it so anyways guys if you have any questions about CBD or you would like me to review any others please don't hesitate to let me know but first you have to like and subscribe to my page okay guys I love you all bye Happy New Year's", "fMXgpwaB08U": "welcome back to the cbd scanner youtube channel i'm kostas and today we've got an exciting new product in store they are the cbd gummies from zen bears so inside the box you have packaging more packaging then you have the zen bears which is a lovely glass jar which contains 30 gummy bears each with 20 milligrams of cbd distillate you can see them in there don't they look delicious there's one other thing in this box that is this guy hello let's find out a little bit more about this product i'm so excited to learn more [Music] as with all cbd scanner product reviews we're going to be judging them by the following [Music] criteria first of all you get box of 30 and the bear the bear for me [Music] is a massive game changer i mean if all cbd players came about like this i'd be a very poor man because i'd spend all my money on them the product itself is packaged really really well i think it looks really premium the glass jar is a nice touch product information is really clearly laid out all around and when you pop open that jar there's a very exciting feeling of look at what's in there it's kind of like the buried treasure as for the taste well let's tuck in try an orange one at first you do get a slight taste of the cannabis extract the cbd distillate after you've gotten through that you are just eating um a regular gummy bear and it tastes like a regular cumin powder they're pretty sweet if i'm honest and you know i have a sweet tooth so for me that's really good but if you're someone that's quite sensitive to extremely sweet things then you know well i would recommend other product types than gummies [Music] now i mentioned just before that i thought that they were quite sweet and i think that is kind of reflected a little bit in the ingredients i don't find that overall disappointing however if you are someone who is trying to watch your sugar content this may not be the product for you my favorite thing about the ingredients of this product is that they are vegan there is no gelatin or animal products whatsoever inside these lovely delicious little gummy bears [Music] next up we've got potency how strong are they each gummy as mentioned before has 20 milligrams of cbd which has been pharmaceutically coated to the outside of the bear now i'll tell you why that's important in many cbd gummy bears they inject the cbd isolated distillate into the bear with the zen bears they've decided to pharmaceutically coat the outside now i've not come across many other brands that do this the reason why this is better is because of the way in which your body absorbs cbd generally when you consume cbd edibles the cbd is absorbed into your bloodstream through the digestive system and through you know through the stomach whereas if you take cbd drops or tinctures it's absorbed from holding it under your tongue for a minute or two and you have a lot of blood capillaries there which make the bioavailability higher so this is why it's really good that they've coated the outside of the bears with the cbd because what you can do is if you just suck the sweet for a little bit more of the cbd will get into your blood under your tongue rather than in the stomach [Music] as for testing it's really easy to look up the batch reports for each product on the zen bears website it wasn't obscure it wasn't hard to find it was very transparent and easily traceable so big thumbs up from us for that you can use this batch code to check when the product was created well it's also got the expiry date here i'm not sure if you can see i had a look at the lab report 20.14 milligrams of cbd 0.134 milligrams of cbg tiny bit of cbn same goes for thc well within the legal limit none disclosed actually so that's zero percent thc so what that means a bit of analysis on that is that you're basically getting just cbd there are very very very minuscule amounts of other cannabinoids there which should all complement each other and work synergistically to add to the what is known as the entourage effect which is all terpenes and cannabinoids working together to create a better effect [Music] we're ordering this product a 4.5 out of 5 because one of our favorite cbd gummies products that we've come across we think that the price point is spot on it's vegan we thought they tasted really good and that they were pretty potent i'm sure there are more potent ones out there but these these i think are you know they're the goldilocks of gummies as far as we're concerned [Music] if you'd like to purchase the product you can head over to cbdscanner.co.uk and you will find our product page which will list all of the retailers which offer this product alternatively you can follow the link in the description below and that will point you towards the zen bears official website where you can purchase the product yourself if you use the code cbd scanner all in capital letters which

CBD oils my favorite so far of 2020 if you're new to this channel what I do is I buy CD products for full price I send them to a lab to see if they're real well as of 2020 this year I send every product to two labs for blind testing why blind test products can you be so obtuse did you call me obtuse CBD products why can't we just trust blindly trust CBD companies and allow them to send whatever they went to a lab that they pay a lot of money to throw out any bad results and only post the good ones and then sell you crap I tested over 80 products over the course of a year without any sponsorship or affiliation but full disclosure this month for the first time I have added affiliate links to CBD examine calm to help pay for the products and lab tests product in lab tests are super super expensive and that's how we're gonna continue to pay for these lab tests well that's where I see things just a little differently contractor no I will not bow to any sponsor I did feel dirty adding the affiliate links to CBD examine calm though almost all review websites work with affiliate links or sponsorships of some sort but it felt dirty right it's like people only do things because they get paid and that's just really sad nothing will change on my website all new products will be purchased for retail price the CBD companies can't send me anything I need to buy them sent to two different labs for blind testing and the official reports of course will be available on each review the process all documented for your eyeballs and I will still be the same jerk that gives critical reviews but this following list was picked last week when I was still innocent pure and poor so after 80 product reviews here are eight of my favorite and these will probably change because I just sent fifty more products to a lab so hit that subscribe button to see more soon I'm gonna go over these super quick and you can just hit the link below to see all the full reviews the official lab tests or watch the YouTube videos on each one number eight oh Jesus look at that beautiful face okay this one needs an update someone lost their job back when Sun soil was called Green Mountain because they didn't know that full-spectrum products contain THC drug test look for THC when I did my review last year I thought that their their lab results could be a little more clear but they fix that issue since their lab results are now very clear I still think CBD companies should do a little more to warn people about THC and drug tests but that's a whole nother problem because if they put the appropriate warning on them certain government employees will flag them in mistake totally legal hemp for marijuana because the government the government in this tone is excellent and uses your tax dollars efficiently anyway back to us on soil here it's super cheap 30 bucks 600 milligrams of CBD our lab test found it was incredibly accurate on CBD trace levels of THC and lots of other cannabinoids the taste was not bad it's good for all the cannabinoids and the mint chocolate taste helps the natural flavor out a bit but it is a natural taste and it is a good full spectrum so that tastes a little like hemp EMP chocolate so if you don't like the taste of hemp move along just choose a different one if you want the cheapest full-spectrum USDA Organic CBD I think you found it five cents per milligram of CBD is incredibly cheap at only $30 numero seven cheap and trusted and that's not just a CBD company I tested Garden of life's 10 milligram in 20 milligram formulas that's two labs for lab tests dive in links below the $50 30 milligram formula that's 900 milligrams total came in at 5 cents flat cheap he's also taste excellent it's peppermint and orange zest it's really good both are labeled as broad-spectrum so it should have CBD other cannabinoids but no THC nope our labs found that they're basically just a CBD oil which is typical of broad spectrums nothing else most broad spectrum suck I like this as a pure CBD but really if you want other cannabinoids just go with a full spectrum instead of a broad spectrum this one has some essential oils added peppermint frankincense I guess you might be able to say entourage effect I give it to them because almost every broad-spectrum extract I've tasted is pure CBD and other cannabinoids are usually so low that they don't matter in these broad spectrums it's still a great deal for pure CBD and you're getting garden of life they've been around for 20 years and they're a great company I do like that their CBD is formulated by dr. Perlmutter you know grain brain I know it's probably BS he probably just tasted it and was like taste good and they were like okay good because we're gonna say you formulated it on the package and pay you a bunch of money you think that dude is in a lab formulating products probably on some yacht drinking herbal tea or something weird I would think brain maker that was a good book too okay on to number six most trusted brand bar liens our lab tests found this 1125 milligram bottle a full spectrum 70 bucks is a good full spectrum extract you've got CBD THC and good amounts of other cannabinoids like CBC and CBG by the way you guys I know uh people claim a certain CBD oil will be good for specific conditions we don't have enough research to suggest that these cannabinoids change everything I post the cannabinoid profile on every review you might like a lot of THC someone else may have negative effects from tea see you might find that cbc helps you someone else might just like pure CBD you really just got to try a few look at the cannabinoids when you find one you like they affect everyone differently under six cents per milligram great price I really like bar leans they've been around for thirty years and you really can't find anything bad about them well except I did find one thing bad the Center for Food Safety gave them a bad score for CBD testing which was complete [ __ ] that was my December 2019 update and my June 2020 update showed that the Center for Food Safety changed their score to an a stupid government I can say that now that I don't work for the government they were rating CBD companies on testing and transparency without testing anything I know I know and that's why you're here watching a completely insane person sense CBD to labs in California instead of putting your faith in the government yeah I was a government employee but don't don't hold that against me number five most loved CBD company this one is hard to argue with if I wasn't so cheap they would probably be my number one of everything they made the famous strange Charlotte's Web named after Charlotte Figi dr. Sanjay Gupta I don't think I said that right dr. Sanjay Gupta dr. Sanjay had a documentary that featured Charlotte and CBD and that really started the whole CBD movement you can trust dr. Sanjay because cannabis radar ranked him the number one CBD influencer of all time who's that clean-shaven baby face right there that's number two influencer in the world Charlotte's Web played a huge part and the legalization of hemp and I don't know if hemp would be legal today if it wasn't for this company probably not just don't say anything bad about them on the internet their followers really are passionate about them and will email you here's the here's the bad thing I said I really didn't like that the front of their bottle used to say hemp extract that's a [ __ ] term people confuse it with CBD it's not but I always gave him a little bit of slack because they were one of the first maybe the first to navigate the CBD world when you couldn't say CBD for legal reasons on the bottle they started this made CBD products before sea but he was legal then they helped make CBD illegal gangsters only halfway joking about the gangster part what they did was incredible and pretty pretty gangster now their labels are all updated and specific which I like because that's what I look for at CBD examine calm honest labeling our lab testing found that they make a good full spectrum extract even really need me to tell you that they're famous for that they have research on their company the only complaint I have is that they are on the expensive side their $30 bottle that's a new price is about 13 cents per milligram of CBD 15 cents is average but average to me is expensive I'm cheap you know that but if you're willing to buy their more potent formulas you can get a great deal they're 60 milligrams formula goes down to four point six cents per milligram of CBD if you're willing to shell out 275 bucks yeah so I would say go big or don't go at all but you really can't put a price on a specific strain grown by one company that's helped more people than any other CBD company and by more people I mean that they are the largest CBD company with by far the most reviews quantity a positive reviews number for re botanicals this is the first brand to receive a USDA Organic cert it's small but the founder was also the founder of Nu Teva the giant hemp super food brand that people seem to really like our lab tests found that re botanicals makes a well rounded full spectrum extract their new prices are between seven cents and nine cents per milligram of CBD average is 15 cents so good well great value for organic B first USDA Organic I use their role on peppermint CBD oil a lot this one smells so damn good I'm cheap but that smell gets me every time I like it put it on your temples relax a little bit number three best pure CBD med Tara matera is one of the first CBD companies to win a mainstream retail contract you can find them in CVS yeah there's a yeah there's a theme here I like well-respected companies that have pushed the CBD movement forward mainstream in this case by the way they reduce the price of thirty five bucks it seems like all CBD companies are getting cheaper right now I need to update those prices I bought before because they're dropping especially in the last few months in light of a certain shutdown of the economy not sure how that makes CBD cheaper but it has met Tara is nice for people that don't want th see our lab tests found that this is just clean CBD oil nothing else not even CBD V just CBD and they don't make any THC products so this is good for anyone who can't have THC in their system and doesn't want the chance of the product that the product might get mixed up with a THC product or somebody might look at them differently for having a CBD product with THC this doesn't have it this is the one that I recommend to my firefighter friends that can't have THC or shouldn't if I was still a government employee this is what I would pick up and if you have a soul-sucking job where you also get tested for THC met Tara's great I have a full video on CBD and drug testing there's a caveat a bad test is still in use today but for the most part pure CB means that you'll have no problem with drug test that tests for THC their new price brings this down to six cents per milligram of CBD excellent I've tested some that are over thirty cents six cents is great pure CBD has no taste so this has no flavor no weird hemp flavor I like med Terra but if you do want THC look out for Lazarus number two cheapest CBD on earth Lazarus Naturals now in the Bible I didn't read it but I do have Wikipedia Lazarus died and Jesus brought him back to life so when I was deathly ill from a hangover I thought maybe using Lazarus I could come back to life I'm not gonna make medical claims or suggestions for hangovers but miraculously I did come back to life this also happens to be one of the most potent extracts that we've tested for THC so it could have been that by the way always look at the THC levels of the CBD you're getting two milligrams is a lot you will feel that and I cannot confirm that it will bring you back from the dead like it did for me but you may feel it a bit there full-spectrum CBD is so damn cheap I can't believe it when I tested it it was at four cents per milligram of CBD for their $32 bottle and they just updated their prices this month and it's now three cents they're stronger formula is at two cents per milligram it's so cheap it was already the cheapest now it's it's that they beat their own record it's the cheapest cheapest cheapest but please let me know if you found anything cheaper than this because I'd like to test that one out to our testing found that they were extremely accurate and it was one of the most potent full spectrums that we've tested with a lot of CBC and CPG as well now the only downside is that the flavor is also potent it's super earthy but just looking at the candle levels I would expect that they use a natural ethanol extraction process some people don't like that because it does keep the natural flavors ethanol alcohol goes away completely during the evaporation stage but you're also left with one of the most potent extracts possible of kin monoids so if you don't like the natural flavor of hemp this won't be for you but it is such a good deal they make pure sativa tea products as well and I'm testing a bunch of their new products so stay tuned for that number one best CBD company Bluebird botanicals I've been a fan of Bluebird for a long time I wrote about them in my book hemp for migraine best book ever by the way and I'm a very modest person and I wrote about them on CBD examined for a long time where I test products for transparency and accuracy this company pioneered transparency today most companies provide lab tests online a lot of companies provide inaccurate lab reports but that's beside the point Bluebird was one of the first to may be the first to show real lab tests for everything I've tested for of their products now a couple of multiple times I've got more tests on the way also and their lab results have been excellent my only complaint is that they don't make any flavored products no gummies and instead of lowering prices in this time desperation the prices actually went up by a couple dollars still cheap still great still the best company but I might need to rethink this number one spot because everyone else is lowering their prices and I'm super cheap Lazarus load their prices last week Bluebird I'd like to tell everyone you did to in an update next week it's not like my opinion matters it's not like people pay attention to the top video review on Google right now out of 3810 Bluebird review results there are full-spectrum extracts are well rounded and potent I've always compared them to Charlotte's Web but cheaper still cheaper so I can't really complain about the price that prices have always been great and everything about the CBD company is positive too many good things to list and I really like that they give massive discounts to disabled low-income and vets Lazarus does that too if I didn't mention that before bluebirds founder is also the vice-president of the u.s. hemp roundtable which led the political fight for hemp legalization this is just a solid company that has built a reputation over years pioneered CBD transparency and pushed for legalization they really are in a league of their own so there you have it my favorite CBD companies and this list is bound to change because I've already sent 50 more products to the lab subscribe so you don't miss out and I will see you next time", "uBlyb3dh02U": "good afternoon we're going to make some THC infused gummies first step is to make sure you have everything that you need out so our items are a three ounce package of unflavored jello or flavored gelatin not sugar-free I'm using two packets of unflavored as per the recipe that I posted and 2/3 cup cold water I've also got my lecithin to the side to put a little bit in because that is a nice fat protein that the THC bonds to there's a little machine that keeps it to a perfect time without having to go back and forth to the stove also has a link posted since we're doing super Lemon Haze on blue so let's again box tile I like to make sure it's very loosely powdery because it'll stick together I said it is a plant fat protein mini whisk mix all of these powders together enter water so we want to make sure that all of the gelatin is wet and separated and there are no clumps of gelatin that are still powdered the gelatin is mixed and 15 minutes has elapsed the gelatin has soaked up the water so enter the trusty little heater you turn that on I'm going to go ahead and break up the gelatin a little bit here and I'm going to wait probably about 10 minutes to come back and stir it again back quick search it's starting to look clearer for the record I'm doing blue for super-lon haze because true clear has a blue label just like I did read for indica and I did yellow for hybrid alright we're gonna let it sit another five minutes so it's been a little bit I'm gonna go with that is as clear as it needs to work because there's lecithin and it doesn't get that crystal clear like if you're doing candy but it is quite smooth quite runny I'm going to inject the super Lemon Haze truth here into it that has been so deep and warming in a cup of warm worth yeah it's tough [Music] and what i'm doing here is optional ma'am I usually pull that off but I'm going to pull some of the jello up in give it a shake and squirt that back in we all want to make the most of all of our product so I'm going to stir that in and once again I'm going to let it sit for five minutes to infuse before we put it into the molds all right we're gonna give it one more stir then because this is gelatin and not egg I'm not gonna whisk it super fast assuming it's going to stay in there [Music] smells like THC so the gummy bear molds that I put the link to hold about a milliliter you don't need to measure but they came with little droppers I'm going to hand this off to my partner because he has a much better non-payment you if you drip anything cuz it's silicone it's gonna that's basically gonna be one dose all of the little dots that end up on top of the silicone yeah kind of scrap all those at the end put them together it's almost like having an extra Bayer we use the opposite color or a different color than the jello you he's gonna go ahead and fill the rest of those up and we'll be back in a moment on to another bold [Music] we're gonna go ahead and stipple some cornstarch onto the back I put these in the freezer they've set and I've let them come back to temperature to make sure there's not a lot of moisture so this is my makeup brush there's a link to this this is the stipple the flat top that's what we're gonna stipple with so I've got cornstarch I just used the cornstarch lid they've got a little folded up foil and a paper towel in case I feel like it's getting too thick so I just went to stipple along the back of these and if you feel there's a bit much you can always go back and kind of wipe something away the nice thing about the brushes you can twist it and if you feel there's too much corn starch somewhere then you can use the edges of it so I like to know that my backs are good prior to pop them out I'm gonna pop this one out like so now gonna turn it over and show you the quick way I just stick my nail into it and pop them out and then lay them out afterwards welcome back to the final step we're going to say it's been 24 hours these will stay out overnight these have been out for 24 hours they're slightly smaller because they've now reduced down a little bit in size once they have dehydrated a bit as such I stipple them on the top with the cornstarch and I'm able to have them not to be sticky any further questions please feel free to send me a private message or post on the video however you'd like thanks", "vbDIdQ0IvIE": "what if you guys I'm back and I'm reviewing the Charlotte Webb CBD it's 60 milligrams per 1/2 dropper and there are 200 servings per container so okay one thing I did hate about this it's hard to get open I can't imagine what an old person would be going for trying to do this like my grandma would she'll be irritated this is the color it's like a golden brown the taste was pretty plant II did taste like marijuana if you're into that you're not into the marijuana plant taste do not get this one because it does taste strongly like plants so my experience with that I have anxiety I usually take CBD for anxiety I took I took two droppers at first to see her to half droppers at first to see like where I was at when I had anxiety and it didn't go away after the two droppers I waited at least 30 minutes to see I ended up taking two more droppers and it still it went away a little bit more but it didn't fully deplete the anxiety kind of took the edge off and I've had CBDs do that before that's kind of how this one was for me I did have another experience with it and it was very strange so I took the CBD before my yoga nidra class and I don't know if it was the CBD or my anxiety or the yoga class but I felt it up stoned afterwards like like I didn't want to drive it was so weird maybe I was dehydrated but I really I I don't know it was so [ __ ] weird you guys yeah it was kind of like I was like I took a huge edible or something it is full spectrum but I don't think I took that much to get this stoned off of it so maybe I was just like oh my I don't know but that happened other than that yeah I used it for anxiety and it never really fully depleted my anxiety it kind of just kinda just took the edge off a little bit and made me mellow out a tiny bit but not fully but yeah I mean it the CBD works especially if you guys are just getting into CBD Charlotte's Web isn't bad to take they're based out of Boulder Colorado check them out you guys this one is the mint chocolate and the flavor wasn't too bad was too shabby they also have a citrus one I think um if you're in the market for another word yeah just check out their website yeah stay tuned", "1KFsDtQ689Y": "sunny skies CBD gummies our THC free they're made with CBD isolate and they are strawberry lemonade flavor they are available in 12 packs and 50 count jars they are handmade here in our lab in Durant Wisconsin we are a licensed food grade lab in that we have a food processing plant license at 10 milligrams per gummy the 12-pack is a total of 120 milligrams of CBD and the 50 count jar is a total of 500 milligrams of CBD they are made with real cane sugar and honey not with high fructose corn syrup it is important to note that edibles have a longer on sort of action time than tinctures so give it about a half hour before you expect to start experiencing relief as with every sunny skies CBD product our gummies have a QR code on the label that when scanned pull up the lab results from that batch of product [Music] you", "uhqe6XRPRDM": "hi guys welcome to a produce TV within a video today in partnership with CBD star are we making CBD brownies so to make the CBD brownies we're gonna be using a little something called a TVB so this is already saved but says can be in the form of normal weed or you've got your CBD which is this guy here and we've got you can be here so we're gonna add this at the end of the recipe to get the best effects so first of all you give a grind up your CBD and then you're gonna use it in a herbal vaporizer such as tax-free fine things are the best because you can fit a lot of CBD in there and once that's all thanked essentially just empty your bowl until you get a good amount like that and then so when a lot of people use their CBD in their urban vaporizers they tend to throw away what's left but you can still use this so good think about it you can actually eat it as it is so after you faint it you can eat this if you want it's not going to taste the best so we get an experiment and mix in some brownies so you will need 185 grams of unsalted butter 185 grams of dark chocolate or milk chocolate or any fancy dark chocolate it tastes better yes better of the two 85 grams of plain flour 40 grams of cocoa powder three large eggs and 275 grams of caster sugar and as much anything bitter times will allow you to take so first off we're going to mount our and chocolate and go from there so 185 grams of chocolate and 185 grams of butter yep okay so we're going to put the chocolate in the microwave have for about a minute but keep thinking out about every 10 seconds just to check how it's doing it might take a bit longer than that depending on the microwave just keep on a low setting yeah don't want to burn the truck there okay so once you've melted the chocolate we are weighing out the butter and hundred eggs five grams of butter as well and that goes into another Bowl to know so now we've got the melted butter and then onto chocolate we're going to preheat the oven to 180 degrees 160 from a fan oven so now we're going to mix the chocolate and melted butter together and then ena for a number of a mini or two and then leave that to cool until it's at room temperature one of the things we might receive anything oh we could do cupcakes cookies waffles pancakes you could even make your own chocolate bar essentially anything that involves butter so you can do full course meal and do some lamb shanks some mashed potato well see very much potato nice so now we're gonna line the bowl so it's just so the browning doesn't stick to the bottom anyway so now you're square or rectangle a little bit this we can use to actually butter up there [Music] [Music] [Music] so now we're going to do the dry ingredients so you got your flour and cocoa powder your so and you're sure that I often beaten the roads how long does that take specifically to work well it depends on the potency so it all comes down to how much you're gonna put on top but usually the time is in rhythm so half an hour up to two hours so I feel after half an hour to us so it's the same as when you're fading the CBD or when you've got under the drug towns so it will know you out you've been it's relaxed nice got light so if we need 85 grams of flour so now we're just gonna stick this into the bowl get rid of any lumps that are in here so who's even going to help law benefits other so why do you seek deem a leave sort of back pain and a lot of people use it for going to sleep at night so more or less for people veterans or crank pain always having trouble to sleep at night it's gonna help with that now we do need the cocoa powder about 50 grams if you're a poor dane use this evening sorry most of the dry ingredients done now that's what you say as well okay so now we've just broken up some chocolate we're just gonna add some in there for a bit of different texture because it's delicious but obviously you can add anything you want to it's completely optional what you added at this point yeah let's just check those in there yep so next we break in free eggs I'm not as I can't break eggs yeah we need 275 grams of caster sugar that is to go in with the eggs cool yeah it'll weigh down so it's going to make 5 grams of sugar yeah all right now we're going to mix all the egg and sugar together with a whisk for about six to eight minutes yes and you want to whisk it until it's quite pale color joke just show this yes prepay or something yeah that should be good to go cool so what's next so now we're gonna mix in the melted butter and chocolate into the Moosey mixture so we're gonna fold it in to try and keep as much air in there as we can [Music] you don't want to stir it's gonna get rid of the air right joke yeah that's why you're gonna fold it in this way that's it so obviously today we're going to eat TBD but yeah there's lies on the ways you can have CVD what are all the other ways so you've got the flat form which is in that jar there yeah and then you've also got oils so you've got the under the tongue drops you've got the both liquids and you've also got might faint sprays you've got CBD drinks there's out there now possibilities of illness yeah so you always see you see really quite a lot would you say eating's one of the best ways or what would you say is probably the best way of taking CVD I would say that the fake liquids are the best ways to take care cure Lee because as soon as you found that about a minute later is into your system and it's already working you know instead of in Internet yeah and then seconds probably the CBD flour so it's sound principle it gets into your system a lot quicker and then third I would go under the tongue drops and take about half an hour to kick in and with the edibles such as the brownies this can take a piss or two backwards so some people might want a baby or smoke or put it under their tongue Satan's probably a better solution because most people at brownies yeah a lot of people like brownies in some people but you can make any food with singing gays so it doesn't essentially have to be practice yeah so now we're going to add in the chocolate lumps and then we're gonna sit in the rest of this mixture into they're almost done so now the tracks are in there all we have to do is sit in this mix and [Music] so we've finished folding it all in and it's looking pretty much like brownie mixture very Brown nice and gooey yes none of the flowery dustiness to left or anything at all yeah so now we're gonna pour it in and start the cooking process [Music] [Music] so some flat or even as even as we can get anyway now it's just time to cook so you want the thickness of the brownie to be pretty even or over just so you don't have some parts of really cooked in some parts that are all yeah one ends really thick in the others roof in you're gonna have a burnt side and then slightly raw sighs that's not not amazing no it's a we even it's looking good what we have to do now is pop it in the oven for about 25 minutes cuz should be done so it's 25 minutes in the oven yeah if you want to put it in the middle of the oven dry heat so we've set the timer for 25 minutes obviously it's not 25 on there now so we've said it a few seconds ago but once that's done we're gonna double check to see if it's good say if it's wobbling when we move the Train then it has to go in for a little bit longer okay so the Bradley is all done all we have to do now is let cool down and melt the last bit of chocolate for a little layer on top and then we're just gonna sprinkle the avb on top of that is now for the finishing touches we're gonna add the ADB into the melted chocolate pour it on top even out and be done once they're cold why is it worth putting in the chocolate and neither are mixes so you can do it either way but where this has or have been heated up in the PACs device it's already gone through the process of decarboxylate so you're gonna get the effects I mean you can it straight away it just skips having to cook it in butter for about three hours okay so if you didn't want to vape it first yet to get the ABV you would just cook in butter first yeah so what you usually do is in like a slow cooker mix it with some butter leave it for about three hours 10 and staring at about every half an hour okay it's just quicker way to do it so you don't have to bake it first you can just cook in the best yeah [Applause] [Music] so similarly as we did one for the actual brownie mix in there 10 we're now just spreading evenly over the seemingly melted chocolate so we've spreaded on the melted chocolate mix with the avb so we can give it about an hour to cool and then it could to eat oh thank you very much for watching Olivia vape induced e-m-f CVD star share this on to your friends who want to make CBD brownies happy baking [Music] [Music]", "kXmXt-7ar98": "How we doing YouTube, my name is Dennis Morales and this is let's chat CBD Reviews and education I'll probably start posting educational content, too. But for now We'll be reviewing different types of products. And today we have CBDfx's mixed berry gummy bears boom For those of you that like gummy bears gas-station gummy bears are the best Walmart, gummy bears are the best don't at me Catch me on Twitter @Dennismorales13. If you really want to @ about my gummy bears, but if you don't Then stay away These gummy bears are where it's at I genuinely think that a broad spectrum Gluten-free non-GMO and overall vegan product is a totally solid way to go for anybody that is interested in getting the CBD in a more healthy holistic way Being that it's broad-spectrum broad-spectrum has a 0% THC. Can you see my about zero percent which means look I can take My daily serving of CBD chill myself out, catch a vibe at work because I'm probably stressed right? And when my boss comes in hey Dennis, you need a... You need a drug test. I'll be like, yeah, no problem I'm good because I take broad-spectrum CBD products that have 0% THC there are pros and cons to it overall But for anybody that does get drug tested regularly, I would recommend a product like this that is broad-spectrum 0% THC. I'm gonna say it as many times as possible So you guys get the point but my overall experience with again the mixed berry CBDfx gummies Was pretty solid I have been taking CBD for about two years now And I've been in and out of different products as you can tell I ate at all. So it was really good It wasn't overly sweet when I saw mixed berry. I got kind of nervous because I I don't really have like a big sweet tooth But with this product I genuinely enjoyed it. It wasn't too sweet. It wasn't in your face sweet like gas station gummy bears, although I love... I love gas station gummy bears I need to stop buying those But This product was a solid product and I would recommend it for anybody that has any interest in getting into CBD that doesn't want to smoke or consume tinctures Like I get it both sides of it. Smoking lately has been kind of a turn-off for people and tinctures, not everybody's cool with putting oil in their mouth I Totally understand that that being said these guys go at on their website for About $49.99 I believe. Yeah, $49.99. I'll double-check and add a caption in the video and It's pretty dope if you guys are interested in buying this product, there's gonna be a link below I am an affiliate of CBDfx.

free they're vegan and they're 100", "4g9AfFnPqKU": "[Music] [Music] welcome inside Fitness informant calm for this important YouTube channel armed fi founder and CEO want to thank you for stopping by to check out this explainer video of green roads CBD infused relax bears that's right see buddy making a ton of noise within not just sports nutrition but the world so today we're going to talk to you about a nice little convenient product these are the on the go packets of relaxed bears from green roads but they also provide it in a bottle form as well for those of you who want to store it at home so today we want to dive into this and discuss it to you a little bit more so CBD in general what does CVD well though these are cannabinoids okay cannabinoids receive II D is a is a spectrum of various cannabinoids that are they say are over a hundred of them but right now the industry is really focused on anywhere from five to seven so you typically see C be laid out in three different variations CBD I slit which is Iceland CBD and isolate cannabinoid there is CBD broad spectrum which is a broad spectrum of cannabinoids that does not contain THC the THC is removed and then there's what they call full spectrum CBD which can contain up to 0.3 percent THC green Rhodes uses broad spectrum which means this is th free CBD CBD per research studies have been shown to reduce stress and anxiety can help alleviate pain and discomfort these are the big the big benefits of CVD that people are looking for the big difference here between relax bears the gummies and their oil is essentially the application how you use it the CBD gummies you eat just like a gummy bear the oil is an application that you put underneath your tongue for about thirty seconds now I'll tell you that they both work great but the relaxed Bears taste better because CBD oil straight doesn't have the best taste to it so what is going on here with these CBD gummies these relaxed bears from green woods well these are pretty simple and the I'm the gold package you get five gummies you get ten milligrams of CVD per gummy for a total of fifteen milligrams of CD which is a sufficient dosage especially for people trying CBD for the first time now a big thing with gummies as it can compared to say the oil is it's gummies it's going to have sugar aka carbohydrates so what we recommend here that find how we've been using the CBD gummies is we actually use it pre-workout typically with a higher stimulant pre-workout powder why well stimulants albeit can call biet are good for energy production too much can provide anxiety and too much stimulus can provide this crazy anxiety so taking the relaxed bears from green Rhodes pre-workout helps alleviate that anxiety while still getting the full benefit of the stimulants in terms of energy wise of that pre-workout another cool thing about relaxed bears pre-workout is it does contain those carbohydrates so you are getting 15 grams of carbs per packet that 15 grams of carbs it's simple simple carbohydrates which means it's going to go into your body quickly it's gonna it's going to increase your blood glucose levels which is gonna cause your body to release insulin the reason why it's good pre-workout is you get that glycogen up for energy and you have bigger fuller pumps while reducing anxiety now that's not to say you can't have relax bears at any time of the day you can but the biggest benefit that we see the relaxed bears for us and those in the fitness community is really pre-workout post-workout as well would be nice to help alleviate discomfort any sort of pain from the workout restore glycogen stores quickly but you can have a slight crash from simplified carbohydrates or simple carbohydrates like if you have that Vegas skills for instance you might have a slight crash so this for us is a versatile product we like the on-the-go packets because they're quick convenient you can take them honestly on the go but they do have the bottle variation as well the CBD is a full spectrum CD which means there's no THC you're getting good cannabinoids it does seem to work in terms of alleviating stress and anxiety it's a unique flavorful way to get your CVD daily these are delicious they literally tastes just like candy you don't taste the CBD in at all and green roads is a company that is pioneering the CBD movement partaking in legislation helping out with regulation and enforcement and with quality controls each of their packet contains a QR code as you see here you as a consumer can scan that QR code it takes you 2/3 tested results so not done by green roads who have done by a third party to insure you that you actually are getting real CVD in your product in an industry that's blowing up so quickly there's many copycat brands out there providing absolutely no CVD but making a ton of money off it that's not green roads each and every single one of green roads products including their oils their gummies even their topicals all have that QR code that you can scan with your iPhone or your Android device and verify that you're actually getting a CBD prac relax bears from green roads pretty cool product pretty neat very simple in terms of its just sugar and CBD essentially so pre-workout is where we love it the most but it definitely helps you get that CBD in daily fifty milligrams if you take five of these a day in terms of the on-the-go packets or you can obviously pick and choose how many you want to take given how you decide to buy the product you guys want to purchase this product

business lots of opportunity out there i love these elderberry gummies they contain 15 milligrams of premium cbd alongside of 50 milligrams of elderberry extract per gummy and elderberry extract is a really interesting component because it provides immunity support through its richness and vitamins and antioxidants it's huge trend right now retail vince i know you can definitely speak to that it's not slowing down and these gummies they're dairy free fat free and gluten free and personally that delicious grape flavor has me sold nice that's okay she's gonna hire me but let's let's talk about it in the retail escape um and i've got this is where you can tune into our youtube channel get some video extras see how these all look so i've got the eight count bag uh right in front of me um 120 milligrams of cbd per bag that breaks down to 15 milligrams per gummy i did the math for you so you don't have to do it and then obviously all of the nutrition facts and ingredients and our qr codes on the back they also come in uh 50 count uh bottles and that's the 100 count bottle so the varieties there but let's talk about this um correct me if i'm wrong but in the retail landscape this is what they'll primarily see but they may also see the bottles at some point depends on the type of store but elderberry to genus point is a very um trendy product ingredient and it's really taken off so uh right away when we launched these i mean we were already getting quite a few orders for for each count um pretty excited about the packaging too um people probably could see in there the it's a matte black foil look which is a little bit different than we've been doing so i'm pretty pumped about that and they taste amazing so um again it's something that in the stores people see elderberry they're attracted to given everything that happened last year and just from the community health wellness so to have this new skew is pretty exciting so now you both have ahead i'll be honest i have not had the gummies yet um you both have had the gummies yes correct so what would the flavor profile be for those who may not be familiar with elderberry uh what kind of know it is elderberry but it is kind of a grapey flavor um but they taste great like really really good so um that's all i'll say about it awesome maybe that can be the 2021 best new product when it comes uh when it comes time for some awards what do you think it tastes like i would say it's like a deep berry i like it a really deep berry um it's delicious and i love the packaging this might honestly well i don't know i say that about every product but boy that looks cool yeah this is some of my favorite packaging we've done yeah and something else to chew on no pun intended hemp bombs will soon be introducing a new flavor of gummies the botanical blends those will be available in a 50 count and 100 count tell us a little bit about these gummies that'll be coming out um a few weeks now from when this episode is published i love that i'm going to become gummy gina from this point forward but it's a classic proprietary blend it's got some natural relaxation ingredients which i really like that so if you're not a big fan of melatonin but you still want that same sort of relaxing effect i think you're going to love these and these are back by popular demand folks so customers told us they loved our classic formulation so we brought it back for you i believe those are also 15 milligrams of cbd correct yeah 50 and then they come in a 50 and 100 count model and uh stay tuned to our social networks and our website for the reveals and more information on those and then at the end of the episode we'll tell you how you can even sign up and have the opportunity to try some of the new products even before you can buy them or maybe win them stay tuned for that shifting away from gummies but continuing with edibles and i'm going to just kind of do some uh remodeling here on the if you're watching on the youtube channel and you see me moving all around because i can never keep my hands still i'm just going to remodel a little bit here and the cbd capsules um you know and love there's more of them per package and there's also a new variety but let's first talk about the quantities and then we'll let folks know in the new variety so we we adjusted the capsules to match the gummies so a 8 count 20 count 50 count and then 100 count so same 15 mgs on the original and then the higher potency obviously has 30 mgs of cbd per capsule so you'll notice this is the eight count so what used to be a bag is now kind of a nice very nice packaging box um so that's the eight count and this is the high potency version which has 30 milligrams of cbd per capsule that's uh 240 milligrams for apec right for those uh keeping track at home and then something and i'm excited about this i'm not i'm not a big sugar guy especially right before bed i do take two cbd gummies sleep gummies before i go to bed however now the capsules come in a sleep variety and this is the first time we've had a sleep variety of capsules right yeah that's correct and um do you may touch on the ingredients a little bit more but i do believe they're vegan as well correct yeah i do believe that as well yeah the capsules which is i i think that'll be a an added value for people but mainly to your point people that don't want sugar before they go to bed um i'm excited to see those and and we've already got good feedback about having a capsule melatonin cbd product which is somewhat unique i would say and uh something to point out because we did have capsules new and improved relaunch a year ago yeah nothing has changed with these capsules outside of packaging quantity and then the the sleep variety sure so joe the purpose behind this was to kind of bring home that more is better campaign that we've been working towards so you know we're leveraging our the cost savings we recognize as a fully vertically integrated company we're taking all of that savings that we recognize as a business and passing it down to the consumer through more value so as been said it was used to be a five you're gonna get eight now if it was fifteen twenty if it was sixty you're getting a hundred so i'm really excited to um you know be able to bring that to our customers and i really love the fact that these little blister packs that are in our um our eight count how great is this for travel it's perfect i can slip it right into my you know suitcase or my purse and i'm on the go so this is a great quality product and i'm pretty excited about our forthcoming launch yeah and then our final product that we'll discuss we don't have the um packaging here just yet to display but they are also coming soon uh probably within a month of this episode and it's an old favorite reimagine new flavor and that's our cbd max chill shot a new flavor more cbd and tell us a little bit more about the max chill well it did go away for a little bit and um i think it's one of those that was also brought back by demand so we reformulated and we're super excited about some raspberry flavor i believe correct yeah raspberry dream is it good though have you tried it yes it is awesome you know so would like cbd 100 milligrams per bottle uh great price point and you know i think it's uh it should do very well so but yeah it was away for a little while and then brought it back due to the demand for a quality shot product and we should mention um there's a way to get your hands on our products even before we did this with the elderberry gummies where folks can sign up provide their email address and i want you to talk a little bit about maybe some of the promotions that may be coming up especially for the capsules as we get uh ready for that i love that yeah so um go to our capsules page right now just go to hemp bombs look for current capsules right now if you give us your email address as soon as we launch these products we're going to be giving away a free a count capsule with purchase so if that's of interest to you you want to try capsules maybe you've never even tried that you're a big edibles fan and you like the gummies this is a great way to at least get exposure to that product and sign up be one of the first folks to try these great new products that we're selling and we're finding ourselves doing more and more of that another great opportunity is social media if you're not already on our social media accounts shame on you just kidding not shame on you but it's a perfect

i'll generally just eat all these wait an hour come back to you it's gonna be the same thing all right now i was gonna roll up a joint for right now but um i think for the first hour i want to see just how i feel off these before i smoke just regular just so i can give you a clear answer and then go smoke i guess that's like the responsible thing to do i don't know i don't [ __ ] we might have to come back early and smoke all right all the edibles are [ __ ] done the mystery was garbage green apple garbage but i hate green apple if you guys like green apple let me know man that's crazy because i do not drink some water all right man we are going to come back in an hour see how we feel um i'm a little nervous to be honest because i've never eaten this many edibles on delta a um but i do feel like my tolerance is high enough it's only 200 milligrams like the whole pack is only 200 milligrams so that's why i don't really think it's that big a video to be honest so yeah all right we will be back in an hour boys all right one hour later all right boys it's been about an hour and a half now maybe a little over off of the whole bag of edibles and um you know man i will say i do feel a little high i will definitely say that i feel pretty focused man if anything like i had heard some people say that and i was like okay but i feel pretty focused man and honestly uh i just wanna smoke me a bowl right now and uh just share with you guys so i'm feeling pretty good about an hour and a half got some [ __ ] done around the house did all that [ __ ] sorry cheers so yeah man if you guys have ever eaten uh delta edibles let me know in the comments um i've just been big chilling right now too my cat's over here chilling my dog downstairs is chilling uh yeah it's been pretty fun

regular delta nine so that also mixed with it so um overall it wasn't bad experience at all honestly it wasn't hard kind of chill um i got a lot of [ __ ] done was pretty focused i thought i'd maybe be able to i just like sit down and watch movies all day sorry i just sit down and watch movies all day no did all my [ __ ] still kind of high gonna eat some food and now i'm gonna go watch some

with another dope ass video and in today's video though it is nothing like what you thought it was going to be it's interesting it's new not really it's okay anyway today we're going to be talking about the hard truths and negative side effects of delta a yes that is right so as you guys know i have made two videos over delta eight i made an edible video which if you haven't seen go check it out it's awesome and then i made a video just talking about delta 8 the carts those are my two most popular now i don't want to be known as the delta 8 guy but i've tried to get that bag though there hasn't been a whole lot of research done on it and now i've done more research on it myself i've had time to you know use it whatever um and i want to talk about the hard truths now we're going to spark an actual joint of weed of marijuana so cheers boys so the first thing on my list delta a is similar to delta 9 which delta 9 is thc that we smoke the cannabis and the only dif real difference is that literally the chain effect of the cannabis or the chain number 9 or something like that t-god can pull it up delta 8 tetrahydrocannabinol has a lower psychotropic potency than its close cousin delta 9 thc it is known to connect to both our cb1 and cb2 receptors well so they're very similar delta 8 is being discovered as an alternative to 9 since it produces a less intense gentle enjoyable and manageable high when compared well in the aspects of healing and stuff like that but for delta eight even though you can federally buy it it doesn't get you as high as regular weed does you still fail a drug test so like that's pointless wouldn't you rather just smoke delta nine now i know for some people failing a drug test is a really big deal you know what i mean man i had to change my hair i was over here looking like a 13 year old emo kid you can't accept me at my worst you don't deserve me on my back you're still okay with failing a drug test but buying delta eight online why are you choosing that over delta nine you know i would much rather smoke regular weed than fail a drug test over that all right the second thing now if you watch my delta edible video you'll know that at the end of the video i was smoking a joint outside we're gonna i also did a 1500 milligram edible challenge delta 9 thc and i was not nearly as high as i was off of just 75 milligrams of delton delta 8. i mean i was uncomfortable i was tired i didn't want to do anything i got nothing done that day i just was like done i was like all i want to do is sit here and melt on the couch don't ever fit into the quote or the stereotype that you don't do anything but you need to do more when you're smoking that way people know first it was fine i was relaxed but then after like two hours i was like oh man i was like this is terrible all i want to do is like go to sleep i gave these edibles to a couple co-workers they all said that they were just like super relaxed off one but then i gave them two and they were like oh man it's too much my girlfriend could only one she ate one went to work and was like [ __ ] up she said it was terrible she would never do it again if you want to be lazy and like you want to do nothing all day and you just want to sleep uh i definitely recommend it it would be helpful if like at night on to the next one so the next one is the dab pins you can buy all this stuff online okay this is federally legal so just so you know like i'll put the link again in the description i wish they'd come and [ __ ] uh sponsor me man so i noticed though because i i had used two two dab cards i smoked two of them but first of all the price is ridiculous i mean it's like 35 40 and you gotta wait for it and that kind of sucks that [ __ ] was harsh look look look at me moss that [ __ ] was harsh okay like it really like i wouldn't even blow it out my nose and it would hurt my nose which is crazy and like it would make me always cough and it was like a anybody that i let hit it anybody anybody bro they would [ __ ] cough their ass off like people that smoke like what the [ __ ] it's like a really big rush of like this big body high like just right away and it was weird and then sometimes i wouldn't get high at all like one minute i'd be really high the next i wouldn't it's supposed to have really a non-psychoactive effect that's what makes it different from delta nine um i don't know i don't know if that's really true though to be real honestly that brings me on to the next thing is that it has a pretty bad stigma people for some reason thought think it's like that synthetic weed that spice that [ __ ] back when we were like young i can't believe anybody smoked that [ __ ] i did i will be honest i'll if you guys want to do a story time about that it is hemp it is from him it is hun no there's it is not that [ __ ] but it has a bad stigma i mean it's definitely not that spicy [ __ ] though for sure so that brings me to my last point okay so they're already trying to ban it like they're i don't know when they're voting i think they're voting in like november or december somebody told me in the comments it's like to me it's not you know to me it's not fake weed but i think it's still a little sketchy you know it still has a lot of positive benefits as well though and so i'm thinking if you had seven likes on this video if we get seven likes okay you guys have been [ __ ] killing it bro look look you guys been killing it all right i appreciate all y'all for real we're getting more subscribers i'm trying to hit 50 by let's see what is it september i'm trying to hit 50 at least by the end of october hopefully yeah let's try to do that all right let's get 50 subs bro seven likes we will do a positive review because there are positive things about it i know that i've said that the negatives of it but that's from my personal experience from me trying man let's finish this [ __ ] joint holy [ __ ] [Music] so now i've looked and i found a lot of positive things so hit that seven uh hit that seven light goal boy and we will do another review yeah man that's all i got to say about it this joint is pissing me off much love y'all seven likes do it do it all right go to twitch.tv link will be in the description uh go to my twitter man i'm trying to get my twitter up as well like i want y'all to be able to follow me and

"yo it's me dead carpet and it's 449 p.m. that's Wednesday I'm May 13th 2020 oh yeah Benny wagon um a few days ago I got a package in the mail from koi CBD they sent me some stuff you know basically for free but you know this isn't a sponsored review or anything you know these are all my opinions no just saying but anyway I haven't had this kind before of the CBD gummy so does one do a video of them you know I'm betting why I forgot to mention in my last video of the normal like koi CBD gums the tropical fruit ones you know the six-pack like with the one that comes with six guns of my local smoke shop is $11 but the bag I had yesterday had 20 guns so gnarly for sure how much the price would be probably a little bit expensive but you want to mean you know from the amount of gummies though you get and because they work good to you you know I think it's worth it you know just saying anyway I haven't had this flavor before but they also have this and a six pack on my local smoke shop I didn't get this one before but you know you know since they sent me them for free though you know I'm just gonna try them anyway you know just saying anyway today I'm gonna be reviewing the sour

the planet Saamy experience the koi standard WWE Naturals calm so Facebook Instagram Twitter and YouTube logos so you know canon comes with the red green and orange from gumminess basically I'm gonna take half a bite of each gum and it has you know the sour powder on them the normal ones didn't have that sour powder so see you know anyway I might have forgot a napkin or something these are a little bit greasy and sticky anyway first one I'm gonna try is the red one and they say coy on them you know but yeah anyway well these ones are like really soft we're competitive the normal ones they're not really as chewy or gummy you know I was just gonna eat half of them each of them when he ate that one full but I'm just gonna half of this one why [Music] well the cherry one was sweet was a little sour though but tasted most of the same as the original cherry one lime one yeah I definitely liked their original wine one better than one sour line one has basically the same lime flavor but um you know lime is not really like one of my favorite flavors you know anyway no one made it a little bit more sour a little bit like nasty or tasting so you know wasn't really as good as the original my mum here's the orange one I didn't get to review the orange one on camera of the original kind but it's my favorite kind of these gummies so this one's probably really lit you know just saying also they don't really smell you know maybe a teeny bit but um can't really probably smell anything off these gummies see what I mean anyway here goes [Music] sweet but also sour basically has the same orange flavor so normal gummy just a little bit sour you know it's also a little bit worse than the normal the only one these gummies that I like to um was the cherry one actually I like it about the same as the normal cherry one but the cherry normal one's a little bit better though I like I'm about the same though but I think up or heard the cherry one best of these sour gummies so you know what I mean but you know they're so pretty what you know and they'll help you get unlit I guess you know they may help with pain relief and anxiety relief and stuff so you know I already had a few of these normal kind of guns they definitely helped me and get a little bit of pain relief they help you sleep better at night you know and also yeah they definitely help to like relieve some anxiety and sub 2 and pain relief yeah I think they're pretty lit um they definitely work better in those one extreme um CBD come inside oh god the gas station like about a month and a half ago and then make a video on them though but I put a picture on my Instagram stories on these will definitely way better than those and those were like way more expensive you know for only like five gummies it was like almost $25 you know that was like a bad idea for me to get those in wasting my money I guess yeah but these though these though definitely work better though but I'm I still think my favorite CB product is the hem bomb CBD pills those ones work like the best for me anyway so you know these those really help calm me down you know help me feel good you know just saying yeah these are still pretty good though you know like the normal ones a little bit more and means these are still pretty good though so I probably get the sour tropical quite the CBD gummies um I'd probably give these like an 8 out of 10 you know just saying they're so pretty good but um I like the normal ones better in the sour ones you know still pretty good though so you should definitely try them you know just saying yeah I don't know the price of these but on my local smoke shop a six-pack is like um 11 dollars you know so this would probably be more not you know I'm just saying yeah I definitely try them nothing fun they're actually still pretty good so yeah I got an 8 out of 10 I'll try to do some more CBD videos soon steer more videos for watching see you guys later peace out and bye", "aaOsASispno": "[Music] okay guys welcome back the supplement review now this week we have something a little bit different these are CBD Yanni's called calm before the storm in the chaos crew you may remember them there's a brand that brought us bringing the chaos pre-workout and we've also been testing their new my stint as well so I'm really excited to try these because bring the chaos with one of my favorite pre-workout stew last year now these are CBD gummies that CBD oil is a non psychoactive version cannabis oil so you shouldn't get them high in order to go too much into CBD I'm gonna leave that the guys from Kaos crew this video benefits of CBD dummies and I'm gonna be doing for the next 20 nights they recommended me to take one before bed you've got 25 milligrams of CBD oil in each one of these twenty gummies in the packet variety different flavors I wanted to open the video hey guys Stephen here from Kaos crew on cheap chefs nutrition and today at Eric is doing a review on or Kaos crew sweetie guys we've had them out for a while and I as you can see they look like sweets but they're definitely enough to keep you keep them away from kids anybody bought them so each one of them is infused with 25 25 milligrams of CBD which is quite high and just to put that in perspective here's another brand of CBD where we do it's a 500 milligram 30 30 milliliter and so each full drop gives you 16 milligrams of CBD and for a good oil and you care and the faith holders milligram range that you know that's what you'll be getting about 16 milligrams they can pay 10 milligram are you know 10 ml a liter bottles out of Holland board but you're not going to get very much CBD so 25 ml and won't call me is a lot going on the rest a minute you know somebody you know I basically I use things in a tank for sleeping to begin with I think it started with off would call me and it was Fame at the minute a use about one so just to begin with half ago me brownie but are you just the tried out if somebody's gonna be a bit bigger manifold full coming and we sell them most like a recovery a recovery go me for after trainin and to bring you down and after the chaos of the pre-work right and what chow anybody can use these and I can make medical claims on this or gets classified as in Madison so you know I can't say this can help with anxiety what else yeah snapping you need to be living under a rock enough to know the facets of CBD there's a lot of CBD on the market there's a lot of crop pollen Bart you can't wait to pay off or even with the likes of this this is fine for you general sort of stuff but my facts is if somebody is in a lot of p.m. and things like that and you're gonna want to go for a really a strength it something like a 1500 milligram 3,000 milligrams weight or something like that but for general use sleeping and sort of Lake sort of stuff recovery after tree mmm bring you down off the chaos this is the stuff and so hopefully you enjoy the review guys thanks so it's night one we're gonna open them up and have our first CBD gummy see it they taste like so much you open them up you get two packs of ten they're in their bags so let's open this up and try one so there we are each individual CBD gummy they're quite sticky let's give it the old taste test hmm taste why is very nice very sweet it's light off the taste but that's 25 milligrams somebody tells me this is gonna be a really good night sleep 1999 three trying out our gummies and yeah so far feel like I've slept a little bit deeper I haven't woken up as many times during the night yeah starting to really enjoy it a couple bills tonight so they're sticky and the chewy then he's gonna help me sleep okay so we're down to the last six I'm doing this I thought I think they're helpful to unwind in the day they seem to be helping me sleep a little bit deeper especially when you've been taking a hardcore pre-workout at like six seven o'clock in the evening and these help me calm down a little bit and for bed so the flavors are really good too so I think I'm gonna have green today today is the last day of the CBD Jionni's looking back on it they've kind of helped me to relax in the evening it doesn't make you sleepy it just kind of makes you calm it's always difficult when reviewing a recovery product to tell whether or not they're working what's attributable to the recovery product and moisture is natural recovery but overall I have enjoyed taking them a be interesting to see over the next few nights so I've stopped taking CVD how I sleep whether there's any noticeable difference when you finish in the course of Domi's here we go it's the last one okay so we've come to the end of our test of the CBD gummies from Kaos crew now in my research online there are a couple of things I came across that I thought it was worth touching on the first one is the issue of bioavailability of CBD when it's consumed orally now there are contrasting opinions on the effectiveness of edible CBD over CBD that you put underneath your tongue for example or CBD that you vape you take in through the lungs the main issue with edible CBD and CBD colonies is how much of that CBD is actually gonna make it into your system you're gonna lose a certain amount and the digestion process and then you're also going to metabolize a certain amount of that my benefits of vaping CBD and consuming CBD underneath your tongue but it absorbs straight to the blood vessels are that you will get a higher percentage of that CBD absorbed into your system however they come with their own drawbacks some people don't particularly enjoy vaping and I've heard from other people that they don't like the aftertaste that putting CBD under your tongue can give you again it's a matter of choice now how effective these gummies are for you is gonna depend on two things it's gonna depend on the amount of CBD that your system metabolizes and your sensitivity to CBD as you heard the guys at kau screw themselves say if you're looking for a high dose CBD then probably another product is for you if you're somebody who's using relax and to recover from sport than these may well be suitable personally my experience in using these was that it was enough I felt as you heard me say in the review that I was sleeping a little bit sounder that I was generally quite relaxed after I've taken it that's very difficult to say how much of that was [ __ ] bow and how much of that was genuine but given that I went into this with very sort of low expectation and I did feel a noticeable result that dropped off when I stopped taking it I feel like actually yeah for me these did yield the results now there $34.99 420 yummies so that works out to be about 1 pound 75 and 9 you can get that from the shapeshifter website I'm gonna put a link down below I'll also put some links to some different articles about the bioavailability of CBD when it's consumed orally so you guys can read and make your own mind up ok so in conclusion I enjoy taking these I felt that they did help me relax I thought they did help me sleep a little bit better as well especially when combined with natural ganda in fairness I haven't used the top side of the tongue so my experience with CBD is somewhat limited if you're in the market for CBD you like the sound of gummies you can check them out the shapeshifter website I put a link below thanks for checking out this review guys and I'll see you in the next video [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] panic spots place [Music]", "DAkcuoKkllQ": "eighth time for another hemp gummy review next i'm earl batman stringer i'm crystal lewis aka the bit mom yeah we're brother and sister but we're also something else we're both about that fit life welcome to btfl it's your man earl batman stringer and in this video we talking about hemp gummies a game all right i just tried another uh brand of hemp gummies now about maybe a couple months ago i tried the uh the eclipse brand of their hemp gummies and it was pretty good you know i mean i talked about my experiences with it so i took a little time off then i decided to try another brand of the hemp gummies and these are from a new age all right you can check out the bottle right here boom boom boom all right so the cool thing about the new age is they actually give you two bottles right just in case you look at this you're like dog this is full you ain't try these i'm almost done with the first bottle so when you get these you actually get them you like together they give you two bottles um i think i paid around 30 bucks maybe a little over 30 bucks i'm not sure obviously i will link these below if you want to check these out i got them from amazon so link will be below you can check them out for yourself if you want to um but anyway these are the new age hemp gummies now a lot of people take gummies hemp gummies for multiple reasons but usually when you talk about hemp or the whole cbd thing usually people take them for two reasons one is for pain right and for two they usually use it for calming or helping them with sleep like those are the things that i notice people taking for the most me personally i kind of was getting into the him thing just more for the sleep thing right i don't sleep enough which is the issue i need to work on i'm trying to work on so i've been taking these uh you know about an hour or two before i go to sleep and um that's why you know always looking at him products and you know things like that um and i gotta say with these i like these i do like these i feel like they do help me sleep um they actually do help me like feel a little more relaxed even compared to the eclipse uh hemp gummies i talked about how i felt like they they made me sleep a little a little deeper i felt these i feel like when i take two of these and you probably could take even three if you want to i feel like you know they don't make you be like after you take some right but i feel like when i take them say i go to bed at like 2 30 in the morning i usually take these around 1 12 30 or 1. and i notice like you know just kind of like i'm chilling on the computer doing some stuff i'm like all right yeah i'm i'm ready to go to bed like not like i'm just you know like it hit me but i just feel like it's like a smooth progression i notice with these and i and i sleep really really good now keep in mind maybe it's because i sleep really good because i go to bed late and i get it pretty early i don't know but i i will say i notice a little more uh calmness sleepy effect more with these than i did with the eclipse uh hemp gummies right that's my experience with these now one real quick you're the dog in the background scratching themselves that's my guy that's my guy anyway these are what these look like alrighty about this big um one thing i will say compared to the um compared to the eclipse brand these do have more of an aftertaste effect than the eclipse i'm keeping it real like these do get you like it's not terrible but some people might not like the aftertaste of these especially if you take two of these um you may notice like like that little aftertaste depends on how you feel about that but you definitely get it out eating these like straight up the taste the taste is good you know with these but you do get this little aftertaste that's like but they're still good you know it tastes definitely it's cool but the aftertaste all right so that's my take on these him gummies guys i feel like if you're trying to use them for maybe relaxation or helping with your sleep i definitely say check these bad boys out um you can comment below if you taking another kind of brand comment below i like to check it out you know what i'm saying you know get my opinion on it all right that's my tape you want to check them out link below be sure to subscribe and i will see you in the next video peace thanks for

description let's go [Music] you", "y914vMiSaWw": "hi guys welcome to another episode of ask dr. Patel where I answer your questions about medical marijuana and CBD oil now today I'm going to answer the question what is the best ratio of CBD and THC for you by the way totally forgot my white coat today feeling completely naked without it I feel almost undocked early but the show must go on so let's get an answer today to your question what is the best ratio of CBD and THC for you now first of all what in the heck is a ratio so basically in the simplest of terms what we're talking about is the amount of one chemical relative to another so let me walk you through a couple examples so say for example you have a product that has ten times the amount of CBD compared to THC basically that is a ten to one ratio of CBD to THC now to simplify it further I want you to think of it as being in a room and having 10 CBD balloons and only one THC balloon so there's a greater likelihood of you bumping into a CBD balloon compared to a THC balloon so it's same when it comes to the human body you can think of it as CBD having more of an effect than THC now let's think about the complete opposite scenario okay so let's say you have 10 times the amount of THC compared to CBD so basically that's a 10 to 1 ratio of THC to CBD so again you're in a room and there are 10 th see balloons compared to only one CBD balloon so there's a greater likelihood of you bumping into a THC balloon than a CBD balloon so same thing with the human body you can think of it as THC having more of an effect than the CBD okay so hopefully that helped to give you a visualization of ratios now what sort of CBD and THC ratios are on the market okay so you have products that have high amounts of CBD and those products can come from either hemp or marijuana then you have products that have high amounts of THC and these products come from marijuana and then you have products that have equal amounts of CBD and THC and again these products also come from marijuana and you have every other imaginable ratio in between now bear in mind that just because you're using THC doesn't mean that you'll get high off of it basically you only get high off of THC if you use too much if you use the right dose of THC then you're not gonna get high off of it and of course a doctor like myself can help you figure out how to take the THC so that you don't get high off of it and a doctor can also help you figure out which ratios of CBD and THC are gonna be right for you now having said that I am going to give you some general information on what might the patients that I've treated have experienced so which conditions benefit from high amounts of CBD mainly for migraines and headaches for muscle pain for nerve pain for anxiety and for mild to moderate insomnia okay so for instance with the muscle pain the CBD is highly beneficial for back spasms for nerve pain the CBD is very beneficial for back pain caused from sciatica for neuropathy whether it's diabetic neuropathy or neuropathy caused by chemotherapy or even trigeminal neuralgia now when it comes to anxiety the CBD is beneficial for anxieties such as obsessive-compulsive disorder post-traumatic stress disorder attention deficit disorder attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and panic disorder okay just to name a few there are conditions in which to effectively get results you do need some amount of THC so which conditions need some amount of THC we're talking about conditions like nausea and vomiting lack of appetite autoimmune conditions such as psoriasis rheumatoid arthritis Crohn's disease severe nerve pain is so for instance nerve pain caused by shingles and back pain caused by spinal stenosis and then finally we're talking about severe insomnia so this is when someone just can't sleep without the help of a medication whether it's an over-the-counter medication or a prescription medication I hope you found this information helpful and if you did give the video a thumbs up below make sure you subscribe so you don't miss out

"3ndzIh0FltI": "[Music] hey guys welcome back so today I'm here to talk about two products and one of them I already talked about in a previous video but the products that I'm gonna talk about today are slightly different but they are still CBD related products well I have them here two variants to suit your needs one of them is the CBD oil lemon flavored this time and the other one is a premium CBD gummies now that's interesting it's two different ways of taking CBD if the previous one that I talked about did not agree with your taste buds I mean of course I understand that some people might not like the fact that the oil doesn't have any taste which is why you have the CBD oil that is lemon flavored it's basically the same same application same dosage and you take it one to two times per day depending on your needs now the one that I want to focus on today is actually these premium CBD gummies gummies that's actually super interesting because it's it's something that you do in any sort of situation without raising any suspicions or attention basically it's maybe just about attention so with these clever little gummies what I do is that I have them at work on my desk ready for me to take them okay so the the dosage of this is the same as with the oil you can take one gummy one to two times per day so you don't want to exceed that side-effects from excessive dosage I believe it's just gonna be like extreme relaxation and tiredness and laziness you do not want that to happen when you're at work so I'm gonna go ahead and take one because I didn't take my oil this morning so you have them in different colors as you can see you have purple yellow orange and these are actually different flavors I'm gonna go for the purple one see what that one tastes like so here's a purple teddy bear it's a teddy bear and a few cats here and they actually taste good that's a good thing so what I'd like to do is I'd like to take the oil at night and in the morning before heading off to work since the dosage is twice per day I like to keep these at work and to have them in case I forgot to take the oil in the morning that's a very very clever technique because as I said you can have the gummies you can be sitting at your table at work and all of a sudden if you put a gum into your mouth it's gonna seem perfectly normal no one's gonna wonder what you're doing whereas if you're putting the oil under your tongue it might seem a little bit different so both of these brands like the previous oil that I talked about our premium Jane and let's go through the website so this is a website of premium change which manufactures these products as you can see you have all these different products here you have oils capsules topical and gummies so so far I've talked about oils and gummies that the ones that I can talk about so oils as I said I've already done the one of the oil without a taste that would be this one and now I did one about this one so now you have also different taste that I see that this one is a new one mint chocolate faith flavor that sounds very interesting now as I said you have different strengths of this products these on top are the strongest ones they have a thousand milligrams of CBD tincture per dose if you go down you will find the ones that are slightly gentler these are the ones that I have 300 milligrams per dose for me that's been good enough to treat my symptoms maybe you want to go up to 600 milligrams or maybe all the way up to a thousand milligrams if you want to explore and play around with different products you can try as I said the gummies these come only in one strength 750 milligrams so it's a good like in between sort of those as I said from getting only just one gummy I find extreme relief a very exciting product that they have is this bath bombs if you're lucky enough to have a bathtub at home you can get these bath bombs and that's gonna provide an even if possible and even more relaxed bath experience and then you also have the topicals or creams if you've been to the gym and heard a muscle if you just have general muscle pain back pain I can tell you that applying the CBD products to whatever painful area is going to provide an incredible amount of relief or you can also put it straight into the body through a capsule so you don't have to chew gummies you don't have to swallow oils you can just swallow it in and forget about it so about premium Jane this is a company that is based in Scottsdale Arizona it's a family company they grow the plants there in their farm with the help of chemists and biologists they extract the purest CBD from these plants in this way I know that it's a reliable product because I know that the doses are controlled and that you're not just gonna get CBD without knowing how much CBD you're actually getting you're gonna know what kind of CBD you're getting and to what dosage that I think is a huge plus I've been offered various kinds of CBD and these products may be cheap variations that you find off the street and nowhere to be found the amount of CBD that is contained within these oils or creams or whatever so for this reason I really trust premium Jane and I really think that it's a great initiative and a great thing and a great thing to have happen to the CBD market and in this case to MS patients so here to sum it up why buy premium Jane because well as I said and I want to stress the quality of materials it's lab verified and this being a company that is actually active and actually exists and that there's you know palpable people behind it there is a real customer care you don't usually get that when you buy it off the streets so that's why I find this product extremely trustworthy now let's go back to my video so effects that I can mention about these products is that not only are they're super easy to take I like the fact that they come from a reliable source there are so many CBD products out there and either they have a strange grassy taste that's slightly unpleasant especially if you don't like weed if you don't like smoking weed because of the taste this can be a great alternative to that not only that but it's only CBD and what do I say that that it's only CBD well in my case I was never a fan of smoking weed or you know well smoking a joint to treat my symptoms because for some reason it doesn't suit me well like the THC has a very strong effect on me and it makes me really have these psychotropic experiences that I do not enjoy they made me super anxious they made me paranoid and just ended up with me never using them despite them actually being very very helpful so the CBD has all the effects that a joint would have - the psychological effects it merely has just an effect of calming you down ever so slowly in a way that you don't even notice like right now I just took that CBD and I'm not really noticing anything my eyes are not turning red I'm not starting to freak out and I'm just actually I'm just really really calm right now also it's incredible how much it helps with the spasms I used to really struggle when I woke up during the night to go pee having to walk to the bathroom that is my most terrifying moment because my legs shake out of control and I often cannot make it to the bathroom without stumbling against a wall or something now with this my walking is a lot steadier and not only my walking but I'm a yoga teacher I'm a yogi so when I teach the class and I demonstrate a pose my legs don't shake as much so it's not as embarrassing so it's providing an incredible amount of benefits in my case and I'm sure there in your case a wall as well so an added bonus to this if you're interesting in purchasing these products through seeing this video if you use the code a life have sub written below you'll get a 20% discount over these products so I encourage you to go ahead try the different variations of the products that they have and see which one suits you best I can tell you the gummies taste amazing they're super practical the oil either doesn't taste of anything or replace elf a pleasant lemony taste great products I hope you go check them out definitely keep me posted and if you have questions about these products go ahead and write your comment I will answer these questions I'm usually quite responsive to my YouTube videos so go ahead ask me any questions you like and I will provide you with information thank you for seeing this video guys and I will see you soon take care enjoy your gummies enjoy your oils bye bye you",

have the extra added benefit of having some CBD you know alright these things are pretty good I've gotten I just because I got this right here doesn't mean I didn't get extras in it doesn't mean I haven't been eating these things are the bomb let me tell you but before we get into that let's go ahead and check out the packaging and then we'll go to the fun stuff alright guys so here you got it just a nice bag it almost looks like it's recycled um it's like a waxy paper bag kind of nice uh in here you'll see CBD FX hemp gummy bears you got an 8 count this is just like the little fun size snack pack it does contain full spectrum CBD it is gluten free it is non-gmo and it is vegan oh yeah that's right so for all you've eaten out there you can eat these yes you can let's flip it over and on the back the supplement facts serving size 2 gummy bears servings per container you four so obviously you got to eat to to match what's on the label no fat 16 calories sugar 2 grams not bad not bad at all did we cover carbs nope I don't think we did carbs 3.6 grams whew so there's really no carbs here 20 milligrams a hip extract and 10 milligrams of CBD per gummy bear remember you got to take two ingredients organic cane sugar organic tapioca syrup water organic seaweed extract natural flavors and colors organically grown CBD rich hemp oil gummy bears contain no corn syrup no animal gelatin no artificial sweeteners so that makes them what guilt-free indulging never tasted better that's right and it's true these things are delicious on 19min a lot these statements have not been evaluated by the FDA or not intended to diagnose treat cure any disease they have to say that because the FDA you know doesn't really regulate any of this hasn't really looked into it yadda yadda but trust me trust me Kenna pity all in CBD is naturally occurring in the industrial hemp plant and legally imported and produced that's important I do have a fact sheet over here that I'm going to go over with you to tell you why these are legal these are legal you are allowed to have these product and design our trademark cba dfx does not sell or distribute any products that are a violation of the u.s. control substance act the u.s csa made in the USA alright so now that we covered the packaging let's get into what's actually in these things I do have a fact sheet so allow me to read you some of the facts all right CBD FX premium CBD oil has been meticulously sourced from natural organic hemp plants grown in Europe that's very important that they have been grown in Europe we'll get into that in a minute and then shipped directly to their lab in Southern California the cannabinoid oil offered through CBD FX is always substandard sustainably sourced from the highest quality plants which ensures that you reap the benefits of all the cannabinoids terpenes and amino acids fatty acids and vitamins & merrill's it's got all of that stuff in here guys we're proud to offer our customers the most traceable organic CBD oil for sale anywhere cool so they can trace ok so you get this bag in particular they can trace this back back to the plant that it came from which is nice so why is it legal alright it is non psychoactive hemp and it was deemed legal by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2004 the hemp biomass okay which means the big crop of where the CBD comes from the hemp that is sourced from comes with an import certificate signed off on by Homeland Security and they only use CBD derived from the stalks of European grown hemp plants their products meet the standards of 2014 farm bills definition of compliant hemp must be industrial hemp and contain less than 0.3 percent THC hmm products are exempt from the CSA and the DEA s drug scheduling practices which classify whole hemp extracts as schedule 1 drugs extracts and here's the important part extracts from the stalks of EU grown hemp are explicitly exempt from this scheduling practice so there you have it now we will put the facts to the side tear this open and try one right guys so here we go that's terrible to try I'm telling you these things are freaking delicious so I do rip off the top there we go they are resealable ok as you can see that the little ziplock and they are pretty sugary too but they do come in my favorite flavor red alright it's kind of like a cherry fruit punchy but yeah uh-huh like I said it's like a cherry fruit punch you get the sugar obviously because they are coated in sugar um but it does take like that earthy taste away that you get in regular CBD don't get me wrong it's still there but it's not bad at all and you know I mean you know it's not bad it's actually quite tasty I've been using these for a couple weeks now the next video I'm going to do on these will be the big the big bottle and I've been eating those at night now when your first pop them in your mouth and chew them up like I said you're gonna get the sugar you're gonna get like that little fruit punch cherry type flavor and then at the very end when you swallow and kind of let everything chill out that's when you're gonna get that little earthy tint of the CBD in there so you know it's in there but it's good by all means trust me it's good it doesn't make you make faces or anything it's good stuff if you want some and again I do suggest you get some do yourself a favor check the description below all right in the description gonna final link to these click the button a couple times put some in your cart put some on your doorstep and you can have some gummy bear

was you know hey YouTube YouTube YouTube at all he went out and did sessions in areas that you flied out we're not supposed to be in and he posted those things on his channel I mean the kids smoking the joint standing next to a sign that says private property no trespassing and then they recorded him going past that sign and hanging out on a trestle bridge now not only has he violated trespassing laws but he's also put himself at risk which is one of the things that YouTube has been cracking down on anybody doing outrageous stuff like that they're like no we don't care who you are they're gonna pull you any roads how are you thanks for joining us over there Facebook let well again it depends upon what they're doing what state they're in are they actual true medical patients or are they just individuals that are out here going ahead so they happen to try this and we'll see what it does oh yeah no no I know I know straight central I'm not saying that one oh yeah they they've been they've been cracking down hard on their rules they have absolutely now the other thing is and anybody who's at YouTube knows this YouTube's actually very good Jimmy dad's what's going on buddy man that was a great time yesterday absolutely had a blast at your location thank you very much for welcoming its all into your home yeah man I'm getting close I'm getting close although my sub number and it's weird it keeps fluctuating just a couple days ago it was at 954 or 955 yes Harold I do recall I'm good I'm glad to hear it work for you absolutely absolutely am I happy to hear that word but yeah the numbers here in YouTube as well as like the numbers and Facebook land I truly don't know how accurate they are when we look at of just eyes as a standing because of the way they fluctuate chairs by the way nice fresh cup of coffee but as I was saying know anybody who's in YouTube knows this if you do something if you violate a copyright if there's a not even violating copyright okay if there's a question if there's a problem YouTube sends you a letter they do send you an email now it's entirely up to you if you're gonna read that email and heed what's going on in it or even talk back with them and you don't get a dialogue going and make sure everything is okay so if people don't do that then yeah of course YouTube is just gonna be like well you know we've tried you're not talking back obviously they're gonna yank the channel again I know people that does that that has happened to and they themselves said that when they went and looked at the email account which was associated with their YouTube channel they ended up finding messages from YouTube themselves and like you know Alan there's spam folder or whatever but they did have notice his notification sent to them [Laughter] I mean literally knock on wood in all the years that I have been operating my channel I've never knock on wood never had a strike never had a problem I've never violated any Terms of Service I've never had any issues whatsoever I've been very very meticulous at that even doing what I'm doing now when I do my compound concentrates and coffee programs I make sure the music I play is cleared through YouTube and it's cleared through Facebook so I don't have to worry about getting locked up in jail [Laughter] I'm really curious man a CBD gummy frog now for the ones who don't know I talked about green roads before I have tried some of their products they have assorted different things and when I say they have an assortment they have a lot of products they really do they have everything from a CBD tea that you can drink some edibles to edibles to smoke balls they have shatters they have crumbles they have you know sublinguals that's what the the last piece that I will be testing from them is a sublingual goes under them under the tongue now all of their products - I know some people don't know about it they don't know how it's made they're like I've never heard of it so not a problem I've got you covered [Laughter] that will do that absolutely and I bet you you didn't drink some water before you laid down last night there's a big trick this is one thing man back when I in my days of drinking always always always make sure you have a glass or two of water before you because you will become dehydrated overnight in your sleep now I'll give people the breakdown of how they work their process I'll talk a little bit about this particular product and then I'm going to do my my eating so they're processing it's a five-step process they use certified organic hemp it's cultivated a process according to the highest industry standards it produces the most effective final products and of course they say only to find a stem plants meet their standards grow and without pesticides or GMOs we have broad-spectrum CBD meaning CBD CBG cbn plus terpenes they use a co2 extraction system to extract CBD from the hep plant-based through supercritical co2 now this extraction process takes co2 to a very low temperature under high pressure it gives it properties of both a liquid and a gas now this allows them to extract only the useful cannabidiol out of the plant matter leaving the THC behind once returned to room temperatures all the co2 evaporates leaving behind only the purest isolates now it's completely solvent free although they say it is expensive good morning ed how are you they say even though it is expensive the method is the industry's best practice for solvent free extraction so now they take that CBD isolate and they start out as a crystalline solid the crystalline CBD has been formulated and it's broken down and put into their CBD products its are independently tested so people don't have to worry about that they'll all row components are lab tested throughout the process and the final products are also lab tested for impotency they have over 20 years experience doing what they're doing working with lace and compounding pharmacists who transform their high quality raw materials into their green road finished product so it's there they're not just a fly-by-night company they're not somebody who just started out they have actually been around for a long time whoo yeah no I don't drink at all um I quit in 2010 I was around a bunch of people yesterday that were drinking they were having a good time and that's cool if that's your thing well yeah one of them just talked over at Facebook about how you know the the drink the moonshine that they were drinking kicked their ass all right CBD froggies 100 milligrams their edibles made up of corn syrup citric acid gelatin sugar and then infused with pharmaceutical grade cannabidiol CBD froggies have been infused with 100 milligrams of CBD terpenes are are considered the main building blocks of any plant essential oils and contribute to the set flavors and colors as we all know the blend appears CBD oil and broad-spectrum terpenes is a vegetable glycerin base and causes a powerful entourage effect with a unique floral flavor there see many froggies are made here in America and are developed by licensed pharmacists with again 20 plus years experience the 100 milligram CBD froggies are a low dosage of CBD if you're new to CBD the 100 milligrams CBD froggies are they say perfect choice they do actually have higher dosage now CBD uses CBD has been around for thousands of years by doctors to help in their patients now at the time science behind em couldn't explain why it works but they knew it did however they have their little you know their breakdowns or their products and they talk about how you know their patients believed it to be a very powerful plant with healing abilities even way back way now modern-day science explains the powers of happen why it's used as medicine years ago talking about the hemp plant producing compounds called cannabidiol switch we're all learning about these kendama dials help to create a balance in the cannabinoid system which is another thing they've only recently been discovering that is within all of us which is why you can have four or five individuals hanging around all smoking off a joint of the same product those four or five people can actually describe a different feeling because their body processes in different ways yes we all get that high affect we know that who doesn't love it however your body does take it and put it into this system naturally now they say your endocannabinoid system is out of balance that could lead to symptoms such as inflammation chronic pain headaches other more serious conditions as well and Santino how are you thanks for joining us over there facebook lands nice to see you now these symptoms and conditions come from clinical and academically deficiency which is c e-- c d they even give you a breakdown on the actual ingredients again corn syrup sugar gelatin citric acid natural flavors they even tell you you don't have to eat see red forty yellow 6 yellow five blue one gluten-free andrew Hyginus hemp oil and extract and employ oil now a lot of people ask well how much should i take that really depends upon you your system how your system processes and what you're taking it for so the one hundred milligrams really truly is a good like base all right whoo oh yeah I know smells like candy [Laughter] absolutely that's so funny all right guys and gals take a look at this thing it literally is a frog that's pretty funny well kind of nice pole throw it - I like that oh yeah I like that it's not one of the ones that just falls apart I've had a couple of products before that was just absolutely nasty I have done research on CBD for pets CBD for pets is an absolute amazing thing all right you definitely taste it you definitely know you're eating a medicated product there's no mistaking excuse me not a bad taste I'm not saying that but the initial it's like ooh candy and then you chew and then you're like ooh there's the medication not bad really isn't again nice candy taste definitely a medicated taste no mistaking it green runes now these particular ones you can actually pick up locally a lot of stores carry them however right in Milford right in Milford Connecticut puff City 874 Boston Post Road in Milford go on in and ask for ish if he's there he's the only one of the owners a great person talk to you very knowledgable knows about his products he carries a a decent wine of the green Rhodes products of course as always during my tests I don't play a lot of music but I do play one or two Sarge so mix you up a little something right now since I just ate that product and you know we'll say terrible chat for a few see how I feel dip down into the collection like I did yesterday a lot of people like yesterday's broadcast because it's artists that we've heard from but if all of those were songs that none of us had never heard before again that could depend upon the person it could be anything from within ten minutes - some people say could take up to 40 minutes it really does it's how your body processes things um I myself literally have had feelings for products since I do these tests first thing in the morning my system is nice and clean I have the the effects come on relatively quickly there's a tune from Otis McDonald it's called complicate yet green roads is in fact here in Connecticut that is correct absolutely there were some great bluesy tracks yesterday now dig it down a little deeper into my collections I've explained the people I'll play with people what I mean I get a lot of requests and I heard and I Advent which is why kind of I've had songs that come around that kind of stay of rotation because people like to hear however as it did you know the case of yesterday all right let's go for some of the deeper cuts I've got probably 3,000 or more tracks actually available that I could play both through Facebook and YouTube and be cleared not have to worry about going at Facebook jail or being YouTube strength now Bob Chad you were asking me about how long if you remember when I did the CBD lollipop from this company literally during my test while I was sitting here I even told people I did start to feel the medication within the 20 minute time period 25 minutes website for what I is a lot of websites so you got to be a little more specific all you're talking about for music right here in YouTube as well as Facebook they actually have these audio collections up anybody that has an account has access to these these songs and the artists allow you to not only play the songs actually they encourage you to download I mean they encourage you to use them use them as back tracks and videos use them as an underlying effect use them the way I do yep use them the way I do all right if you're in YouTube you log into your account go into your creator studio when you're in your creator studio on the left hand side there's a list of links you have dashboard video manager livestream community channel analytics so on and so forth well all the way in the bottom you see one that has like a little camera icon next to it and it says create yeah not so good there's that little link and it says create now if you click on that you're gonna see right in there the audio collections you'll find it and Facebook does the same thing I saw also one of the reasons why I've kind of not understood why I know people who have had themselves repeatedly put in facebook jail for finally to copyright music laws and then they go and they do it again so they Facebook violate some another time and then they go and they get locked up in facebook jail and then they get out and then they go and they do it again it's like come on guys really we don't learn now this is why I do it the way I do it I do not have an issue as a matter of fact it helps them out because I'm getting their songs and artists out in front of people who might have never heard before here's blues and abused coming out of are being sold or she were 23 minutes into my test now as everybody knows all my testing videos at the 30 minute mark I shut them down and then I come right back up and I start up compound on straights and coffee for today [Music] No no knocking attempted she it's fixed its thoughts like that to get people put in their facebook jail and YouTube jail or get copyright issues or gets little checks on their accounts I won't do that again in four years that I've been here I've never had an issue I am doing everything I'm doing and building this channel up I'm doing everything I'm doing building I'm compound concentration coffee yeah I'm not going to do stuff to you no risk putting this down and it's all good it's not like you hijacked anything you're asking questions that's what I'm here for [Music] [Music] [Music] and yeah that is one thing I've never liked about a lot of places is people look down their nose at cannabis but individuals who want to sit here and do alcohol and beer reviews you know and drink up oh hey that's cold [Music] [Music] pronounce my name which one are you talking to h7 let's just say my name is pretty simple all right okay I like the products available right here in Connecticut actually available anywhere I mean you can go online you can go to their website you can order that legally and they'll be shipped directly to your door now nice and easy or find yourself a local retailer and support local alright everybody fantastic I'm gonna be out of here Connecticut medical marijuana critic thank you very much for

and two to shut my stream down get things reset or restarted and I will be right back alright thank you very much for joining me today everybody peace so", "VjGQtcGgX7A": "hey everybody welcome back to my channel I'm ray thank you guys so much for watching in today's video we're gonna talk about something very very very interesting CVD but before we do I want you to subscribe to this channel first and also follow me on instagram ari why underscore mmm DL my Instagram page got hacked and I'm trying to build my following again so make sure you do that and now let's get right into the video so before we start talking about the CBD part I just want you to give you a background story of how like everything happened or how everything started so for about nine ten years now I've been like depending on coffee like crazy it got to the point where I was drinking coffee like way more than I was drinking water it was the only thing that I would drink that would allow me pretty much to get out of bed every single day every single morning and for me to focus on what I had to do it got to the point where I was drinking it so much that I'd know sort of like effect on me whatsoever so I would like still drink it but still feel sleepy and I was very anxious like all the time I was agitated super super impatient I didn't have no sort of like appetite whatsoever I was losing mad weight it got to the point where I got so so so skinny reduce my anxiety problems I started you know looking for things that I could take in order for me to be more relaxed and feel like a normal person all over again and there is wheat you know like people smoked but I honestly cannot stand the smell we'd and so that's when I discovered CBE I've tried other brands but the one that I'm gonna talk about right now is took it to a whole nother level lasting like a huge difference in my skin and then my mood and everything pretty much so now talking about CBD if you don't know what CBD or haven't heard about CBD I don't know like where have you been living it's been training everywhere for the past few years I think and if you don't know where CBD is CBD is a component of the cannabis plant however it has no THC whatsoever in it it has pretty much all the benefits of medical marijuana without the intoxicating effect and it helps a lot with insomnia pain and also anxiety which the brand that I'm actually gonna talk about is sugar and cush and the reason why I feel like I've been using this one is because everything is so yummy and they have like different alternatives so they have the cookies and the cookies has its gluten free dairy free 100% vegan it's all-natural you also have like the gummy bears and the gummy bears are honestly like one of my face like they taste they taste so good and in one bottle you have 30 gummies and you have also the CBD oils so the ones that I've got or cotton candy cotton candy and vanilla they taste so good so what I like about these is the fact that you have like different alternatives so so the way I do it every single day I would take one in the morning and one at night and I like the fact that they different alternatives so I can take one gummy in the morning and then take the CBD oil at night or even one cookie depending on how I feel and I would definitely recommend you to take one before like starting a stressful activity and usually whenever I take these I will start filling it after like let's say 25 to 30 minutes whenever I take it I feel like such a huge sense of like calmness and I focused so much better on my stuff it's like I'm easygoing and for some reason whenever I take the CBD or I feel like it acts faster so let me show you so this is the vanilla and candy my favorite one is that peanut head but the cotton candy you have 500 milligram CBD all in this bottle right here so the way I'll take it I was literally drop it on my tongue and then let it sit for like 10 seconds and then swallow with so let me show you you can actually add the CBD oil like in your food in your drinks depending on what you prefer I would say but I like to put it on my tongue and just I like to taste the oil I feel like and the gummy bears as well then I already ate one this morning but I'm just gonna eat it actually just for you guys down so you have like colorful gummy bears each one of them taste different it's chewy and doesn't it doesn't stick to your teeth at all you have the cookies I haven't tried the cookies yet let me try it so this is one of their cookies right here so you have 8 cookies in one pad and it's amazing oh my god well what I like the most about on sugar and push yourself but whenever you go on their website they have like a specific tab not like literally a whole list a whole report of each and every ingredient added into these products I would definitely recommend you taking CVD if you have problem with insomnia pain or anxiety especially on sugar and cush is definitely my go-to I'm the chip using it now and I'm probably gonna keep using it I mean they have different flavors I know that for the CBD or I only shows you the vanilla and cotton candy but they have so many other flavors that you can actually go on the website and check it out hey I just want you to know guys that all my reviews are honest I don't care how much I'm getting paid I would never lie just for me to get paid and when the products is pretty much cheap I just feel like it's supported for everybody to feel good in their own body so this has helped me and I hope that this video will help like some people

to lower our blood sugar in general twenty-nine point 1 million or more Americans are diabetic 86 million are pre-diabetic so we are in a sugar epidemic and it's directly with what we are eating we are over consuming sugar because it could be linked to things like heart disease weight gain tooth decay even high blood pressure so it's what you're eating that's extra that you have to be careful of and so we're trying to work on people to realize that yes having some sugar is fine by the way but we're eating too much sugar and so this book is trying to help people crash those sugar cravings cut them out right be able to eat regular food so the whole family can eat together by the way but also to feel like you are in control again because we are so out of control in this country so everyone should be getting their sugar checked at least once a year we're gonna do it right now Marnie's gonna come up Marnie come on come on over now hey guys so this is a random glucose test which means that anyone can do it at home it takes a little strip your sugar is varied throughout the day depending on when you've eaten or when you've not eaten and so the ranges can vary but this gives you a quick snapshot of where you are you want to be less than 140 reading on this so less than one that's 140 over 140 up to 199 you could be pre-diabetic if you're 200 or more you may be diabetic you need further testing well and by the way diabetics should at least get tested three times a year maybe more check with your doctor like choose an IV - IV yes so this is very simple it's a little prick okay thank you for volunteering you do like this a little machine here you press down a little bit well prick like that that's all it takes then you squeeze a little the blood out like that put it on this strip like so and then in five seconds it reads what your blood sugar is 113 so wonder is good that's grassland that's excellent [Applause]", "y0iRtNf13bE": "- Hey growers, I'm back and I'm between the two Grobos and I've\ngot some gummy bears. They've completed our recipe\nand they're ready to show off, so it's a little bit of show and tell now. I coated them with a\nlittle bit of refined sugar because they were quite\nsticky coming out of the mold, but they're really nice and sweet and nice and powerful. (upbeat music) Okay, the first step we're gonna do is we're gonna add the powder of the Zen Zingers Cherry Bomb. To that we're gonna add 45 milliliters of reverse osmosis water, and we're gonna stir this up really well. The instructions say\nto use a wooden spoon, but I don't have a wooden\nspoon here in the office, so I've selected this\nbeautiful metal spoon to use. This is on a medium high heat to begin. Once it's all combined, we're\ngoing to go with a lower heat. We want it to continue to boil, but we don't want it to boil too much. Now that it's boiling, I'm going to set my timer for four minutes and we're not gonna touch it. So we are not gonna stir\nit any more at this point, but we have turned the temperature down. Once four minutes is up, we'll be back. Okay, so that was four minutes. So we're going to take the\nconcoction off of the heat. Now we're going to add the cannabis oil. If you'd like to see how\nto make cannabis oil, check out our video in the link below. I'm going to add this whole\nportion of cannabis oil. I've made this before. It's nice and strong. We're gonna be making\n15 of these little guys. Great, now I'm gonna use the syringe to fill up some of these\nlittle smiley face cavities. I'm going to fill 'em\nthree quarters of the way and I'll come back and top 'em all off. Once that's done, we're going to put these\ninto the fridge for 24 hours. Then we're going to\ncover 'em in table sugar, store 'em in a flat container, and they'll be ready to consume. So that's the end of our gummy bear video, but we also have a couple of\nother videos you can check out.

(upbeat music)", "68grx1czDhY": "[Music] [Music] yes everyone dr sean miravichy here and welcome to a very special edition of dr shawn's cannabis product reviews i'm here on bass lake in beautiful muskoka here in northern ontario and what better setting to do a product review than this you know here on the dock on the lake and so let's uh let's get to it what i've done is i brought a few cannabis products that i haven't tried up with me to the cottage and so today i'm going to be trying the afirma peach gummy so a little bit of a back story about afroma they are a brand under the license producer uh i forgot the name title health solutions they're located in new brunswick this gummy is 10 milligrams of thc it retails for seven dollars 68 cents on the ontario cannabis store i actually picked mine up at my local dispensary miss jones where it was nine dollars so a little bit of a mark up there but i guess you are if you're just buying one or two items uh you save on the shipping costs uh rather than buying it on the ontario cannabis store you can go into a dispensary save on the shipping costs uh there will be a little bit of a markup but you know it all kind of balances out i you know my my thinking is if you're buying a whole bunch of items it makes more sense to purchase off the ontario cannabis store but if you're only buying one or two items uh probably more uh worth it to go into a local dispensary and buy them there okay back to the product so the extract in this edible is made from a hybrid strain and what's uh unique about this product and i guess afroma in general is they're using a full spectrum extract meaning that while you have thc in there you're going to have all the minor cannabinoids from the original plant you're going to have the terpenes and the flavonoids in there as well so i'm actually a big fan of full spectrum extracts because you have this entourage effect or the synergy happening between all the different cannabinoids and the terpenes and the flavonoids which in turn help the help prolong the effect of the thc and the cannabinoids as well as mitigating some of the side effects of the cannabinoids so it's it's always going to be the best result when you go with a full spectrum or even a broad spectrum extract tidal health solutions and afroma they also have a couple other flavors so this is the peach flavor but they have a grape a sour cherry a watermelon and i think i've got them all they also do topicals and they have some dried flour as well okay so let's get into it i haven't so this is going to be a different sort of format because i haven't even opened it i haven't tried it yet so what i'm going to do is i'm going to open the package i'm going to try it i'll tell you about the flavor right off the bat and then i'll wait until the effects set in and i'll take it from there so i'll give you some information about how long it took for the effects to set in and how long they're lasting can't really control for airplane noise so i apologize if you hear that in the background okay typical of most uh gummies and edibles that come in a package like this you'll have to peel off the top there'll be sort of a perforated area indicating where to peel from so we'll do that in there here's the duties paid sticker so now you know it's illegal uh all right now these are the tricky zip lock systems um so there's a child safety lock so a little bit harder to open than your typical zip lock so i'm going to do my best to get that open i sort of like to dig in and tack it as best as i can from the top there we go all right got that open so yeah with these things there's uh if you go for the top area of the ziploc that's the easiest place to get it open from all right so it's kind of uh of sad looking inside let me see if i can show you guys ah there's one lonely gummy in there i'll take it out there it is there's your peach gummy right there uh looks like there's some sugar crystals on the outside um it's very soft and it's quite flat okay let's try it out so good consistency it's not too chewy i've had edibles that basically break your jaw they're so chewy this is good the flavor is really full body so you do get that peach flavor but you definitely get a strong hit of a sort of cannabis like a bit of the bitterness the terpenes the oils really sort of hits you after the first couple chews so don't expect this to be a super sweet one-dimensional peach flavor you definitely get hit with the canvas flavor in there which you know i've commented on in other videos can be a good thing can be a bad thing those people who are new to cannabis and might throw them off a little bit they're not used to that flavor but those that are quite familiar with canvas might like it because you know it definitely brings that cannabis flavor forward and you get to experience all the different subtle notes of the terpenes in there okay so that is that and we'll see how long this takes to have effect right now it is 11 25 a.m and i'll be back and let you know how long this took to have its effect just lost the package all right i'll see you soon [Music] oh hey guys i'm back so it's been about five hours since i took the edible the onset came on pretty quickly like within about 30 minutes i started really feeling the effects and i would say it peaked for me at around an hour and a half after taking the gummy and the effects lasted until very recently so i would say a good like four to five hour stretch the effects were also pretty hard-hitting like this one was pretty powerful one of the most hard-hitting uh edibles that i've tried and maybe that's due in part to the entourage effect of that full spectrum extract i don't know but um so i'm going to have to rate this let's see so it all in all really good product i would say that you know for nine dollars like at a dispensary it was around seven dollars from the ocs i would say it's a touch pricey but either than that really good effect uh really hard hitting good length of time the taste was you know it's going to be such an individual thing like i didn't mind it but it's gonna throw off some people for sure so i'm gonna take one off um for taste and one off for price so i'm gonna give this one a solid eight out of ten so that's it for now dr sean signing off i'll be back with another product review for you shortly please as always if you like these reviews if you find them helpful if you want to see more reviews better reviews please subscribe to my channel really motivates me to get working for you guys so i'll see you soon", "ufr2SU18_WE": "[Music] the cbd gummy bears are ideal for cannabis lovers who love to try cbd edibles the gummy bears are infused with

seaweedy for the first time and let me tell you it does everything that they claimed that it does now I have a friend who is an affiliate and she sells CBD oils and I listened to what she had to say but I never really bought into it so it was out of my price range for something that probably would not work so I went to the gas station and they were selling a bunch of CBD stuff and they had this little thing CBD gummies and you know there's five of them in a pack and they're not that expensive like at all so why not it's gummies they can be delicious whatever so I decided to give them a try and the reason I tried to give them a try is I have horrible back pain horrible like degenerative disc disease horrible and sometimes it's crippling and I just I don't like taking pain pills I don't like taking a fistful of Tylenol every couple hours I don't like taking a couple naproxen I don't like taking advil I don't like taking the elite I don't like prescription pain pills they just eventually don't work for me they might work for you which is whatever but I tried these I only ate one only ate one and almost instantly my back's doctor and almost instantly took like probably like 12 minutes five minutes something like that but was almost instantly and it was like holy [ __ ] this is a miracle it's I took one they gave me the same amount of relief that to naproxen eight tylenols you know that a fistful of medications would take only one it only took one and it's been about 30 hours right now and my back still feels pretty good and I've only eaten one so I'm a believer and if you don't believe me do like I did and go and get you a little small pack out of gas station they're sold everywhere now so they're pretty easy to find and give it a try you might be out like 10 bucks if it doesn't work for you or you could be like me and you be completely astounded that something so small worked and it wasn't even doctor prescribed it was just word of mouth so believe the hype people get you some CBD for for some pain relief for some stress for anything that they say that it works for I promise you it works it works for me and I mean look at these you're not not a bad-sized gummy you know it's normal size giving me and the taste they taste phenomenal but then there's an aftertaste kind of like a little aftertaste whatever it's not bad it's not horrible it's not unbearable mmm but there you have it just try it I'm a believer I'm a believer you should be a believer get you some CBD and if you don't know it CBD is that's cannabis oil hemp oil there's no THC in it it's not a drug it's pretty pretty normal nowadays see sizzle oh no no no teach-in yeah you probably can't see it because it's [ __ ] tiny but there's no THC in it it's it's not bad give it a try and you'll be surprised at how well it works well whatever they're telling you it works work is it [ __ ] works", "BEe0Urc7S00": "hi guys alright so this video should appeal to

gummies these guys are sold for 49.99 and there are 60 gummies per pack but each gummy is only packed with 5 milligrams of CBD that's one of the lower dosage and it's a great option if you're just getting started with CBD these are mixed berry flavored and they're also vegan the other product is the CBDs melatonin gummies for sleep so obviously these should be taken right before you go to bed and these will help you get a good night's rest so same price and same amount of gummy bears per pack except these gummy bears are loaded with 10 milligrams of CBD and 5 milligrams of melatonin the flavor is juicy lemon and of course they are also vegan last but not least the just CBDs gummies now these are for those who are dead serious about CBD gummies this 3,000 milligrams jar contains about 220 gummy bears packed with thirteen point five milligrams of CBD each so if you're taking a few of these daily then this could be a really good option to buy in bulk but you don't have to stick to

each so anyways see you guys later bye bye", "njWP70F7L3c": "[Music] you [Music]", "yEq-IosJLHY": "hello everyone present-day Stephanie here so I found this video a few days before the protest began because of the murder of George Floyd and I didn't know when an appropriate time was to post this video because I clearly do not want to be insensitive to everything that's happening right now but like many of you I have been glued to my phone social media the news and also the last you know I guess how many days I've been I've been out and about at the protests in downtown LA and Hollywood as well and the other day I honestly needed a mental break after coming home from the protest it's been very emotional and powerful but I did need to just I ended up watching some Gordon Ramsay and then I watched him RuPaul so what I was saying is I I think it's okay to take a little bit of a mental break this is something that so many of us hopefully all of us watching this right now are just so passionate about and mad about and and ready to fight to make change for which is already happening but also we need to be able to recharge as well a little bit so I'm not saying that watching a video like this is necessarily an escape but a little bit of a mental break and a little bit of a ability to recharge and then get back out there and do what you can I also did reach out and speak to some of my subscribers out there and asked if this was an appropriate thing to do and they kind of voice the same feelings that I am feeling right now so clearly YouTube videos are a lot more plan they're not necessarily in the moment and right now with what's happening everything is so in the moment it's changing so rapidly so if you want to catch up with me and see what I'm doing in the present moment you can catch me on Instagram I'm posting on there quite a bit any Adsense made from this video I'm going to be donating to blacklivesmatter and I'm planning for at least the month of June any videos I make adsense there I will be donating to an organization affiliated with black lives matter and I also have a very important message at the end of this video that I personally would love more information about and I do need to learn more about and I feel like as a community we need to as well so please stick till the end of the video and yeah I hope you all are staying safe out there I love you all and enjoy what's up everyone AC girl Stephanie and today I am gonna share with y'all some of my favorite CBD products I've been a big fan of CBD for quite some time now is really impacted my life positively as well as other people all around me and Josie's too so before we get into it if you haven't yet please make sure to subscribe below come join the sisterhood no matter your true pronoun or gender identity come join the family alright let's get started okay so before we get into the products let's talk a little bit about what CBD is so CBD stands for cannabidiol which is a chemical compound derived from the cannabis sativa plant aka marijuana CBD is non psychoactive meaning it does not have a strong effect on the brains cognitive activity and doesn't cause the hive associated with marijuana and in fact has been found to have a lot of great health benefits currently there is so much research going on with CBD in terms of cancer research epilepsy but in terms of just 182 CBD in daily life I think I have four health benefits that you know anybody out there would use CBD for these ones I personally use them for so here we go I have pain relief so studies have shown that CBD may help reduce chronic pain by impacting endocannabinoid receptor activity reducing inflammation interacting with neurotransmitters we have anxiety and depression reduction so CBD acts on the brains receptors for serotonin which is a neurotransmitter that regulates mood and social behavior third we have sleep aid so one study showed that CBD improved the symptoms of REM sleep behavior disorder a disorder in which a person acts out in their dreams RBD is associated with poor sleep and nightmares and then in terms of on the outside personally we have acne treatment so CBD oil may help treat acne due to its anti-inflammatory properties and ability to reduce sebum production and also there's a lot of research on CBD in terms of other skin issues like really dry skin eczema and that kind of stuff so those are really the health benefits that I guess I'm gonna be talking about with these particular products and of course we have different ways of using we have ingestion and topical so we're really gonna go through a variety of different products here we're gonna start this off with ingested CBD and this is probably the form that I use the most and these are gummies so here are my favorite ones in particular this is by plus and as you can see I have different kinds here so if we're just starting off with two of these here these are 700 milligrams the CBD per 10 there's 14 gummies in here so that means our 50 milligrams of CBD per gummy that is a lot for a gummy product I actually have now tried and maybe over like 10 different brands of gummies and these are quite small but for me this brand tastes the best but also because there's so much CBD in there and you can taste it a little bit more it's a little bit more bitter obviously with so much packed in there you're not gonna avoid the flavor or like the terpenes of the plant itself so typically because this is 50 all like cut this in half or even into quarters sometimes or you know eat one whole I want to I started taking CBD because of anxiety I definitely deal with daily presence of anxiety I don't think that I have the high some anxiety ever at all but I feel like as a normal person we're all dealing with anxiety you know what issues within our own lives all the time the way that my anxiety Manifest is I just feel like I'm going a million miles an hour while I'm doing nothing and I'll like hold my breath really and I just get really tense and I don't even realize I'm doing it I have to consciously just like let it go CBD really really helps with that it just helps me just relax a little bit and just slow down has absolutely no effect on my brain function like I said or anything it just makes me just relax a little bit more so that's when I started eating these gummies I really like these but the ones I really like these are my favorite just CBD gummies are these ones they are 90 milligrams CBD and 10 milligrams THC now there's a lot of research out there currently that says that CBD is more effective when you have a little bit of THC with it and this is called the entourage effect and it kind of shows that in terms of like the chemical compounds of the plant they work better together than as their individual components so that's why when you look at a product that contains CBD it'll either be full-spectrum broad spectrum or isolate I'm really not going to go too far into that because this is a lot to talk about but I'll just say that full spectrum does have a little bit of THC in there legally for it to be just sold everywhere it has to have under 0.3% I believe so this one is not legal to be sold everywhere I had to get this from a dispensary because in terms of like one dummy actually there's point five milligrams of THC you don't feel it at all when you're eating this one but I do feel like this one in itself gives me the same relaxed feeling the feeling of calm as one of these so this one only has four point five milligrams of CBD per gummy this one has 50 milligrams so I really do believe in that entourage effect there is one more from this company that I think it's worth talking about this is their melatonin gummy this one is 25 milligrams of CBD per gummy one milligram of melatonin so it is a very low amount of melatonin per gummy I find that eating one of these has the same effect as eating like a melatonin pill and I want to say usually those are like five milligrams of melatonin so I really like to use this I don't eat melatonin super regularly but I do have racing thoughts sometimes like I said my anxiety can carry like into the night so sometimes taking something like this really does help and I will say that in terms of like whole flour marijuana or something like that I do use like a little indica pen to go to sleep as well that's pretty much my the scent of my marijuana usage but of course I live in California and it's all legal I use it to help me go to sleep but sometimes if I just have this I don't need that the pen at all I do know on their website you can purchase any of these separately and you can also buy these three as a pack which I did and like I said I had to get the one with th seed a little bit of THC and they're from a dispensary another brand of gummies that I do enjoy our CBD effects and this brand in itself has so many options for CBD they have got like gummies tinctures everything so and I believe on the site that might even have packs you know that you can have a variety pack of different things so if you're just looking into like diving into CBD and just trying whatever you want this is a great company to go to I like the concert or this one and itself too because it's pretty small pack I think they're like eight gummies or there were four gummies no eight gummies in here these ones for only five milligrams per gummy so you're not going crazy oh oh like going 50 milligrams and you don't have to obviously cut it up all by yourself so if you're really very new to CBD I think this is a a brand to look into I think that they have one like small pack like this left and it's there like spirulina you're not gonna get this specific flavor but you're gonna get the same like five milligrams CBD gummies another thing actually that I really do want to circle back to about doing your research is you really have to look at the ingredient list in the back and if you can't see it if they're not displaying it on the website do not buy from that website because there are some brands they label their CBD like gummies in particular like extra chil CBD and actually they've added melatonin to it without telling you explicitly on the packaging like you look at this one it's called sleep blackberry tea with melatonin there was one brand that my sister really liked no where on the packaging did it say CBD with melatonin but she was like Stephanie these ones are so good for sleep every time I just eat one of these gummies it knocks me out right away and I was like whoa that sounds like it's a little bit too relaxing but maybe my sister's just very sensitive to CBD so I bought it and I remember it was like 5:00 p.m. I was working on my computer and maybe like 45 minutes later I was like I'm so tired right now what's going on at first it felt like I was just like really relaxed so I was like this is crazy this did not have that much CBD in it and also like it's making me not just relax but really sleepy then I just went ahead and looked at the packaging and you know back here it said melatonin I was just shocked because I went on the website on the page of the gummi know we're on there to say anything about melatonin until you went to this teeny little ingredient list at the very bottom area that you had to like click a tab for and then under everything it said melatonin so just do your research and look over everything before buying a product and if a product doesn't explicitly say that has something like melatonin in it I'm not sure if I would trust that brand so next up after gummies the product that I use the most are tinctures so I have two here for you I have one by Lorde Jones this is their royal oil a thousand milligrams CBD and then I have this one by anda which is their full-spectrum CBD hemp extract now the Lord Jones royal oil is advertised as being topical and I do use it in that way as well but I didn't have the pleasure of meeting one of the cofounders of Lord Jones Cyndi Capobianco and she did tell me that this isn't just about as well because all that's in here is I believe grapeseed oil and the CBD oil one dropper pool is 40 milligrams of CBD so maybe I'll you know do half put it underneath my tongue and just hold it there for a minute if you're really not trying to mess with a lot of added ingredients you don't want you know any sugars or anything from the gummies this could be a great way to go and it is a very multifunctional product because I do have some neck shoulder pain issues and this is a product this is the first really effective CBD product that I found to really help with my my pain in my neck I think especially topically the thing that I really grasp about CBD is that it reduces inflammation and inflammation can be the cause of a lot of bodily issues in terms of pain management skin issues a lot of it has to do with inflammation and this product actually what they recommend is to use it in your skincare so you could put it in your moisturizer a little drop of that or even end it just on your face but like I said this one I use mostly for ingestion and if I were to put it topically like on my shoulder and then this one by and I just wanted to mention it because I haven't used it too much but I have seen a friend who does like this brand I need to look into it a little bit more I believe actually the all the packaging has changed very drastically since I received this one but if you are looking into another brand if you look into this one if you just don't want to taste anything at all you don't want to deal with any oils you don't want to deal with any gummies we have capsules here for you of course so I have two here where I'm from CBD effects again it's one these little envelopes there is 25 milligrams of CBD per capsule and then we have a little jar here of the Lord Jones hemp derived CBD gel capsules this one as well has 25 milligrams of CBD per capsule you know in terms of all these methods of ingestion it really comes down to I guess just your preference personally for me a lot of CBD is about the process I guess and it is I hey it's the word of like mindfulness of understanding that I am you know rubbing this thing on me or eating this thing to help calm me down or to help me in some way so I enjoy that aspect of CBD cuz it makes me kind of focus and be like okay just chill out this is what I'm trying to do to help myself so it's a little bit of a self-care moment if you don't need that moment for yourself like go ahead and just take a capsule or you know this could be that process for you as well I personally have not used these too much because I enjoy using the other ways but I have gifted these to friends you know a bunch of these in the bottle I have gifted to a friend and they were dealing with some real pain issues in their back and they said that this one really helped them along with other products I did give them though I'll talk about the other one in a sec it but yeah this is just a way that you'd want to ingest EBD go ahead and try it in terms of incorporating CBD into your daily life I have been enjoying some these products that make it even more of I guess like a ritual so I have a couple honey products here so this first one is from potli this is their cannabis infused raw honey this has 100 milligrams of CBD and 10 milligrams of THC so this is another one of those that you might have to purchase from a dispensary I believe this one is only sold in California and again because it has the little bit of THC in there you get that entourage effect to make it a little bit more effective this is something that I would put into you know anything that you want honey some tea you put it on some granola it just incorporates CBD in another way into your daily life without maybe making it feel so Medical like you're not taking a tincture or a capsule you just have it in your honey and this honey tastes great this brand potli is wonderful the founders are fell and Christine very are my Faria girls and I feel like they're killing it I have another product here from them that I want to talk about this is a product that I really really like and then if you're looking for one that has absolutely no teach C in there that you could just purchase online this one is from iki pers natural this is their beat chill raw honey and hemp there is 500 milligrams high potency hemp oil which is CBD in there I actually personally know the founder of bee keepers Naturals as well which is so cool so now I've talked about three female or four female founders but her name is Carly Stein she started bee keepers naturals because she actually has grown up has lived with her whole life with an autoimmune disorder and she found that natural bee products like propolis and royal jelly and I guess now added with CBD actually really helps with her extra so you're looking for just a really nice honey that has some CBD in there as well but no THC you can look into this one I have one more food product here again from potli and this is their hemp infuse extra virgin olive oils so this is cold-pressed estate Tuscan olive oil with 250 milligrams of hemp derived CBD again just one of those products where you can put it on to a salad you know just put it into your daily life and this olive oil is like really really delicious this is my highlight my special occasion not a special occasion but I wouldn't I would not cook with this olive oil I would use it for something raw I mean my favorite dressing for our salad would be some olive oil and some nice balsamic vinegar and we're good to go so you're fairly new to CBD and the idea of taking a pill or gummy or something is not practical for your life but you are a tea drinker or you're a salad eater you know this could be the form that would fit into your lifestyle earlier I mentioned my friend who I gave these capsules to who was having some really bad back problems I'm not sure it she it was like a pinched nerve feeling but she's not positive that's what it was but it made her very immobilize some of this one for her to put on topically and this is the bebo therapy's high potency CBD body balm there is 750 milligrams of CBD in this jar so topically what this balm claims to do is to reduce inflammation so if you're having just general body aches maybe just from working out this is a product that you could rub onto your muscles to help you out the other day Michael had a really weird back spasm it happened while he was bike riding and thankfully he wasn't that far away I think he was just like in Chinatown so I had to drive and go pick him up like he could not move his back was in so much pain it was actually really scary but when we go home he took a hot shower and then I rubbed this on its back for him oh no it was it was like his shoulder within his shoulder blade down his back you know some it was really weird but I rub this onto him for like half an hour and what they do recommend is to keep this on for at least half an hour and I think that it really helped obviously it's a combination of things like he took a hot shower clearly I'm giving him a massage which I think in itself helped there are other ingredients in here a lot of really nice oils that could help but in itself as a balm I feel like it does give some relief the CBD in there gives some real relief in terms of physical aches and pains this one plus the Royal oil are ones that I personally have used on my back and my neck for the pains that I have and you know when you're rubbing it on yourself you clearly can't really work it in and I personally have felt just that strain and my neck down to my shoulder just like loosen up after having this on for an hour it just says it just feels so much better even now like I still have the issues if I'm doing this all I'm hearing is just like I can't got crack all throughout my back you know just when I'm on my computer I'm hunched over and that's my tension as well that's my stress I I carry all in my shoulders and I hold my breath when I'm doing stressful things so all of it all CBD kind of helps me with those issues without having you know necessarily to take the next step into taking other things I will say this bomb is not the most friendly in terms of soaking into the skin it definitely is one that's great for massages because you can just keep working working working with it it does not soak in that well but that just means that a little bit goes a really long way because if you just use a teeny tiny bit of it it will obviously spread thin and soak in but it just is it's just I know it smells great it's a really nice bomb but yeah be careful if I don't know laying down on your white sheets or anything because it does a little bit of a tint on there and if you're slathering it on you know clearly you see that it has a color to it we're gonna jump into some other skin care products before we really hop into the face stuff there's another bomb here by Lord Jose and this is their high CBD formula body balm and this has 200 milligrams of CBD in there so you know this one over here has 750 this is 200 I would say if you are looking for something for aches and pains and those kind of things for inflammation of the muscles this is one that I would more recommend this one I don't even think that they don't claim anything about helping your muscles or helping aches and pains this one is just like a balm that you would put on for really dry skin the thing that lower John's really talks about in terms of CBD with this product is that it is very soothing and very a restorative ingredient and it is really good for dry cracked skin so especially now that we are all washing our hands so much using so much hand sanitizer this is the kind of product that like at the end of the day I'll like rub on my knuckles and my cuticles of course like I said with the previous product there are other ingredients within this like beeswax and oils that do help with that I think this product is a good example of how CBD can be really incorporated into your regular products in your everyday life it's not a miracle ingredient every single time they're claiming in this one that is just good for you know maybe some dry skin some cracked skin it's not going to solve your arthritis or anything so just do your research I guess on the product with CBD that you're purchasing so I have two more skincare products here another one from Lourdes Jones I just you know I think Lourdes Jones is maybe was the first CBD brand to go into Sephora they really did break out in the high-end skincare realm I really don't know a lot of other skincare brain ants that have CBD in them so that's why there's so much Lord Jones products if you have any recommendations for me please let me know in terms of CBD skincare clearly I have a lot of other brands that I like with CBD but I just haven't seen much CBD skincare that I really like because Lord Jones uses some really awesome ingredients outside of the CBD but yeah if you have any recommendations for me please let me know the thing in terms of skincare from Lord Jones I think I really like I really really like the most and this is probably the newest one for me is their whole plant formula acid mantle repair this is a CBD moisturizer this is quite a rich cream I am an oily person this is good for all skin types so typically this is my nighttime cream and it's this is gonna last me a long time because I've been using this for a minute and it looks like I haven't even really skimmed the surface you don't need that much at all along with the CBD there are some really great ingredients there's hyaluronic acid so it's highly moisturizing but because it does have the CBD in there it is really a restorative kind of ingredient it is great for acne and it's so funny because I do really love just scrolling through online reviews whether they be really bad or really good and it's it's awesome because on Sephora there are so many positive comments about this from people who look dry skin people who have acne prone skin it just seems like an all-around great very positively reviewed product so if you're looking for a really nice nighttime moisturizer if you are oily or disah all day everyday moisturizer if you got dry skin yeah this is just a really great straightforward moisturizer and the last product for the face that I have here is the Saint Jane luxury beauty serum again this is kind of one of those products that supposed to be for all skin types it has 500 milligrams a full spectrum CBD with 20 potent botanicals so it supposed to hydrate detoxify help with dullness uneven skintone wrinkles it's just kind of supposed to be yeah a miracle serum I haven't been using it for that long but I will say I feel like my skin is glowing afterwards I did have some breakouts that I had like I want to say they started like a week and a half ago I really consistently was using both of these at nighttime and my chin is just like really cleared up and I thought that there was gonna be more popping up but it did kind of back back then they went back in there so I'm gonna continue using this one I would say out of any of the skin products this is the one that I've used the least and it is also the most luxury product that I have here so I'm really being stingy with it but also again from all the reviews that I've read online a lot of different people with different skin types really have been enjoying this product hi Joe I just woke Josie up from snoring heavy sometimes when I'm recording now she just starts snoring so loud that I do have to I have to wake her up because she's just right here in front of the camera well speaking of Josie we do have a product for her this is the blossom full spectrum hemp oil this has 300 milligrams per bottle here this is the one I purchased for medium dogs you administer 0.25 milliliters per 25 pounds of pet weight CBD for pets is super effective I I feel like it might even be the most friendly gateway into CBD for a lot of people because they see immediate effects in their pets whether it be giving it to them during you know hard car rides where dogs have a lot of anxiety during that time or with fireworks so there was one night for some reason that there was a bunch of fireworks going on all outside Josie was a little bit nervous she's not usually nervous about loud noises but I think Michael wasn't around so it made her a bit nervous and I gave her some of the CBD and she calmed right down it was very I don't know it was pretty amazing and I have you know babysat other dogs where they're really anxious dogs and CBD just helps so much so I feel like just in that to see how CBD works for your loved animal and how it calms them down is just a really great testament to how effective CVD can be for you it's all not saying that everything you would give your dog is be good for you but I'm just saying we have a direct example there I do like this brand I feel like there are a lot of CBD for pet brands and a lot of the brands that I'm showing here let me see I know this one onda I saw on their website they have one specifically for dogs so I feel like a lot of brands that make CBD is just smart for them to also make it for pets as well so I would definitely recommend tinctures I'm not so sure about treats but I'm sure those are you know also effective I just have one last form of CBD not for pets but for humans and that is just the flower here so these are from Lowell smokes first off I have their premium hemp smokes so you can actually buy these from Lowell smokes it's just hemp and in this pack they also give you these little matches the packaging little smokes just kills it with the packaging is very very smart and I have gone through a good number of these little pre-rolls like I said I feel like for me personally part of CBD is the ritual and I am NOT a big just like weed smoker like I went sit down and smoke I was gonna say blunt I wouldn't go it's a ton of smoke a lot maybe you know back in my bay area days maybe but I went to sit down and smoke a joint on any given day but I do enjoy that process of sitting down lighting it and just relaxing with it so in a way I can I can have that without the high and we have it here with these CDP rolls if you don't want to have a whole approval because I understand I'll usually have to just like smoke a little bit of it put it out and then doesn't necessarily taste that great you know when you have to relight a joint they also just have the flower so this right here is 3.5 grams or 1/8 of the CBD hemp flour it's just crazy because in my mind like this just this is weak but yeah there's no THC in there it is just CBD is just hump and you can put this in your little pipe and smoke it so that's another option for you if you just really want to have that also I feel like if you're trying to not smoke so much weed but you enjoy that process this could be a great thing you know for you to do just smoke a little CBD so you're you're you having your ritual but you're not getting super stoned all right all those are all of my CBD products I have to show you it was a lot but I wanted to give you some options and I honestly I didn't realize that I really use a lot of sea wheedies so I hope you enjoyed this video before we close this up I did want to touch upon this in that you know currently marijuana is legal in California and in a lot of other states decriminalized in certain states I believe and it really is moving quite rapidly a lot of people a lot of companies are making a ton of money now in this industry and yet there are still thousands of people currently incarcerated for charges as small as carrying marijuana just possession and as a user of these products we need to be mindful and understand and become educated and become advocates for people who are currently in jail for crimes that are no longer criminal and I mean shouldn't not have been criminal in the first place I know myself I need to become more educated on the subject so I would love to hear from you any suggestions for anything that all of us should read about any kind of information or charities or organizations that we should look into because there's there's a lot of information out there but it's hard to really weep through it so I would love your help on that and I would love to be more educated and with that said I hope y'all are well and hope you are staying healthy and safe there's a lot of stuff going on right now and I hope this video maybe gave you a little bit of a break from that and I love you and I will see you in the next video bye", "sLaUTwNTjpQ": "hi twon extras karen leblanc here host of gen xtra bringing you one of my must-have

especially long term health benefits of it if you've got anxiety or some sort of pain yin and it good for pain relief and all that and you may not take it every day but I've also heard about short

questions lots of emails about delta 8 and i thought instead of responding to them all individually i'll just create a 5 minute video talking about everything delta 8 hopefully this answers all of your questions and then some so first of all let's get right into it what is delta nine i assure you that you do know delta nine also known as delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol is thc thc that cannabinoid responsible for the psychoactive effect of cannabis so what is delta 8 well delta 8 is another of the 150 cannabinoids found inside of the plant it is native to the cannabis flower but it is made in fractions of a percentage it is not as abundant as delta 9 thc when you look at the molecular structure of delta 8 and delta 9 you will see that they are very very similar however when you consume them you realize that they're different for one thing delta 8 has a much lower psychotropic potency than delta 9. now notice i did not say it's not psychoactive when you give this to a patient it is very likely that they will feel a change it will feel an effect so we like to say that delta h has its own unique feeling it feels like what delta eight feels like it's hard to compare it to delta nine but patients wanna know what does it feel like so how can we describe that feeling of delta eight this is how i talk about it when i consume delta 8 i feel clear-headed i am lucid thinking i can concentrate i am focused and in the sound i am not foggy i don't have any paranoid thoughts i'm not impaired however i still have that general feeling of wellness that i have when i use cannabis i feel calm at peace content i might feel it from the ice down depending on how much of it i take but i just have all the benefits without that mental impairments right so who likes delta eight when i worked at the shop i remember golfers love delta aids cyclists hikers caregivers people who need to be productive for part of their day which is a lot of people it's important to realize that people who like delta 9 and people who like delta 8 can be the same person the what your patient is looking for on a friday night is not necessarily the same thing he or she is looking for on a wednesday morning to get ready for finals or to get ready for work so it's really a great tool for everybody's belt what are some of the medicinal benefits that you may experience when you use delta eight for one thing you may feel a release intention and anxiety it could be a sleep aid it could even protect your brain cells but one thing i hear overwhelmingly from butt tenders and patients alike is that it is great for nausea anytime you hear a patient talk about nausea not being able to eat think delta eight grab that delta eight for that you could be changing somebody's quality of life i'm not gonna get into it here but i really encourage you to check out a study from hebrew university in jerusalem israel where they studied the effects of delta 8 on pediatric patients who were suffering from the side effects of chemotherapy now let's talk about the item 9 labs delta 8 line we have cartridges and capsules the capsules are 14 milligrams and they come in a pack of 10 so that's 140 milligrams of delta 8. the cartridges come in c cell half gram or 500 milligram cartridges they're about 80 to 85 percent delta eight thc and they come in a wide variety of flavors we just released three new flavors that's cool breeze strawberry fields and lychee lychee is my favorite but they're all really really great these are complex flavors that taste really well you don't get tired of them they don't make they're not like overly sweet they have a lot of depth to them i'm really impressed with them if you have tried delta a talk about it with your peers um remember just really remember delta eight and nausea that is such an important thing all right well that's all i'm close to the five minutes so i'm gonna leave it at that keep sending me your emails keep sending me your questions i will post my email at the end of this video you guys have a great day okay bye bye", "-xs4ySDGV00": "[Applause] [Music] the delicious CBD gummies by paradise infused are one of the most popular

my name is lauren if you're new here and i do tons of reviews on all kinds of things today i am sharing with you one of my favorite brands of cbd products and that is joy organics so as you can see here i have the cbd oil and i have the cbd soft gels which is just like a capsule and i have the cbd gummies so these are like my go-to cbd products any brand that i use that i like i'd say i almost always get these three products to use because it's just what i personally utilize the most when i am using cbd oil or cbd products which is pretty much every single day and i wanted to share this company with you specifically because it is one of my favorites um joy organics is a company that offers cbd products more specifically broad spectrum cbd products so they are thc free you don't get high from cbd products especially and definitely broad spectrum because they do not contain any thc they go through so many third-party tests to ensure their quality their potency and that they are again a true broad spectrum product so i am going to show you these three things uh starting with the gummies because these are some of my favorite i've tried a lot of cbd products and these gummies that joy organics makes if not the best like one of my top two or three cbd gummies they are so good i have the strawberry lemonade flavor and i'm gonna show you guys what they look like there is sometimes cbd gummies will have like a weird kind of like a weird smell to them when you open them up these do not at all as you can see i've eaten quite a few of them i have to get more um but they smell just kind of like a candy and they look like this each one of these cbd gummies contains 10 milligrams of cbd per gummy i personally find that around two gummies helps me with them having like if i notice i'm a little stressed more than normal throughout the day i'll take a cbd gummy i always use a cbd product before bed about a half hour before bed because cbd for me helps me get to sleep so much faster than i normally do on my own i have always i think in my adult life had trouble getting to sleep and staying asleep i've always been a really light sleeper and my mind just races i think a lot of us women our mind races at night and i used to lay in the bed like literally for hours sometimes before i could fall asleep and cbd like literally when i take cbd which has been for like years now i'd say i'm not in bed any more than like a half hour before i'm asleep which is great for me because it used to be hours at a time and my husband hits the pillow and he's like out which is so annoying but now that i use my cbd it's way less annoying because i can get to sleep way quicker and it helps me not wake up throughout the night as often so i really like you utilizing cbd to help me sleep it's also really great for anyone who suffers from like chronic pain or inflammation um anxieties stresses anything like that i love cbd if i have a really like i did a really hard workout and i have just a little more sore muscles than normal i'll use the cbd either the capsules or the cbd oil um capsules i usually find myself taking if say i have a headache or you know my lower back is bothering me or something like that kind of in a situation where years and years and years and years ago i would take like an ibuprofen or an advil for which i don't take anymore i use the cbd capsules for things like that that really help me and again they're also really great at helping with stress anxiety things like that so the capsules are just like this so the capsules have 25 milligrams each um in each serving which i think is one yes so 25 milligrams of cbd oil in one capsule so a little bit more potent than one cbd gummy um and the capsules look like so so they're super small which is good and they're really easy to take for me i've never really had an issue some people do but that's why i like that they offer the gummies as well and then the oil which this flavor by the way the peppermint i think it's just well they call it tranquil mint but it's made with peppermint oil organic peppermint oil um which is another thing why i love joy organics the quality of their ingredients is so top-notch um this flavor is so so good i was a little worried because like when i think like mint i'm like oh i don't want to be like too overwhelming but the tranquil mint cbd oil from them is actually not overwhelming at all it's really nice it's not too too minty or pepperminty and you just fill up one dropper full i'm shaky because i just drank my coffee but and there's 45 milligrams so again another like little bump up of potency from the other two products there's the 45 milligrams of cbd in one dropper full so that is like a serving these are nice because you can kind of like control like say you just wanted half of that right you want 22 ish milligrams of cbd you could just take a half a dropper and i drop it under my tongue and i leave it there i let it sit there i don't swallow it or anything for like at least a minute sometimes i try to make it go a little longer and then after the minute i if there's any left like we'll swallow drink a little water and that's how i use the cbd oil they also make cbd um rubs so like salves and things that you can use on your skin if you suffer from like certain areas that like for example my dad has a bad shoulder so he'll use cbd the cbd balm on his shoulder and it really really helps him with his relief so like bad knees things like that um anyone i think could benefit from a cbd product again joy organics is a broad spectrum cbd so there is no thc you don't have to worry about like failing a drug test or anything like that there's absolutely no thc in their products and they again do testing to ensure that but they also include like on each and every one of their products that it is thc free so i don't when i take a cbd if you haven't taken cbd before i don't feel like my state of mind is altered at all i honestly just feel like relaxed if that makes sense like it's not like something that i can like feel it's kind of something that's like an afterthought if that makes sense um so it doesn't like make you feel like altered or like your mind is altered or any way there's it's obviously like the non like they don't have like the psychotic like effects that thc does because that is a part of hemp that causes that which is not included in cbd if it was i wouldn't take it um so the broad spectrum products from joy organics is great they are a family um founded company and i really love their story if you have a chance go ahead on their website and check out their story and what else do i want to tell you guys about oh so they grow their own cbd plants here in the usa which i think is really important when i look for a cbd product all of their products are grown and made in colorado which is awesome their quality is great and oh so i also wanted to mention jewelry organics because i know a lot of people have questions about cbd products and like what's right for them or what is cbd they have so many great resources on their website that really help the consumer to like know okay what is it exactly that i'm buying what is it that i need do i need this so they have really great resources but i also wrote up an article if you guys want to check it out i put the description in or i put the link in the description of this video so it'll be helpful to you guys to check that out i again just wanted to show you these products really quickly and hopefully this was helpful if you guys are in the market for any cbd products broad spectrum specifically joy organics is honestly the best in my opinion so that's why i wanted to share it with you guys i use this stuff every day in my own life i wouldn't share it with you if it wasn't something that i used so if you have any questions for me about joy organics go ahead and leave them in the comments or you can go ahead and look at the article i include like pricing pros and cons and everything in that article that i wrote about the joy organics brand and that will be helpful for you as well but thanks for tuning in i will see you guys in the next video [Music] bye you", "t2Pd-13M20g": "- I'm cosplaying as a gummy bear! (beep) (classical music) All right friends, Halloween is just around the corner and I have some issues with Halloween. First and foremost, a lot of gummy candies, which is like my favorite thing, are not vegan! I still think it's weird that strangers are giving out candy to children. So, (laughs) I wanted to see if I could make my own vegan version of gummy bears at home. Flip It is a series on my\nchannel where I take one thing, and make it into the vegan thing. So I'm going to take gummy bears today, substitute out the gelatin, which is not vegan, and substitute in agar agar, which is. (claps) So let's see if we\ncan make vegan gummy bears. (whirring) (pouring) (mellow electronic music) All right, what is agar agar you may ask? It is a seaweed or an algae. It has a little bit of a taste, but not much, it's very mild. But it acts the same way\ngelatin does, almost 100%. The only real difference is that it doesn't quite get as hard\nas traditional gummy bears, which is fine, they're just gummies that\nare a little bit softer. We are going to naturally sweeten them and also naturally color them. We're going to make a blue-purple color, we're going to make an\norange flavor and color, and we're going to make green ones. And I'm going to use\nspinach to turn it green. I'm going to use an\norange to make it orange; and taste like orange. And I'm going to use\nblueberries to make them purple. If you guys are new here, I'm Candace the Edgy Veg, and you should hit that subscribe button 'cause I make new videos every single Tuesdays and Thursdays. And if you like this series, give this video a big thumbs up 'cause you know it's gonna rock! Also appropriate that this\nis my Halloween video, that I have a new hair color. Oh, if you guys want to know where to get these\nlittle gummy bear molds, and then I not only have gummy bear molds, but also little bears and little robots and little dinosaurs. I'll leave a link to the\nAmazon thing that I used, just in the description box. Well, this comes with a dropper. All right, to make these\nas super, super simple, depending on the flavor\ncombinations that you want, and the color combinations that you want, really the possibilities are endless. What I like to use is just apple juice. It has a pretty neutral flavor. But you can use any sort of\njuice that's your favorite to achieve different flavors. Another think that I am going to do is just color them naturally as well, by blending different ingredients to get the color that I want. So if you want like red, you can use beets. If you want purple, you can use blueberries. So all I'm going to do is\ntake the apple juice... You could also do this if you want cocktail gummy bears. You can do this with wine as well. I've done ros\u00e9 ones, they're so good. But you just wanna blend whatever\nyou're using for the color together with your liquid. So whether it's water, whether it's apple juice, orange juice, wine, blend that together in a blender and add it to a small sauce pan. Bring that liquid to a simmer and add in your agar agar and give it a good whisk. Now you can taste it here\nto see if it's sweet enough. If you want to add extra sweetness, add some agave in there\nuntil it's dissolved. This will also make it\na little bit chewier, making it closer to the texture\nof traditional gummy bears. I find between maple syrup, agave, and regular sugar, the regular sugar sets the most naturally. It does get a little bit chewier than the agave or the maple syrup. I opted out of maple syrup just because you're always\ngoing to have that maple taste. Sugar and agave are a bit more neutral. All right, so I brought these to a simmer and then let them simmer\nwhile stirring constantly for about three minutes. And now I'm going to take\nmy little eye dropper and fill in my bears, my gummy bears. These are like little piggies. I thought they were\npiggies when I bought them, but they're little panda bears, gummy bears and robots. So the green is looking a\nlittle darker than I would like. I would prefer it to be more vibrant. I think you could probably mix in a little bit of spirulina but I just picked something that was more neutral like spinach, spirulina does have a taste. But the cooking and oxidization\ndefinitely made it brown. So I'm just going to take my dropper and then fill in the little molds. (mellow electronic music) All right, so I'm sticking\nthem into the fridge. I popped up a couple just to test them. I have some here, some up here. My freezer's pretty full, so I also stuck some in the fridge, but I'm going to let them set. Now a lot of websites\nsay just 10-15 minutes. I'm gonna leave it for a\ncouple hours and come back. (classical music) All right, I've popped\na couple of them out. Look at that little guy. A little teddy bear. I mean obviously this\nis a tiny little mold, but you can get bigger ones. Like I said before, the texture is different\nthan a gummy bear, it doesn't have that\nsqueaky gummy chewiness, it's a little bit softer. But they're really tasty. I was thinking, if you wanted to do sour versions, you could probably add\nsome Vitamin C powder or citric acid powder, which is just Vitamin C, and then you get that tang.

explore taking CBD and effects if any on diabetes please be sure to subscribe below to get updates and news on CBD cannabidiol CBD oil has been one of the most popular items to hit the Wellness seen in the last year emerging research has suggested potential therapeutic benefits of the CBD compound and while promising it is still an area that needs more research and clarification here are the top 4 things to know about CBD oil one is CBD oil marijuana CBD oil is not marijuana cannabis as a plant that contains over 80 chemical compounds the two most well-known are Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol THC and CBD CBD is the non psychoactive compound meaning it does not produce the feeling of a high or intoxication derived from the cannabis sativa or hemp plant CBD oil derived from industrial hemp plants by definition contains no more than 0.3% THC this differs from the cannabis indica or marijuana plant which typically contains higher levels of THC the psychoactive compound along with CBD to is CBD oil legal yes CBD oil extracted from industrial hemp plants is legal the passage of the 2018 farm bill removed him defined as cannabis with less than 0.3 percent THC from the schedule 1 controlled substance list meaning it is now an ordinary agricultural commodity the 2018 farm bill did uphold the Food and Drug Administration's authority to regulate cannabis and cannabis derived products meaning it is subject to FDA regulations 3 what are the benefits of CBD oil for diabetes current research is examining the potential therapeutic benefits of CBD and a few published studies have focused specifically on the areas of pediatric epilepsy irritable bowel disorders and pain relief there is still much research that needs to be done and consumers should be aware that there is a lot of misinformation and anecdotal claims of reported benefits online so finding reputable sources for information is important the FDA has approved one cannabis derived medication epidural acts as treatment for two forms of epilepsy as well as three cannabis related drug products for the treatment of anorexia associated with weight loss in people with AIDS other CBD products that are not one of the fda-approved medications cannot make claims about curing or treating disease for is there a direct link between improved diabetes management and the use of CBD currently there is not much evidence based research to suggest a benefit of CBD oil for diabetes management there have been a few diabetes related studies but most have been done in rodents and have not been replicated with human studies one human study on individuals with type 2 diabetes was published in 2016 in the journal diabetes care the study examined the potential impact of CBD as well as another cannabis compound th CV on HDL good cholesterol glycemic control and insulin sensitivity as well as other markers results showed that while CBD did improve levels of resistant which is associated with insulin resistance and increased levels of one of the incretin hormones it was not found to improve glycemic control or have any metabolic effects however the other compound examined THC v was found to reduce fasting plasma glucose levels and the study authors suggested this might warrant further research it is clear that more research is needed to examine if there might be any benefit for diabetes self-management we will continue to learn more about CBD as the depth of research expands in the meantime make sure to use reputable sources for information and consider talking

part is guys I did a video um maybe a couple years ago I'm not exactly sure when I posted it but it got like 11,000 views and I so appreciate you guys watching but also if you could hit subscribe and like that would just be amazing so today I'm gonna be doing the just CBD gummies I got a thousand milligrams of the Sharpe gummies and thus our hearts and these come around every February for Valentine's Day so it's kind of a fun little limited edition whatever so for those of you who are new to my channel welcome thank you guys for tuning in so in my other video I kind of I rewatched it and I felt like I wasn't as prepared as I could have been so CBD for those of you who don't know cannabidiol CBD is a naturally occurring compound found in the resin flower of cannabis a plant with a rich history as a medicine going back a thousands of years both CBD and THC have significant therapeutic attributes but unlike THC CBD does not make a person feel stoned or intoxicated so CBD is for anxiety cramps period cramps headaches sleep I take them to help me with my sleep because sometimes I have insomnia and its really effective for me some people asked in my previous video if these have melatonin in them they do not have melatonin so if you guys are wondering that that's one question that I can answer for you no melatonin however something that I had mentioned in my previous video I'm not too thrilled because some of them do have red dye number four so some of them have other things that aren't like for instance gummy sharks they have artificial flavors so I'm not a huge fan of that just because it's not good for you it's like whatever chemicals however if they're effective then I try to wave that off so these are made in the USA their THC free so if you guys are stoners these are not going to get you high okay these are not gonna get you high you're not going to be stoned and there everyone has a different reaction a lot of the people commented on my video that they do it for anxiety a lot of people also mention that they didn't feel anything and I guess just like weed which this is not everyone has a different reaction so maybe you need to take more but this is made with hemp obviously it's a plant and yeah they have to keep reading it breed or eating its THC free because then people are gonna be like oh oh my god I didn't get high screw you guys oh my god wow these gummy sharks are kind of demented looking hmmm alright so with these ones here I had a long day I just came back from San Francisco so I wanted to put this video up for you guys cuz I got an email saying it was delivered so for the thousand milligrams it says to take one two three gummies every six hours as needed so just because it's a thousand milligrams doesn't mean it's a higher content it just means each gummy divided that by a thousand and it looks like there's set it on here well now I ripped the packaging I think I think it said approximately 68 pieces no come anyway and these sour hearts I'm gonna try one of these two the gummy sharks tastes really good um like I said in my previous video there's a little bit of an aftertaste but it's nothing to you know get upset about should I do the white what the pink or the white and the ones I got before were not sour they were just regular so let's give it a go my boyfriend love disease she eats them as candy honey I still have sugar in them dairy free fat free gluten free msg free that's good so I really do like these two and um I'm happy with my purchase so I used a promo code I got 20% off um I don't really know how it popped up I essentially was on the website just CBD calm and then I clicked out and I was like a different browser and then it was like don't leave yeah and then here's a 20% off coupon code so um and it was like all these different numbers if it Oh actually I think it might have been just 20 don't tell anyone but maybe give that a try so they're not inexpensive but they do come from a marijuana plant and they extract the the CBD from there so these two together were 16 free shipping and that was after the 20% off so it was originally gonna be 75 it's not cheap but I like to invest in my mental health and it really helps me with sleep and anxiety so I recommend it and as usual I will leave the link below and I will also leave the link to my original video and I hope you guys like it and thank you so much for the support and the love and please subscribe to my channel I so appreciate the support and as usual I will see you guys next time", "2WDnAVidDiM": "[Music] our

Jennifer here with thrive yoga moms or thrive in store bringing you another quick review of funky arms watermelon gummies they're super delicious you get 10 milligrams per gummy there are five gummies in this package so 50 milligrams of CBD of CBD isolate you get the isolate in these gummies and actually funky farm says a super solid when you are on the funky Farms watermelon gummies page from their website you can scroll down a little further and actually see the certificate of analysis right there so that makes your life a little bit easier however but it does have a QR code for those of you that have full skin thing and then from the website you can actually type it into the search bar you can type the lot number which we will be 100% honest we couldn't find on our package yeah we're not exactly sure which one is the lot number so the QR code kind of kind of got us there and more importantly the product page showed us the product page so fifty two point eight milligrams of CBD and zero THC per package per package yeah the one thing that you will need to keep in mind is this funky farms doesn't like give you all of everything like all of their reports and I'm not sure if it's just because it's an isolate or if it's just the way that they are they do show you your certificate of analysis so you know you definitely get 50 milligrams inside the package or five companies with ten each but you don't know everything about the plant like some other companies might they show you the microbial reports and the residual solvent reports and things like that we don't get that with this one so this product of ID's sugar and corn syrup so you get about 20 calories per little gummy and the product is manufactured in a place where Trina's and soy is processed just for those of you that have allergies are aware it is $10 so it's pretty cheap it's like 10 bucks or two bucks a gummy to go around the gummy we're down to our last one and I mean I'd like to so you could share it maybe cuz 2 & 2 this was five so we need to share it marriage is Shari yeah you all know about that what's hers is hers and what's mine is hers yeah that's usually about the way it goes I don't give birth to two of your children so I deserve a half a gummy and my right ladies we love the funky forums guys enjoy the guys they do taste well and they don't leave a weird aftertaste which some of them do mm-hmm for two dollars a gummy that's not a bad rice that's kind of doughy market right oh yeah and it's if you're kind of new to supplementing with CBD these are a fun way to get into it do keep in mind though that you see that I had to stop to make sure he only took half do keep in mind that you get five of them and when you take your CBD by gummy it's gonna take a little bit longer to get into your system than you then it would say if you were taking a tincture or if you were smoking abate now it's my turn are you done chewing so that you can talk I might I might continue to talk so the other thing that I really like about the product is the fact that it is when I was like one with that sweet and also a little bit sour yep it is a little sour kick to it but it's not bad it tastes really well and like I said in video it doesn't have a weird aftertaste some of them do know that we took really good babe yeah they do taste really good I think I said that you said taste really well oh sorry for all those English people out there I apologize which one's right guys does it taste really good it tastes really well I'm pretty sure it tastes really good okay well never know well we'll have to wait for other people comment below to comment below and tell us oh yeah I can subscribe our channel if you want to do another now back to funky falling on the back there's three different flavors and they've got watermelon tropical fruit and great and this one is much like favorite flavored favorite that I have received we got a box of these from the company because they were wanting to know we would carry some of these particular gummies in the studio drive temp store and so I was very thankful that they sent it to us and we've loved it we've enjoyed it and the jury is not out anymore we know it I think I'm going to be starting to carry the watermelon I preferred the watermelon over the tropical to be honest I'm topical oh you better get over there because there's just a couple left no so we're taking that of course so I do have other funky Farms products we're going to review so definitely subscribe to our channel to stay up to date with all of the best and hopefully entertaining CBD reviews and you can find out there on YouTube see you soon", "kC0PG3GqVMo": "thank you too so today I'm going to show you guys how I do my any type of gummies any type of any type of salt cane the way I do this is no fail and it's really easy all you got to do is boil some water mix it really hard and you're good the main idea of my gummies and probably everybody else's but I use a little bit more just to be a little safer is a lot of gelatin so usually for a recipe for gummy bears and anything anything like that it usually calls for one box for tax which is fun you know that really will work if you made some gummies with one box of jell-o and four packs of it will work it's it's I'm not saying it's not gonna work but but now during a hot day or even just a little bit of moisture in the air your gummies are going to stick together and they're going to melt and you're gonna be pretty pissed off so take my advice and follow my recipe and I'm sure that your gummies are gonna hold up in your pocket you're gonna be able to go to work and go on with your day without any worry that something's gonna happen to basically the money you spent making these guns so let's get started so this is really simple like I said all you're gonna do is boil some water and that's it so we're gonna add 1 cup of water now that we had our water will crank go on so this isn't gonna take too long to get hot it's one cup of water so it's literally about two minutes it will probably be there so we got to think fast to move this so what we're gonna do is usually now you can do two full boxes of gelatin and that's only gonna make your gummies last longer they're gonna be a little harder a little more firm but they will last and that's the main idea but I usually like to do seven packs just because it's a perfect amount of like thickness in there so so now we're about to start boiling so I'm gonna add my gelatin sooo some cold water so it does AHS a little bit so when we actually do mix it doesn't get love you not sure if you guys know it's the Spanish shirt I'm wearing I believe design and he's out of Philadelphia PA and you guys like these shirt so I'm gonna be wearing check out his website I'll have a link down at the top lots of hats lots of shirts who's got lots of stuff ok so now that our gelatin is dissolved I'm gonna add our gelatin to the water after I have my gelatin I'm gonna have my gelatin pack then I'll add our additive and we're done so what's that era now it's at our gelatin give this a good a good old stir because you want to break up anything that's happened to not dissolve John says it's fish so this mix that we're making now I have three volts here this one box recipe should almost perfectly cover all three moles so now that our gelatin is combined and there's no more lumps now get out our gelatin so I'll do let's still line add your whole pack you really don't gotta rush this that's the best part about gummies and jello you don't it's not hard candy it's not like the minutes it's done you got the rush and it's gonna solidify on you if it does solidify you can just reheat it it's good again all right so now our jello has a gelatin and it's ready but does it have any good stuff so so it's outer additive and then we'll take the next step all right so now do you added your additive to this thing's ready to go you're ready to have a really fun day so the hard parts done we have it ready now the biggest problem is filling your molds I see people using turkey basters don't use surrogate of turkey basters think about when you suck it in just the two go over here you're gonna lose by the time you're done here you probably lost about seven to eight gummy bears worth of drop so don't use the turkey baster it's a mess and you're gonna lose stuff what I like to use is a squeeze bottle a squeeze bottle you can pour it in perfectly and boom boom boom boom no mess and no loss so let's do this so if you have a big squeeze bottle you can burp the bottle like that so when you tilt it it doesn't shoot out at somebody sitting across the room and you kind of control it a little bit better so you just go over each one how easy was that using a squeeze bottle way better than using a turkey bass boom all I got to do is wait for these is wait for these things are cool and I can be poppin these things all night long feelin really good so we'll check back in a couple of minutes when they're ready we'll see what they look like so we are all solidified see what we got the fact we used a lot of gelatin these things are gonna come out nice and hold your shape and it's gonna be nice so yeah boom just like you went to the store got some gummy bears this time they're gonna get you baked it'll look way cooler they won't melt in your pocket none of it okay go on your daily business don't worry about these but I just got these little molds I got from Michaels and they see more there's so many cool molds that you can do I really want to try the Lego molds you can build Legos with those things just so so cool but that was easy boil some water add your jello add your gelatin add your additive mix it up mold done I hope you guys can tell but I'm freaking freezing it's cold so what I like most about these is you know hard candies they're great when they take too long and you know sometimes you just want to eat some candy really fast and these are really good for it so you could be boom-boom-boom and be on your way instead of sitting there having to suck on some hard candy for a while these are these are great and you guys like what you solo today don't forget to check me out on instagram at the NJ chef don't forget to check me out on medical edibles calm every single week I'll put up some new recipes

subscribers thank you again for joining I'm so excited this channel is kind of weirdly taking on a life of its own it's it's really really exciting but a little overwhelming I'm not gonna lie it's kind of cool when there's like you know a couple thousand people seen it but now we're getting into some not large numbers for me um that I never expected and it's like what oh but it's super cool and thank you guys so much I couldn't do this obviously without you so today I know I've got another company recipes up there and I'm always working to refine and make things better so in this recipe this is good for regular gummy bears or regular gummy candies or the sweet and sour there's really only one difference in the change for that recipe whether you want to make regular or the sugar sugar-coated and so I wanted to go for that as well as a little bit a little bit of change in the method but any one of those recipes will work so kind of how I'm gonna how I would list it is the regular gummy bears that I put is more like a condensed jello realistically it's jell-o and gelatin and you harden it up that's condensed jello and then the other candy this the sour one with the the sugar-coated sour ones they're more like a real candy so I know also how the gummy that's more like a real candy versus just condensed gelatin and I will stop babbling on now and also I've got a recipe at the end there if you want to stay tuned on how to make inverted sugar which is a replacement for corn syrup so if Kourt lake corn syrup is difficult for you to get expensive just not available in your local grocery stores you can actually make your own at a fraction of the price and it's super easy to make however it is very very finicky but I go over all of that at the end there about the inverted sugar so I hope you stay tuned for that and and check that out and I think that's all I've got for us right now I'm gonna get in as I usually do get into my ingredients the utensils you're gonna need we'll put everything together and we'll get some candies made we're getting started what you want to do is to get a pot of either ice water or set up a pot of cold water and put it in your fridge or freezer about an hour before you want to start this very important you need the really cold water to start to stop the cooking process for the syrup so just get that set up ahead of time and now we'll get into your ingredients and the tools that you're going to need all right so I'm just gonna go over the ingredients now the ingredients for the gelatin side are exactly the same whether you want to do be regular or whether you want to do the sugar coated it's exactly the same the only difference is whether you're doing the sugar coated or the regular is in the candy syrup and the difference there is if you're doing sugar coated you're gonna use one cup of sugar actually I'll go over that when I get into the sugar part you never mind about that right now we'll start with the gelatin side so you're going to need a one box of jell-o three envelopes of gelatin or three tablespoons you are going to need a quarter cup of corn syrup or you can use what's called inverted syrup which is a substitution for corn syrup I have a video at the end of this to show you how to make your own inverted sugar which I use quite often which I'm actually using today I'm just showing you the bottle for what you've got what you need in the light corn syrup you will need a quarter cup of melted can of butter 1/2 teaspoon of gore gum a quarter cup of liquid now I tend to use the kool-aid jammers or the or the kool-aid waters they're great or the Hawaiian punches are great to use as well or you can just use water you're gonna want a half a cup of liquid again you can use your juice or your gelatin I'm sorry your juice or your water for the gelatin and for this you need it needs to be cold so for your gelatin it has to be very cold and for our jello portion we're actually going to boil that and the only other thing is if you want to add some additional color and additional flavor we can do that as well and I think Oh sorry and we also need a quarter tea store sorry a half a teaspoon of citric acid I apologize almost missed that our half teaspoon of citric acid that's everything that we're going to need for our gelatin side and now I'm just gonna when we start the syrup I'm going to go into the ingredients in that for the syrup side and then if previously I talked a little bit about clear gel for the regular gelatin gummies you can actually use this now for either one and again we're gonna do all the work on our gelatin side and add this in so with regards to the clear gel if you want to use it what you need to do beforehand is you take a cup of the clear gel and you mix it with a quarter cup of sugar and you keep that to a side mix it thoroughly so that the sugar and the starch are thoroughly mixed the reason for that the starch will clump if you do it on its own or doesn't have the sugar properly mixed these starts will clump up in your mixture so that is why we add the sugar then you are going to use two tablespoons for your gelatin for your gelatin mix now this is an option now what this does is it takes your candy to that next level that more professional candy like you get in the candy store so it's not as gelatin like it's more it's a little bit softer it's more of that gummy candy versus just like concentrated gelatin and I've been using this ever since I first since I tried it I used it in all my candy now it's I love it it's not that expensive you get a large container of it and it lasts quite a long time so if you do make candies more on a larger scale or on a professional level you might want to give that a try it's excellent it's a little pretty pain to work with but I'll go over all that adding that in so for the candy syrup you're going to need one cup of sugar okay laureate let me back up here if you are making the sugar-coated gummies you are gonna use one cup of sugar and a half a cup of corn syrup if you want to make regular gummies that are not sugar-coated you're going to switch that you're going to use one cup of corn syrup to a half a cup of sugar but it's to a half a cup of sugar so the recipe is exactly the same this is the only part that'll change regular gummies one cup of syrup to half a cup of sugar sugar-coated gummies one cup of sugar to half a cup of corn sort syrup and the water remains the same half a cup either way you go that's all you need for the candy syrup side temperature cooks to the exact same we're gonna cook it to 260 all right so the equipment that we are going to need is a double boiler you don't have one no problem just what I do use a metal bowl that fits into a pot you want to add water into the bottom to the pot you just don't want it to touch the bottom of the bowl you're gonna need a second pot for your syrup you would let you want to use a heavy bottom pot it works it's better for even the heat distribution for your syrup that way your syrup cooks evenly you don't have any hotter spots you're going to need a candy thermometer a hand blender a whisk a couple of spatulas and a strainer if you've got one handy and I think that's everything that we need for our equipment I usually end up finding something that Wow's that we need but this is generally the majority of the equipment that you're gonna need so next I'll get into the ingredients for putting our gelatin portion together and then we'll then we do the candy syrup and then we combine both of them alright so give me a moment to get everything together here and we'll get started all right so let's get started with our recipe so our very first step what we're gonna do is our quarter cup of liquid we're gonna heat up in the microwave for one minute we want that boiling then with our half a cup of cold liquid we're gonna bloom our gelatin so add that to a bowl and your gelatin you want to evenly spread it over your liquid and again water or the juice I'm actually using kool-aid jam or yes or sorry I'm using the kool-aid waters you know if you do use real juice with real fruit all you need to do is to add a mold inhibitor laureen's makes a makes one and that's what you need to use if you if you use anything with real fruit in it otherwise they will mold very quickly but if you use fruit jammers Hawaiian Punch they don't have anything real in the sugar content they don't go mouldy I literally have gummies that last for months I've never seen mold on them so with regards to your gelatin you want to sprinkle it evenly and then mix it up to make sure that there are no lumps and then you're gonna set it aside for five minutes to allow it to bloom and meanwhile I'm going to microwave this for one minute so you're gonna add your box of jell-o to the double boiler you're gonna set your temperature to low and we're just gonna wait for I'm just waiting for my liquid to boil all right so we're going to add our boiled liquid yeah it got very hot I'm gonna add that in and we're gonna stir that around let our gelatin let our jello get dissolved you might need to add a little bit more liquid to it if you find that it's not fully dissolving but it takes a few minutes anyway and you want to continue to scrape all the gelatin off the sides otherwise it will harden up and we're just gonna stir that and let our water get warm now it's really important with jell-o and gelatin is the heat jello and more gelatin sorry I apologize the our unflavored gelatin melts at just hot a hot water bath if it is too hot it breaks the gelatin and what will happen is your you'll notice it'll start to get very foamy if it starts foaming immediately remove your bowl from the heat and let it cool down you also may need to add about 1/2 a tbsp more of unflavored gelatin because you've kind of broken the the you broken the gelatin a bit so it may not be as sticky or it may not be sorry gel as well so you may I need to add in an additional half a tablespoon to compensate for that so I'm just gonna continue to stir this on the low heat until it is till it's pretty much fully melted until the sugars all fully melted so now that my gelatin is pretty much melted we're gonna add in our quarter cup of corn syrup and get that thoroughly stirred in and we're also gonna add in our half a teaspoon of citric acid we're gonna let that all mix in and melt together again try and keep the sides of your bowl as clean as possible so now that our jello is all melted we're going to add in our gelatin and your gelatin is bloomed when it is nice and spongy if it is squishy at all then either your gelatin is it's not strong enough because gelatinous do have different strengths or it's old and the gelatin is just broken so you want it to be nice and firm and just break it up into pieces and scoop it in and then we're just gonna stir that until that's melted and again remember you just want to warm hot water by at this point you don't want the water underneath boiling at all otherwise your jello your gelatin will break and again if you see it starting to foam up at all take it off immediately now once your gelatin is all melted and everything looks nice like so we're gonna add in our can of butter so you know it in a quarter to a third of a cup of can of butter I'm doing a quarter cup they have dogs and cats behind me [Music] cats trying to trip me up here and then I'd in the Gerber gun this is when you want to use the strainer throw it on there and you want to evenly sprinkle it all over the top and now we're going to get our handy dandy hand blender and so you're going to blend this until it is completely all one color one unit alt one texture and that you're not seeing any kind of oil separation [Music] all right so we've got that all what we called emulsifies so what Gord got gorg um is an emulsifier what an emulsifier does is it allows oil and water to come together essentially it creates a little bubble so when we use the blender it breaks the oil particles up into tiny little part into little pieces and the emulsifier acts as a bubble and holds the water and the oil together in little bubbles that's how it all comes together and your water and oil live happily together otherwise your butter is going to separate and come to the top if you don't use that now a lot of people have asked me if you can use zanza zantac xanthan gum no you cannot it is not an emulsifier it is only a thickening agent so geurim is an emulsifier it is also a thickening agent and a stabilizer that is the other you can use lecithin I prefer Gore gum because lecithin gives it a flavor that I really don't like and I find that the Gore gum works awesome with you don't need the lesser than now at this point if you want you can add in your some additional flavoring I add in about a cup and a half full and if you want to add in some additional color I do it on this side as well I use the no taste red if I'm doing red color so I'm doing raspberries so I use the no taste red reason for that a red die has red food coloring I mean has a tends to have a bitter flavor to it so I like the no taste rent the only downfall about it is you don't get quite as an intense red as the regular ones but I would for rather give up a little bit of the color for than the flavor so I'm gonna mix that in and I'm gonna use the hand blender again just to get it full all mixed together the color comes out much nicer when you use the hand blender [Music] and when you're riding a clear gel you're gonna want to have your whisk ready and coupes and we're going to add in a tablespoon at a time and you want to evenly spread it over the top like so and then use this too and then you're gonna have to whisk it for about a minute or minute or two you're gonna notice it start to thicken up it's just kinda like cornstarch you know when you're making gravy you have to keep mixing it a little while for it to up for it to thicken up and do its thing we're gonna do and you can see how it's starting to thicken up and now we're gonna add in the second tablespoon same thing evenly over the top whisk and you're gonna repeat the same thing we're going to whisk it for about a minute or two until it's all to look pick it up so you can see how it's thickening up here I said you want to continue whisking for about two minutes and it should look nice and smooth and again all one uniform texture and color alright that side is ready is finished now we're gonna do the candy syrup side alright so for our candy syrup side because I am doing sugar or sour coated ones I am going to be using one cup of sugar half a cup of corn syrup and a cup of water now remember if you want to make regular gummies our only difference is you're gonna use a cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of regular sugar that is the only difference there you're gonna mix that together until it's up until it comes up together and your sugar begins to dissolve make sure to go all around the edges because the sugar likes to hide on the edges all right so and once your gonna have that all mixed up you're gonna turn your heat on to medium medium-high and you're going to continue to stir this until it begins to boil once it begins to boil you're not going to stir it all right the other one of the things I forgot is you want a pastry brush or a paintbrush clean paint brush so that you can clean off the sides of the pot to use a cup of hot hot water and that'll melt any sugar crystals that you've got and you want to get those off the side because any sugar crystals can cause your syrup to crystallize later on and just continue to stir it until it begins to boil Oh once your syrup begins to boil stop stirring and you're going to add in your candy thermometer and we are gonna cook this until 260 now if you want a firmer candy you can cook it to about 280 so anywhere between 260 280 you can experiment on your firmness if you want a softer candy cook it to 250 but I found 260 seemed to be a really good temperature for it and we're just gonna let that go until we hit the proper temperature now you also want to get your pot of cold water handy and the only thing that you'll do drink the cooking process is if you do see any sugar crystals form just wash them down and now while your candy while the candy syrup is cooking you just want to consider this because stir your jello side because the top part of its gonna start to solidify and the bottom is gonna be liquid because it's closer to the heat so you want to continue sure to mix that up and it all stays nice and smooth and keep it on keep it on low temperature so you have the low hot water bath keeping it melted all right so I've hit 260 take your pot and submerse it in cold ice water turn off your heat and you want to wait until the temperature begins to come down on your thermometer then you're going to place it on the counter until the temperature hits 240 well once your temperature reaches 240 you can remove your candy thermometer and we are now going to add in our gelatin or our jello and our gelatin mixture right so now we're gonna get our jello we're going to get that added in and then you're gonna very carefully stir this until it is fully mixed together your sugar the sugar syrup and the gelatin come together but be very careful because this is very hot you're going to pull it from the bottom and again make sure to get the edges and then it's this is up to you it's an optional step I do I like to use the hand blender on it and the reason I like to use the hand blender is just to make sure that everything is all mixed and blended thoroughly together [Music] [Applause] well see you like that be careful I'm gonna clean up my little mess here and then we're gonna get lit gonna let this sit let some of the air bubbles come out of it we you can work them out by just gently stirring it let it sit and then just look gently stir it again we need this to cool down a bit so you can do that and I'm just gonna clean up a little all right so my mixture is cooled down a bit and I'm going to pour it into my to my bottles my squeeze bottles that was one of the things I forgot in the utensils or tools you need is your squeeze bottles or eyedroppers and I use these squeeze bottles they're by sugar sweet sugar bowel and they've got their nice because they've got the piping tips for them which makes it really nice and easy as well as they have a wide bottle and a wider thread if you use bottles that have too thin of a thread if your syrup is hot or really thick it'll pop the top right off if after you filled your bottles if you still have syrup left just keep it on the lowest temperature just so that we can that you it'll stay so melted there otherwise it will solidify all right so now we're gonna get ready to put this into our moulds all right and then when you're filling up your mold you just want to fill them up just a little over halfway you don't want to go all the way to the top because that way it makes a rough edge on them and it makes your candies not very nice so you just want to try to make them as clean it's also you want to try not to get any jello on the edges there and you're just gonna fill up all of your molds and then once you've got them all filled you're gonna put them into the refrigerator for a minimum of four to six hours I found its best overnight so if after four hours or so II go to try to take about there knock coming out just leave them for overnight usually that usually works if they're still not going to come out of the mold you can put them in the freezer it means that you've got too much syrup the gelatin isn't working too well what you can do is put them into the freezer get them out of the molds remount them at about a tablespoon of gelatin and recast them and then if you find that you take out your candies and they're far too gummy too sticky you can remount them and add a little bit of liquid to it means that it has more too much gelatin you can add up I probably say about two or three tablespoons of liquid to it remelt it and just recast them and this recipe makes about sixty candies if you use smaller molds and if you use those little tiny bear molds you're gonna get about at least a hundred to 150 all right so these candies I had in the fridge overnight and I made lemon yesterday so you can see now I did I have found that they do stay there are better if you leave them overnight then just leaving them for a few hours and they'll come out and you pop them right into your sugar sour mix now your sugar sour mix should be one cup of sugar to a half a teaspoon of citric acid don't use any more make sure to thoroughly mix it in and that'll make a nice sugar sour mix if you just want sugar just use sugar what I usually do is for the sweet ones I will use a cup of sugar to about a quarter teaspoon of citric acid just a little bit because it brings out the fruit flavors so you just mix them into your sugar shake off the excess and lay them on a a rack with parchment paper to dry overnight now these guys also dry a lot quicker and then the other recipe and just pop them out now if you find that they're getting too sticky like this you can put them back into the fridge sometimes they do the when you leave them out they get too warm so as they get a little bit too sticky so what I usually do is take out one mold at a time and do them and that's it you'll continue doing that until they're all are all coated and just lay them out on the rack to dry overnight and those are your sugar or your sugar sour coated candies your sugar soda yeah cannabutter gummy and I just want to go for also a couple of things with regards to molds when you get brand news if you get brand-new silicone molds what I recommend to do is to cut to season them so I use a spray the spray cooking spray I spray it on let them sit for 20 minutes and then rinse them in hot water I don't use soap on them again but I want to rinse off all the excess cooking spray and then that kick that that cures them which is nice I found that red silicone mold do not work well for some reason they're thicker and I can never get anything out of them so I tend to stay away from red silicone molds I found the blues Browns and that work great but red mm-hmm does not work Oh to make inverted sugar replacement for corn syrup you need two cups of white sugar one cup of water and a quarter cup or sorry a quarter teaspoon of citric acid you're gonna need a pastry brush or a clean paintbrush brand new one will be better in a glass of hot hot water we're going to need a pot you want your pot to be super clean there cannot be even a speck of dust or dirt in your pot because it will cause your syrup to crystallize now you want a spatula and your candy thermometer that's pretty much all you need so to get started we're gonna get started in just one moment all right so we are gonna combine we're gonna put in our sugar or 1 cup of water and our quarter teaspoon of citric acid and we're gonna stir that till the biggest sugar begins to dissolve and any sugar crystals that are on the side you want to make sure to wash down we'll do that in a minute and if I change you see anything in your sugar at all any dust or any little particles whatsoever make sure that they come out because I said anything at all in your sugar will cause it to crystallize and sometimes things happen you get little little dust or little pieces of stuff I said then wash down any sugar crystals off of the side and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high you want to make sure that your pot is always in the center of the burner so that you're getting proper even heat distribution not where your sugar is cooks prop evenly and so we're gonna continue to stir this until our syrup starts to boil the moment it begins to boil you're gonna stop stirring it stirring once it starts boiling will actually cause your syrup to crystallize and we need to avoid that at all costs so just continue stirring until it begins to boil and wash down and in between keep the washing down the sides of your pot for any sugar crystals whatsoever like literally one crystal will cause your your syrup to crystallize so although it's really easy to make it is very finicky when you're stirring it's also very important to take your spatula and go right around the edge of the pot the sugar likes to settle in on the edges so you want to make sure that nothing's sitting because otherwise if it sits to the bottom it will will stick and cause you problems so the reason why inverted sugar is so finicky and while any crib one single crystal or dust will cause it to crystallize because what we're making is a what's called a supersaturated solution so I don't know if you remember science class see that science stuff does come back to you if you you made saturated solutions and supersaturated solutions where you add a saturated solution is where you have water in salt you have us salt to its maximum saturation point in its water once you go one crystal beyond that it becomes what's called a supersaturated solution and that is what we're making here because we start out first of all with a saturated solution the two cups - 1 cup of water tea cups of sugar - 1 cup of water creates a super create a saturated solution by cooking off the water we are now gonna have more sugar content than your water which then creates your supersaturated solution there you go science for the day you've learned your something new you're done oh sorry one thing I did forget is you're going to need the lid for your pot mine as you can see this one is too big for it if you don't have the right lid no big deal just use them flipped over they work just as good so you definitely need the lid to your pot because once we stop cooking this we're gonna put the lid on it immediately now as soon as it starts to boiling you're gonna stop stirring it you're not going to stir it anymore from this point on you're going to add your candy thermometer and we are gonna cook the syrup to 230 for between 234 and 237 if you want a little bit of a looser syrup then 234 if you want it a little bit thicker than 237 but you're not gonna go beyond that and the only thing now that we're gonna do through the cooking process is wash down the sides of any sugar crystals form that it's the only thing you want to make sure that's equal that's it that we're going to do through the process so keep an eye on the thermometer goes fairly quickly don't walk away don't go be hitting the bong or anything silly like that and as I said as soon as it hits 234 you're gonna wash down any crystals that may be on the sides and then we remove it immediately from the heat place the lid on it and put it on your counter or a stone block and you're not going to touch it again until it's room temperature it is very important that it doesn't get agitated or moved in its cooling process because any agitation again can cause it to crystallize now if your sugar does start to crystallize at any point not a big not a huge deal put it on low heat re melted and it should be fine so as it's boiling while it's boiling into all the sugar melts the crystals can splash up onto the side so said just keep a very close eye and if you've got which imma call it screws here normally there's little bolts here on your pot where the handle make sure to clean around there because the sugar likes to hide in on those and the sugar also will gather behind the thermometer but I only tend to move that one time near the end of the cooking process because as I said you don't want to be agitating your sugar at all so when my syrup gets close to to 29 to 30 is when I will gently move the candy thermometer and wash the crystals off in and behind mat and then gently move it back all right so my temperatures now at 234 I like to actually let mine go to about 237 I like it a little bit thicker so at about 236 I'm gonna pull it because your sugar does still tend to and continue to increase once you pull it off the heat so we're at 235 236 I'm going to remove the candy thermometer turn off my burner remit place it over on my back burner here cuz it's nice and cool wash off any crystals that may be there for the last time be very careful and then you're gonna place your lid on it and you're not going to touch the syrup again until it reaches room temperature as soon as it reaches room temperature you can use it you can either store it on your counter or you can put it in the fridge for up to six months and the one thing is you can transfer it to another container however any time I've ever done that I have it ended up crystallizing I guess the agitation of moving it from one container to another so I just tend to leave it in the pot that I cook it in so I always recommend if you're gonna do that use a pot that it's not your favorite so that if your it's off to the side for a couple of months you're not gonna miss it so I basically designate one pot for my syrup so I'm not gonna miss that pot if I'm if I need it for in the next couple of months and that's it for inverted sugar making your own corn syrup so this said this is I use it quite often in place of my corn syrup it's great if you do not have access to a corn syrup easily or like places in the UK that you really don't have corn syrup you've got I think it's called a golden syrup I'm not sure but now you can easily make your own well I hope you enjoyed that little tutorial there on how to do your own inverted sugar thank you very much for watching you have a great so that's my little tutorial there on a regular gummies and sugar sour coated gummies I hope you enjoyed that as always if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to put them in the comments I'll get back to you as soon as they can I do apologize I do sometimes have a bit of a delay there I don't mean to but some life takes over sometimes but I do try to get back to everybody as I can and then here's our little of my little lemon and I did lemonade and or sorry kind of turned out like lemonade so there lemon and raspberry and these are there were little little puppies aren't they cute well good luck with your candy making and I'd love to hear how your how yours turned out and if you have any questions about the inverted sugar let me know and I hope you have an awesome rest of your day thank you so much for watching and if you're new here and you like the video I really do hope you

here at the middle of fix a Belmont today I just wanted to quickly go over a product that we've had for about a month now but I've been using them personally and I just want to kind of give my personal opinion on the on then I don't think I've ever made a video specifically on this product I know I talked about the funky Farms display if CBD display we have next to the register up there but I want to talk about specifically the CBD gummies from funky farms they're really good so there's three flavors that we carry you have the tropical tropical fruit flavor you have watermelon and you have grape they are 50 milligrams there's five in them so there are 10 milligrams apiece one gummy is a serving size so honestly they can last you a good while you know uptaken last you five days if you only take one a day they are really good I like all the flavors I've tried I've been doing one of each for since pretty much since we got them but honestly I say watermelons problem my favorite great is gonna be a close second I can't quite figure out which one I like best but I do believe I like the watermelon a little bit more than the grape and tropical fruits pretty good as well I still do tropical fruit but out of the three it's probably my least favorite out of them too the other the other two rather say but yeah so there are five in these there are none in the $9.99 apiece per per 5-pack I mean it's not up not per one you know um but yeah they're really good they are surprisingly tasty you know you try to get these some of these gummies and you know you just taste too much of the CBD and stuff but with these you don't get a lot of that you get all the CBD you need for them but the flavor is still there and it's still delicious funky farms makes great stuff anyway I'm sure you guys have tried some funky farms cartridges and stuff like that but all-in-all I definitely recommend them great price for what you're getting five gummies for ten dollars you can't really beat that especially when we have like weekend sales for CBD you can even get them even cheaper you know depending the weekend sellers that Tom for CBD but that's all for today guys don't forget like I'm scrub swing by pick you up some CBD funky farm two gummies and we'll see you when you get here peace", "klEJ9_U_zRk": "[Music] hey guys it's Jen from holistic essentials I got another great product review for you today today we're going to be talking about another product from a company that we love called infinite CBD based out in Colorado they work primarily with isolate CBD isolate products and today we're going to be reviewing their gummies CBD isolate gin\u00e9s these gummies have 25 milligrams of CBD isolate each and there's 10 gummies in a pack and they are a hundred percent vegan a lot of people like that so they recently updated their packaging their package before was widthwise probably about half this and then you know it's like taking you took that other half and put it behind so it was you know not this thin is you know about twice as thick half is wide and the gummies you still got 10 gummies in there but the gummies were packaged in a ziploc basically a little ziplock plastic baggie that was put down into the box most people in care it kind of bothered me a little bit though as a retailer because of the fact that those gummies kind of stick together so if you had to you when you put your fingers in there to take out a gummy you kind of had to pluck it off the other ones it kind of stuck together a little bit like I said most people didn't care it did bother me a little bit but I'm really excited about this new packaging because I think it's great they did a great job and I'm going to open it up so that you can take a look and see how they look opens up really easy really nice you look and see what we've got here we've actually got a couple of trays we've got a couple of trays in here so if we go ahead and we slide these trays out you can see we've got two trays and we've got five gummies in each tray okay - - the one that I gave to my husband last week so but you will get an assortment there's no guarantee you can't order like all lemon or all lime or whatever it is they it's assorted flavors and they've basically got orange and then a watermelon and a lemon flavor and then they've also got a lime flavor like a blue raspberry and a grape so it's really nice the like I said the gummies aren't in trays so they're not sticking to each other the plastic you know on the tray just kind of pops off you might have a gummy that sticks to the top of the tray like that but so what that's not that's not as big of a deal but if they're easy to get to they don't get squished they don't get crushed I'm guessing that they got some feedback on that and it's a really nice portable way that you can take your CBD with you if you're a traveler I travel all the time out of state so I know that I can have this in my you know my laptop case in my carry-on in my purse in my suitcase and it's not gonna get it's not gonna get nabbed because you know it's looks like candy so they're just gonna leave that alone so that's no big deal but one of the things I wanted to talk about were again the 25 milligrams each so a lot of times I see on you know some other edibles that are out there very low amount of actual CBD in a given purpose gummy for example you know you might have a gummy that's got five milligrams of CBD or a gummy that's got seven milligrams of CBD and that may work for a lot of people but you know there's a lot of people out there that are you know taking products like this for you know things like chronic pain and chronic anxiety and you know having a dose like that a lower dose like that isn't helping them all that much especially since it's going through their digestive tract so a lot of product could be getting filtered out through kidneys and liver and and whatnot so I love the fact that it's a nice accurate dose every single time the lab results are out there and available we can make them available to you if you're interested in them we carry these on our site this is one of our best sellers

Asperger syndrome\nADHD OCD and dyslexia I make weekly videos on autism and mental health so\nfor new around here I'm wanna learn more remember to hit that subscribe button so\nyou don't miss out on any video also make sure you hit that notification bell\nso you get notified every single time I upload a video so I took these CBD\ngummies for five days and yeah that I had a rather interesting result let's\nget into it hey what's up welcome back to The Aspie \nWorld I'm down for all of you guys who don't know me I love to read comments I\nread and reply to every single comment you guys make so if you have tried CBD\ngummies before if you try CBD products before or know anything about this\nsubject I'd love to know please put it in a comment in the comment section\nbelow and give me a cheeky follow on Instagram so in this video we're gonna\nbe covering what is CBD what is CBD used for why make CBD into gummies how\nmuch CBD are actually in these gummies we're gonna look at the smell taste and\ntexture of these specific ones I'm reviewing today also I'll be assessing\nwhat effect they had on me do I prefer them to like CBD oils and how can you\nget your hands on some of these okay so this is the main event this is the CBD\ngummies they are a greenish grape flavoured gummy which is comes in a\npack of 60 but you take one a day so you got roughly about two months in this\nspecific pack I found them very very interesting the box is awesome I love\nthe color of these and I love the packaging I just love really neat I just\nlove really neat packaging look at this I just Oh God so good I love it okay so\nwhat is CBD? let's get into before we look at the details in the raw kind of\nurgh let's talk about CBD what is it so CBD is a cannabidoil  but it doesn't have\nthe psychoactivity that THC has coming from the marijuana plant so CBD is\nhigher in the indica  plant I hope I'm pronouncing this right part of the of\nthe cannabis plant because I think there's male and female cannabis plants\nso the indica don't which one it is but so indica is high in CBD so they use\nthe indica plant to take the CBD out which is how they\nmake things like these gummies and the oils and like creams and stuff like that\nand the cool thing about it is that it has no psychoactivity which is\nmore normally associated with cannabis and marijuana so this is why CBD is\nlegal in most countries it's legal here in the UK now it has been for a couple\nof years and I know it's legal in that most of the USA and part of you know\nEurope and things like that I'm not sure if it's legal everywhere in the world I\nknow that Australia are having an issue with it even CBD oils so I'm just kind\nof lucky that we live in a in a country where this is actually legally allowed\nso what is a CBD used for and that's a great question a lot of people use CBD\nfor things like aches and pains it's it's an anti-cancer supplement as well\nlook I don't know the science behind the specifics of it but they do use it a lot\nof people use it for you know like a cancer prevention thing just like eating\nhealthy and things I got like a food supplement it's also used a lot for\nthings like arthritis and fibromyalgia being on the autism spectrum I know that\nfibromyalgia is very common within females on the autism spectrum\nso CBD oils are used a lot there to help with that but one of the main things\nthat it's used for and one of the things I've used CBD for is anxiety now having\nAsperger's syndrome it comes with a whole host of crazy stuff and one of the\nthings is extremely exciting anxiety about kind of all kinds of crazy stuff I\nget anxiety social anxiety daily anxiety anxiety the postman poster through the\ndoor and that if people phone to me picture my phone thing like oh my\ngoodness you know like you know all this stuff really really freaks me out so I\ntake CBD to try and feel a little less anxious and more relaxed in my day and\nI've been using the CBD oil but I found that I have to take it as and when I'm\nfeeling anxious rather than a daily supplement because it tastes really\nnasty and the oil is kind of it's a bit it's a bit potent when you put it in\nyour mouth so that begs the question is why make it gummies now the reason\npeople made CBD gummies is because again the oil tastes a bit nasty and you've\ngot to take like a quite big dab on your tongue and you know the the oil tastes a\nbit rubbish the oil is very very expensive and this is\nnot fun you know you don't get there davon oil and tabacky or your throat and\nespecially say you're out and about you're traveling or you travel for work\nand you you're using as a pain relief you don't be like opening this like\npipette in the middle of the office meeting just like dabbing in some oil so\nI would say that the reason CVD always existed because it's a more convenient\nway to take it and like it doesn't like sweets or candy if you're American you\nknow like sweets are just great you know you just like punk hey I can give me\nanyway you've been laying in the park be like hey man what's going on I'm having\na great day in the pack sunshine and a feeling about anxious clunk let's take\none of these TVD gummies I'm feeling pretty fly and that to me is way worth\nit because before I knew that they made gummies I was always kind of like oh\nI'll try mix it in with tea so I used to drop the pipette in sysm tea and drink\nwith teas to get rid of the nasty taste and then I'd kind of like put it into\nall all kinds of stuff to put into food you know if you don't like a yogurt or\nsomething or smoothie but you know it wasn't as effective sticking and on the\nin orally directly into your mouth rather than mix it in with something\nelse but when the goes-- were released I thought what a great idea and the lovely\npeople are yummy nutrition actually sent me these to try I've worked on them\nbefore and I did a video on melatonin does melatonin help people with autism\nsleep I will leave a link for that up in the description above here so you guys\ncan check that out as well but this company is really really nice that these\nare all like this is a vegan product as well which I really really like and this\nis the product we are talking about today so these are the yummy nutrition recover\nand destress a CVD 16 gummies food supplement take one a day these are\ngreat flavor and it sounds you in a back here what it's got in it so it's got a\nbit of vitamin E vitamin C and the cannabis kind of at all which is a CBD\nhas 10 milligrams per serving one serving is one CBD gummy so let's let's\nget them or another look they smell phenomenal these things smell\namazing so this is well this is what they look like um these are just like\nthese the little green kind of gummy sweets you know there's nothing amazing\nabout the look of them I know a lot of people kind of make see me to gummy\nbears and gummi whatever but little gummies like these these things so these\nare really cool and a bit more grown-up as well you know you take it like a box\nof best weed still like your meeting again you look kind of a little bit\nchildish maybe I don't know but I just feel like this is way more like\nprofessional slick unlike grown-up and stuff like that they smell amazing the\ntexture it's really really gummy like this in capacitors just like a normal\nsweet that you'd buy like any other sweet the smell is really really great P\nand I really like it Anna yeah so it's really chewy it's full of\nflavor and this is something I noticed when I did the the video with the\nmelatonin gummies they were strawberry flavor and they absolutely tasted\nexactly like strawberry these are such a good flavor so this is the CBD gummy pack as you can\nsee there it's got all information on the front and then it has all the\nnutritional information on the back and you can also reach out to the company on\nsocial media they're really really cool and I tweet them all time on Instagram\nthem and stuff like that so please check them out on social media is all because\nthey're super super awesome if you're interested I did a video on the CBD oil\nfor Asperger's syndrome and autism and I'll leave that in a cat above as well\nif you want to go and check that out because it's obviously related to CBD\ngoes-- to the CBD oil so I thought you might actually want to check out ok so\nnow we've gone over the idea the ideologies the taste of smells the\ntextures the type of sweets these our type of comas these are\nwhat fact did they have on me so like i said i have been using CBD oil for about\na year and i used to take it daily but the taste was so nasty that i used to\ntake it like every other day and then obviously now i just take it as and when\ni'm feeling anxious and it takes a little while to get into your system and\nthen it you know it takes a while for it to kind of just kick in and it's it's\nannoying that i can't just take it in the morning but it's nice to have it\nthere as backup now i've been taking these i k told you\nthis is the fifth day taking these the CBD gummies and i gotta tell you that it\nis the best like relaxer I guess I've had ever so when you when you don't when\nI don't take the CBD I feel kind of like on edge a bit like I've tie in a bit\nworried and anything can trigger me at any one time but when I take the CBD\ngummies it kind of just chills me a little bit more than usual but it also\nmakes me not like stress out about the the smaller things that would really\ntake me off here in a day but like the small things that would take me off tuna\ntoday it doesn't trigger those things but something I will make you aware of\nit's not a cure for anxiety or a cure for being stressed what it does is it\ngets rid of most of it yeah so with autism there are gonna be things\nthat are going to trigger you and cause meltdowns but this will eliminate I\nthink I would say good 80 to 90 percent of it I have to tell you that these are\nthe best things I've ever seen I was so excited when I seen these\nsweets so I reached out to company and said hey look I'd love to do a video on\nthem and they were kind enough to send me this bottle of of them which is which\nis absolutely amazing and yeah I find that taking them in gummy Pharma is when\naccident taking of an oil former and so to me yeah the effects yeah it\ndefinitely helps was like aches and pains I still wake up with like really\nnumb hands and my my feet and hands ache a lot but now having the CBD gummies I\nactually haven't had those aches since taking them because I'm taking them\nduring the day every day and it's been like consistently not for five days so\nI'm feeling pretty awesome when I wake up and I'm feeling super more children\nlaughs and this make me a bit more productive with my work and things like\nthat I'm doing for YouTube so while the side effects of CBD\nthat aren't really any side effects and CVD a lot of people say that it can make\nyou a bit more drowsy bit more sleepy and I've experienced that with CVD but\nonly when I'm already feeling a bit tired during the day it's kind of like\nif you're feeling a bit tired and then you take like a sleepy tea or some more\nmilk you're gonna feel way more chilled and way more tired because it's making\nyou bit more sleepy so CBD is kind of like that if you're feeling really tired\nanyway and you take some CBD there's a potential like you could feel a little\nbit more sleepy I'm not like dangerously sleepy you're not gonna fall asleep in\nyour desk alright the wee little car but I'm just saying that like you know that\nit could be a side effect it's not really a side effect\nso do I prefer CBD gummies to CBD oil yes 100% and I think I'm going to get a\nsubscription with this company to actually have CVD gummies every two\nmonths get a bottle of these and just this is this is awesome I love it I\ncan't believe how good this is I just awesome so if you don't know where to\nget your hands on your very own tub of CBD gummies like this I will leave a\nlink in the description below so I will leave all the links for that in the\ndescription below so you can get your hands on these very CBD gummies if\nyou're really interested in it I'm pretty sure these guys ship worldwide\nbut don't hold me to it make sure you check out the website\nfirst and all the small print but yeah awesome I highly highly recommend these\nand I highly recommend the company they're a manchester-based UK company\nthat make fantastic supplements peace", "yJVRyHJLW3o": "[Music] you", "7nQ2KP0ZdZY": "[Music]", "cyBouHFm7SI": "busting the three most common myths about cbd gummy bears who'd have thought it gummy bears and cbd ending up not only being used together in the same sentence but actually in the same product it seems that there is little left in the world that we should be surprised about but before we get too cozy about the combination of cbd and gummy bears which all sound very innocent and sweet pun intended there are three myths surrounding them that we feel ought to be blown apart first of all cbd gummy bears do not contain the same amounts of cannabinoid some gummy bears have five milligrams of cbd in them while others have 15 milligrams now that's a huge difference in potential potency what is a good idea apart from reading the ingredient section on the bottle or packet very closely is to try and ascertain what strain of cannabis plant the cbd came from and if you can't do that at the very least try and find out how the cbd was extracted from it second cbd gummy bears do not offer fast relief contrary to what many say how do we know this well if you watched our video on cooking with cbd and the mistakes you can make there you'd understand why it only takes a few seconds to feel the effects when smoking cannabis because the cannabinoids in the cannabis enter the bloodstream almost instantly however when swallowed any form of cbd has to be ingested and then the cbd is absorbed into the bloodstream usually after a delay of approximately two hours now correct us if you think we're wrong but to us that isn't rapid thirdly and finally not all cbd gummies are safe to take the reason they are not safe isn't because of the cbd but more the case of where the cbd comes from now that cannabis can be legally grown and cbd oil can be used in certain products agriculture has begun to do what it knows best increase crops through heavy use of pesticides the problem is those pesticides tend to end up in the cbd oil that's then used to make gummy bears many pesticides are known to be carcinogens while others can have adverse effects on the body's organs if you want to take a gummy bear that is a bit safer then take one without any cbd in it though that isn't totally safe either as gummy bears are full of sugar and it is well known that too much sugar is bad for you the truth is virtually everything is bad for you if you take too much of it so use cbd gummy bears wisely and do your research and homework before you buy any we'd love to know if you've tried any we'd also love to hear your thoughts in the comments section below and of course if you enjoyed this video make sure to subscribe to our channel so you too can become a cannabis expert", "_qLXHN_lvhA": "quick video on how to make sour candy gummies you'll need one box of jell-o three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin which is about four bags 1/4 cup of corn syrup half a cup of melted infused coconut oil 1/2 a teaspoon of gore gum 1/4 cup of kool-aid any flavor and half a teaspoon of citric acid you also need a strainer that things spatulas molds and also a fan spray get a bowl of ice-cold water you need 1 cup of sugar 1/2 a cup of corn syrup and 1/2 a cup of water and this will be for later to make the gelatin you'll just need 1/2 a cup of water you will add in the 4 packets of gelatin so the full box [Music] make sure to stir everything thoroughly and then we'll just set it to the side until we need it later now you're gonna put your quarter cup of kool-aid or you can use water in the microwave for one minute [Music] now I'm going to get my jello and my kool-aid that I got out of microwave and pour it into a double boiler you're gonna stir until the jello dissolves on medium heat once it's all melted together then you're going to add your 1/4 cup of corn syrup again you're just gonna stir until it all mixes together you're then going to add in your half a teaspoon of citric acid and then mix that together until that dissolves [Music] now once the gelatin is squishy and firm you're going to add that into the mix [Music] you want to break it up into little pieces just so that way it dissolves a bit quicker stir until everything is melted and make sure the water from the double boiler is not boiling you do not want to burn the jello once everything is melted you're gonna put your half cup of infused coconut oil you want to mix that thoroughly now you're going to get your Gore gum and a strainer if your mix looks like this it's because everything is not mixed thoroughly so you'll want to get a whisk and now help everything just mix faster and more evenly now you're going to add in the gore gum and what the gore gum does is an emulsifier that allows the coconut oil and the water to mix evenly so you want to add that onto the top and then mix it until it all dissolves once that's done you're just gonna put the heat on low and then put it to the side while we work on the candy syrup side you'll need another pot you want to get a ziplock bag and a pan spray let's pray the Pam inside the bag and this is so that way the gummies the mixture does not get stuck inside the bag you also want to get your molds ready and also put some Pam spray on that as well turn on the stove to medium heat you're then going to add your one cup of sugar half a cup of corn syrup and your half a cup of water you're gonna want to mix this thoroughly until you see that the sugar has all dissolved [Music] now once you've seen that the sugar has dissolved you're gonna turn the medium up to medium-high then you're just gonna continue stirring until it starts boiling Wow that's boiling you want to make sure you stir your jell-o gelatin side periodically so it doesn't thicken as you can see it's starting to boil and you want to make sure again that you just scrape the sides of it so the sugar does not get stuck once the candy syrup starts boiling you want to make sure it reaches a temperature of 260 degrees now that has reached 260 degrees you're gonna take your pot turn off your stove and just immerse it into the cold water until it reaches 240 degrees once it's reached 240 degrees you want to place it onto a cold surface not onto the place that we were boiling on so that way you can cool down a bit and then you're gonna add in your jello mix into the candy syrup [Music] mix everything thoroughly until it's all one color and you see no bubbles let's sit for about five to 10 minutes until cool so that way you can pour them into the mold then grab your ziploc bag cut a hole in the bottom corner also grab a bowl and this will be so it's easier for you to pour in your jello mixture pour the jello mix inside the bag and then grab a spatula to get everything out I [Music] personally like this method better just because it's easier and less messy then you know refund refilling those syringe or squeeze bottles as you can see there's a little white in my jello mix that just means that I do not mix it long enough so it can be mixed evenly so again you want to make sure it's all one color no bubbles and you don't see any white in your jello mix just so that way you can get the best results these are still gonna taste good but just so that way you know you can get the best results for these gummies mix everything thoroughly a hundred percent [Music] now that I have everything in the molds we're gonna put this in the fridge for about an hour and a half after an hour and a half you will then be placing them in the freezer for about an hour an hour and a half again now for the sugar sour mix it's one cup of sugar and half a teaspoon of citric acid pour your sugar in the bowl then if you want them a little bit more sour then put a little bit more than the half teaspoon of citric acid and then you're just gonna mix it up until you have a nice even sugar sour mix once you try out the mix if it's not sour enough just add a little bit of citric acid at a time just so that way you don't get an overpowering sour taste get some parchment paper so we can place the gummies on now you want to get one tray of the modes at a time when you take them out the freezer so that way it can be an easier faster process taking them out and then sugarcoating them you can either do one at a time or you can do multiple I do multiple just because it's faster just make sure you place them separate from each other so that way they don't stick together and then all you do is shake it up and then you have a evenly coated gummy and then you'll just want to continue this with all of your gummies [Music] these molds I actually got from Amazon I searched up weed molds and as you can see they have these nice emojis on them the other ones have these weed leaf plants on them so they look pretty cool if you want to check them out I can link them down below in the description just so that way you can find them easier and you actually get a pack of six with a little syringe as well so it's a really really great deal so my phone actually died after this part is like cut I coated them I cut them up and as you can see there's nice little squares and I actually ran out of molds and I use an ice tray so I use these heart-shaped ice trays so if you don't have any candy molds you can use some ice trays just make sure you coat them with Pam's so that way they don't get stuck and it's easier to push out [Music] so now that I'm done coding everything this is the last part the hearts this is how they look up close they look delicious and they taste delicious too now I'm just going to be placing my gummies into my bags so with the emoji ones I put six in in a bag these square ones I put seven to eight in a bag and the heart one since they're bigger I put four in a bag and this is how they look so I'm gonna continue doing them with all the other ones and I'm just gonna fast forward [Music] now that I'm all done this is how they all look like in their banks and then I just store them in the freezer until they're ready to eat so I hope you guys enjoy this video if so give it a thumbs up let me know what you think in the comments and also subscribe to my

professional before use to keep out of reach of children because Johnson yeah I said that not recommended for pregnant and or breastfeeding papers recycled that's pretty cool and it's from Florida three three three one four so this is supposed to be a double dose it says I guess maybe a single dose first impression which is citrus kind of like hoping it's either orange or tropical fruit or cherry cuz any of the flavor I'm gonna be like so you know it's thinking about this when I had thought about making this video when I was making this video that there used to be this toad well can't say there used to be there still is but there's this tune did a few Lincoln's back somebody off camera wants to taste a piece so I'll make sure they get your piece so I'm gonna just one-legged tuned here I guess that little legacy fluently 9 milligrams just there used to be this toad you could pick up and lick the backhoe and it make you trip so I just I was really interesting that they made these like a little froggy you're supposed to chew alright we go Harper is uncompelled to chew intestine medicine in it like the cannabinoid tasted really good it tastes almost like there's chronic candy if you guys haven't seen her know what that is have some video a video some way back of chronic candy and it's lollipops this reminds me exactly of that when the of gummy yeah the medical taste is right there you know silk'n soldier it's very tasty it's very good very very good they're gonna say mr. chronic candy like if I was a kid you gave me one of those little ten milligram pops to like calm me down says under Alec bouncing off the balls I could give in watching like romper room or Sesame Street or something it gave me one of those I would eat it and come back to you for another one because the taste is so appealing I'm not truly but I am sort of mashing it up a little so I can taste it better but I'm soon swallowing geez no sure what my target mall grandma's you want to feel it I mean I personally think it's somewhere on 150 it says this is pretty strong it's a double dose and he was says it on the pack all right it's nice a little bit I'm just construction Wow the gummies are very stiff it's actually pretty soft kind of like the kind like a gummy bear though no taste the terpene I mean that's it tastes like just your finger doesn't surface okay so daily thing I ate it let's talk about what my perspectives the packaging is pretty cool I mean I like like the wanted to go with the arrow you're on to go um I like the I like the ideal that the amount of milligrams is really big like there's no guessing there's [ __ ] fifty milligrams hypnotist thing okay so there's no guessing Alec mmm you were back to the hole back to hole green and white thing clean background white letters white background or black um I'm scale one to five worst being one best being five I I give it a four and the flavor could have been a little stronger like as in like a fruity flavor of some sort um it was more medication flavor than fruit which I'm not opposed to that but in all honesty it was a little easier for me to not chew it because it wasn't really great tasting I mean it was difficult for me not to chew it because I kept being compelled to but it wasn't a lot better than flavor I probably wouldn't have held out I probably would have just cheated up so I know in that that that's a factor in the flavor and how I perceived the product [Music] does it work necessarily sure yet I mean I think I feel one of the fact that it tastes good and his package world", "ZsaaaUPTdnU":

bad just happened Jilla decided to go and take her little gummy slime and throw it on the roof so I had to jump on top of a chair jail had to jump I got my chair I had to put Jayla onto the roof so she could grab this slime thankfully we only have like I don't know ten-foot roofs at the lowest part so she's okay she's alive I'm alive we're all alive guys hi it could go H and I try to catch it but I didn't know where it went what do you think the gutter is it's in the roof girl yeah but the gutter and the roof are two separate things yeah that's true I find for you in smart well we are making our final slide it's gonna be the green slime are you ready Jay yeah over here I'm gonna put a disclaimer out there for everybody who wants to try doing this this stuff really sticks well the countertops and it really sticks fall to the floor see that we were gonna show you the final slime but you said I think we're gonna move on to cleaning up and doing all that good stuff so we'll see you guys soon look at this mess you see it you see it and now you're done Wow just like that the house is clean what do you think Enzo my pants are clean now and so are you happy about this huh these oh yeah okay about this yeah we have to put you guys in your beds you know why you would have eaten all the gummi bears all right well it's time for them to see the end results of the gummies here they are guys this one had too much cornstarch on it that's why it looks like you know all nasty still tastes good though this one's pretty good but it is firm like a rock cuz once they cool down they return to their gummy form and even a little bit harder because of the cornstarch this one's still a little bit warm I would say this is probably the best gummy that we made yeah tears here guys just suck on this one the one that got on the roof and you wouldn't want to eat it cuz it has little bits of shingle inside of it so nobody's gonna eat that one this one right here I got nothing to say

this video we'll be showing you how to make cannabis infused gummy bears there's just a few simple supplies that you will need [Music] the lead one ounce with unflavored gelatin 6 ounces of jell-o mace half a cup of water 1/3 cup of cannabis infused coconut oil and if you don't have this part ready a previous video shows you how to make it the link is in the description and lastly you'll need candy molds these can be purchased online eBay or Amazon to make the gummies first turn on the stove to medium heat then add your 1/3 cup of coconut allowing it to know once the oil is melted add in your 1/2 cup of water bring the water in oil to low boil stirring regularly next slowly whisk in the unflavored gelatin making sure it isn't even consistency then whisk in the jello mix doing the same thing once mixed only allowed to cook for seven or eight minutes on low to medium heat until does a nice rolling boil as you can see here my husband's great ear candy molds for that sticking and then using the droppers transfer the candy mix to the candy molds take your time during this process spreading an even amount in each mold after 90 minutes in the fridge you can use will then pop right out of molds [Music] two events ticking you can apply a light amount of sugar and that is how you make canvas infused gummy bears if you mind that they do look like regular candies so keep them away from children enjoy [Music]", "BvJGGEUKwnY": "hey guys welcome back to my channel so in today's video we're gonna be attempting to make some unfunny bears I got this little kit out of Cracker Barrel and I thought it would be pretty cool to try to make some gummy bears so if you guys are interested in watching this video let's get right to it okay so first thing first we have to unbox this it does come with instructions okay hopefully the lighting is okay here right they come with cherry blue raspberry unflavored gelatin I said okay guys so we have the little tray right here so cute and then we have a little dropper so that we can put off for a little chilly mix in there anyways so I show you guys a little tray right here so cute look at that okay we're gonna start reading the instructions I don't know what this is this is a cherry mix unflavored gelatin and then the blue raspberry I think I'm gonna do the blue raspberry ones just because that's on the ball like oh my try that okay let's let's get started okay since I'm doing a blue raspberry gummy bears you will need 1.8 L to do raspberry gummy mix point 15 ounce unflavored gelatin mix I don't even think I have the measurements let's try to get them okay so I found some measuring cups and obsessed to do 1.8 ounce of the see the blue raspberry gummy mix and this is 1/4 cup it which means is 59 meters or whatever that is and the 1.8 ounce I search on Google it's 53 millimeters so I'm gonna have to kind of wing it here so hopefully prank that it comes out this and if you hear like my dishwasher in the background sorry for that it takes like two hours to freakin watch dishes anyways okay let's see anyways let's just watch it's actually blue I'm dumb I thought it would just be like sugar yeah I don't know wondering I have to put 53 millimeters if this is 15 I'm winking at you guys okay I'm gonna leave it like that okay guys because it's not supposed to hold a little bit more a little bit okay the next thing on our list is to get point 15 ounce of unflavored gelatin it I'm really struggling you guys okay guys I think that the directions right I just need to put this in my array right here and there we have to get 15 I mean point 15 ounces but I'll flavor just mix okay I'll do it right okay guys I did my little calculation and I have to do 4 milliliters of the non flavored gelatin but I have a 5 right here so we're just gonna do 5 good okay we're just gonna do this one okay we're gonna add this into our little mix so far this is what it looks like let me see about the fence if I put you guys here the lighting kind of sucks like right here I will dark but whatever so next thing I have to do is put Oh to see two tablespoons wait wait I'm so confused it says combine a blue raspberry gummy mix point fifteen ounces of unflavored gelatin mix and two tablespoons plus two tablespoons water stir microwave on HIGH 30 seconds I'm comfy use okay we're just gonna put water okay guys I figured it out we're gonna do four of these five milliliter little teaspoons in use [Music] okay I'm gonna stir it because it says to stir and then microwave on HIGH for 30 seconds and then do it again use me use this we got a start okay guys I'm going to add some acidity in here because I'm trying to make some CD gun bears because that's - well you're right here I have the Kois 3000 a CBD natural whatever I'm gonna be like three droplets into this I'm stressed all the time and this helps me a lot gotta shake it shake it shake it okay we're gonna put three jumpers are actually round out another one I use which is a blue raspberry flavored ice gets out of new reg right hopefully oh my gosh it's gonna taste like weed okay we're gonna put 1 2 & 3 so that's about 9,000 that's nine thousand milligrams CBD into that so I'll chop I not do the math but if it gummy bear it's gonna have some type of CD in it cuz they're not chose one it like tastes like weed I guess I'm sure guys what it looks like before I'm microwaving so pretty much I'm just turning it everything ok I think I'm just gonna keep stirring okay guys let's go ahead and microwave this for 30 seconds and then we'll stir again because it says to soar again and then do 30 more seconds okay I sense I'm dumb and I don't know if I could put this in the microwave oh oh my gosh I like it I just don't wanna like chassis it might cat so I'm gonna put it in this cup right here beautiful cut and then we're gonna microwave it [Music] okay go ahead for 30 seconds and then we will be right back okay this is the first little round it looks already kind of get kind of get to eat I don't even know if I'm playing in focus let's go ahead and stir it again Steve microwave 30 seconds stir and then microwave again mr. branch side of tray very lightly with cooking spray so we're gonna get some cooking spray with you and that's that fine you guys got the cookie spray go ahead and put it except to put like a thin layer okay now we have agility then this smells like correct I shouldn't have put that CBD in there but oh well that's kind of kind of mess with the flavor go ahead and stir it okay next one we have to do let's see sprin set of train very lightly oops I did a lot fill bear shaped cavities with mix using dropper under feeling slightly so don't put it all the way refrigerate for 20 minutes it makes 50 gummy bears our guys I'm gonna have 50 cbdu gummy bitters all right let's go ahead and put all these little gummy bears in - dude it's scary you guys I feel like I should probably like No you're good you're good I was gonna say properly like rinse it somehow right they said to not fill it all the way oh my gosh oh my gosh you get a better angle because this ain't working all right let's get this close by let's do this scared [Music] okay guys I call the gummy bears filled up it's kind of messy but don't judge me on that you guys let's go ahead and put these in the fridge I need to be there for 20 minutes they're gonna be

it's like blueberry you couldn't you can barely taste the CBD right could taste it so I do the math and there's about 180 milligrams of CBD in each of these little gummy bears so I would have to eat like 20 to get like the effect of like being calm and not being so insight I like so much anxiety oh my gosh look at how cute the berries oh my gosh they don't gummy bear actually really good so I'm gonna say this is a success these gummy bears are delicious Oh what got one that has like a lot of that marijuana taste but overall they thanks beautifully they do taste like blue raspberry so it's
