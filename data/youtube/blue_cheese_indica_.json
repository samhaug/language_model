{"Pz6IvfGmjcc": "good morning and welcome starting over 420 bringing you guys another straight appreciation video now today we're gonna be talking about blue cheese yeah blue cheese for the cross between blue dream and UK cheese for the genetics it's really really fireman let me show you guys what it looks like up close rather blue cheese it's really far away I like the debate thing I like about this great is the actual blood structure it's a little bit better than a lot of the strains I might actually try them the buzz structure is more of a G then then a blue dream because I feel like blue dream is really ugly sometimes like blue dream can be like crumbly it gets too dry and [ __ ] but I mean the UK cheese complements that really well with the smell of course and it's damn-near like like exactly how it smells like it's exactly how it tastes like like really really like piney like almost like almost like just a [ __ ] nugget pine-sol bro like like when you smell it up close is real real real pungent listening to some Larry Jones shouts Larry June you know get the bottles right you know sipping on some coffee gotta have that in the morning but yeah without further ado hopefully you guys have got your ball oh the papers your lunch your edibles however you ingest your medicine go ahead and take a nice fat rip remove or if you got to be burned in a blunt or if you burn in a joint go ahead and take that nice bat drag whenever I ripped open Cheers [Music] main takeaway from Lucchese be immediately feel almost like a hitman like going around your eyes [Music] slowly but slowly dissipates throughout the body for a very very light body buzz and that's around around 30 seconds after ingestion overall bleu cheese if I had to rank it I'd probably give it like a like a hard 6.5 or a hard 7 it's pretty good but a great bud of a great buy but a little bit differently now just because like I've had really really fire strains and like I feel like they're really stepping up the game uncertain strange so like I've stepped up I taste levels you know like by a connoisseur type oh it stinks blue dream I mean blue cheese solid solid solid solid 645 solid 70 but I appreciate you all for watching this straight appreciation video please hit that like and subscribe button if you enjoyed the video follow me on Instagram and snapchat for more frequent updates but

gelato sc package 518 maybe not 5 18 20. i guess that was uh what yesterday it's been they packaged it to me okay anyway here we go we got the ooze battery right shout out to use life i love to use batteries i love everything oohs really i don't have any rigs or anything like that but maybe one day maybe one day i can get me a ooze rig i really don't care for like the silicone ooze rigs but all right here we go we're gonna get right into this guy here there's my first one oh i'm liking the look of it nice white tip um not much head space in it okay but the last card i got was that mk mk ultra and it looked like that where it had like that that cloudiness up top uh where it kind of looks like like it's rusting or something like that i don't know if you guys can see that or not let me uh let me try this real quick can y'all see the color what i'm saying with the with the color in it let's see like this maybe sorry if it's too damn bright i'm just trying to get you guys to see what the hell i'm seeing i don't know the headspace doesn't look too bad though i mean it's just a normal average bubble well let's uh let's get into it huh of course i always have my [ __ ] on the lowest setting the lowest setting on this used battery give it a dry pull here real quick nice and fruity like gelato supposed to be relaxed happy or fork uplifted creative uh amd i guess i don't know i've never seen this cartridge before a v d o c g never seen this cartridge before boys it's not a jupiter card obviously it's a 10 um a 510 thread huh it's definitely oil it's not that waxy stuff like the mk ultra so they're on nice and tight i got a lowest setting clicking on five times of course i always have my [ __ ] on green green means full battery let's go it's supposed to help but stress anxiety depression chronic pain insomnia peppery's citrus earthy are the top terpenes i tell you what it's got a nice uh a nice tickle and throat nice tickle on the nose what did i pay for this i think either 50 or 55 bucks it's a new company it definitely explained lungs it's not bad it's got a hell of a nice gelato taste to it [Music] the lookout is nice the cartridge seems to be like any other 510 thread cartridge so i just don't know what the amd stands for a-n-d or something i don't know if you guys can see it right there all right see it right there maybe somebody can tell me if if you guys seen that seen that one before but uh starting to feel like up up in the upper low area the head the forehead uh area the eyes i believe this is uh gelato is a uh indica dominant i know it's a hybrid but i believe i believe it's an innocent diamond so it's more of like the couch lock kind of buzz if you guys know no know what i'm talking about take another pull i'll tell you last two days of work has been really hard on my body man i like being off and then going back to work like that and having a big ass job to do so i definitely need some um some good medicine my hands my hands hurt so much um so with that said like i need some good medicine for my back and my hands and this seems to be working pretty damn good i'm gonna take another pull of this and i'm gonna show you guys what this g leaf uh looks like and and tell you a little something about it about the uh the blue cheese strainer cheers if you notice i don't do blinkers i don't heat it up i go straight in i mean not a bad card not a bad cartridge at all all right i'm gonna set that to the side turn the battery off i forget to do that look before i go to the other other g leaf fire one thing i do not like about these batteries is that when you're smoking them if you do not forget to turn the battery off and you go to stick in your pocket that battery can be pressed for a long time it can burn your [ __ ] out waste half your cartridge and make the rest of it taste like a burnt coil just it's disgusting so if you can get the inhale active batteries which normally i have my cresco on uh it's probably my pocket no it's not i don't know where the [ __ ] it is somewhere close but anyway uh the inhale is is the inhale active is what you want okay or just make sure you're you're you turn your [ __ ] battery off that way you're not wasting your cartridges when you're out and about because normally you just have them sitting down okay let's get into this flower let's get right into this flower here guys uh blue cheese blue cheese flower here's some numbers i'm not going to read the numbers off to you you guys can see it for yourself okay uk cheese times blueberry i might have done this before because that definitely sounds familiar uh the feeling is supposed to be relaxed happy or fork sleepy uplift it this is an indica as well uh stress uh it's good for stress chronic pain anxiety insomnia depression uh top terpene citrus peppery and herbal did you guys see the numbers i hope i don't have to read the numbers up to you you guys see the numbers right i'm being lazy on this one yes i am we're already 11 minutes into it i'm opening this up now when i was looking at this but i wasn't too pressed with this bud um just because it's like really stimmy and it wasn't trimmed like good at all check it i mean it's pretty bud don't get me wrong the bud is uh definitely pretty and purple and it's got some nice ass tricones on let's see if i turn this light on get any better view better light maybe not all right let's go up let's go up you guys see what i'm talking about with the with the trim job there's a lot of sugar leafs on it but you know what it's okay because i'm gonna be pressing this um before i put it in with the hydra stone it was just a little under 3.5 of a gram so um yeah you see the purple in that [ __ ] that might be a thumbnail right there boys hold on let's get it let's get a thumbnail real quick let's get ourselves a thumbnail real quick ladies and gentlemen all right let's get it all gonna get the epic right there 317 hell yeah all right got the thumbnail let's go let's uh get ourselves a little piece of this guy here and put it in the bong and give it a rip huh now i only had it hydra hydra in the hydro stone for maybe maybe an hour and a half two hours and this stuff was really dry and it's it's ready to be pressed already it's not even like crunch anymore yes it was really crunchy so uh i'm gonna take this little guy right here okay and we're gonna just put that whole little guy there in the bong and we're gonna rip ourselves some blue cheese i'm putting sugar leaves and all in it wow for a second though i thought that was a seed no seed i'm gonna talk about they don't have seeds here right that's only street oh see now every once in a while you find a seed up in it try not to finger bang the [ __ ] out i just dropped a nice piece right on my foot all right let's get it i got the wick right her i got the pick right here give it a flick right there oh the fan's on oh the fan is blowing it out how about that cheers wow and it definitely has a a uh i was weird i guess cheesy a kind of cheesy kind of i had my buddy brandon smell it last night and he he uh he said wow it has a really distinct smell of of something some kind of like in the kitchen and i was like yeah cheese i mean it was pretty cool how he kind of knew exactly something different about it you know what i mean this is a good strain man i do know it's good for paige because like the child one of the child straight is a cbd straight so anything anything with a little cbd in is good for the paint especially for those people who's looking to relieve the pain like myself that taste is just [ __ ] amazing man even out of a bong that's what's crazy about it like even out of the bone cherish boys all right man imma end it with that we're going 18

doing but they cannot do it I went to my city my gang rolling with me no time to stop we keep what's good YouTube it is your man the gadget God ganja vape you once again with a brand new video but my continued followers fans supporters and subscribers with that notification bill turned on y'all already knew that what's up everybody if you haven't noticed already trying out my air pause now to see how I can record with them me personally I would much prefer a line in mic but I'm just gonna try these out to see how they work so in addition to the train wreck I also got another thing from Julie and this one here is an indica sporting a TAC of eighty three point one percent a CBD of 0.2 percent CBN 0.2 THC V 0.8 percent and a CBG of 1.8% I'm of course talking about none other than blue cheese now it does not say the name on the front but it does have it on to the back blue jeans percentages you gotta getta but yeah just gonna dive right into it and just like the train wreck it comes in a little test tube this one smells just a little stronger than the train wreck even though it does sport higher percentages so that just only makes sense all right let's load it you do one more hit of the train wreck before we go over to the blue cheese Cheers see now that is just starting to taste like air it started I can taste the Terps a little bit but when I was first vaping it was just flour flour turb flour now it's just starting to taste like air air turf there yeah cheers everyone that's hitting like some cheese most definitely I could taste that Christian there most definitely that's what was hitting me so hard a little quick analysis oddly enough it tastes similar to the smartcard Blue Crush I've reviewed that on on a sham before you go back and see that but that was a even though that oil was cut this reminds me of that but this is in no way on the same level of that this by far exceeds but I mean the only thing at this point to do is just a G's sneaking up on me now only thing I can do now is give it a days of work they play and come back with my reviews but so far it's hard if you couldn't tell already the taste is pretty consistent tastes like not blueberry but what is that blue raspberry it's not a fruity taste but it tastes I'll kindly describe this it's almost like a vape oil that you would do in a regular of a pen but pure cannabis oil here I got to do the drip test now look it's a clean cut across between the silver piece and the oil got a little piece across and then you see you have your little piece connecting the two you see but the oil is not moving so yeah I'll be back with my day of plate and you'll have a good review hey y'all I'm back after a day with this vape I've got to say that pairing it with my train wreck it's just the perfect dayquil nyquil effect I was able to stay up with the train wreck but the blue cheese was whoa we knocking me down yeah it was it was a nice little trip I'm not gonna lie and I'm sorry if I just had some actual flour on top of that I would probably explode like a quasar in space or something but not to get sidetracked this is an amazing rate very good and like I said pairing you with trainwreck oh my god if I had to rate this pin here I would give it a that one really want to work its way out if I had to rate this pin here I would give it a now I have to see what's stopping it from getting a 10 there's nothing really I'm not sure down with the blue cheese or the mixture but it gave me a Sahara Desert through a very dry so yeah it hits hard it's hard has a good flavor and the real question this doesn't get you high it's an indica so it'll really get you real relaxed and chill so you won't really have that firing off in the brain that you would normally get from us us even still nevertheless a good weight to take with you wherever you go since it is a sativa you have to remember that you should not overdo it because you don't want to get slouchy and sluggish in public unless that's your thing not really mine maybe LA Confidential maybe LA Confidential or the wiki girl pre-roll I had from Liberty Health Science I got to go back and get another one to do a video on that but yeah those two pre-rolls might be actually amazing to pair with this bleu cheese but I don't want to take up too much more of your valuable time but I do want to thank you for stopping by and checking out this video on this blue cheese bake and if you have tried the blue cheese fade don't forget to drop a comment down below letting me know that you too have tried it and what are your thoughts on it how do you think it tasted what kind of feelings did you get from it don't be afraid all comments are welcome well that about wraps it up for me folks I give this a 10 I really do wish that we can get some bigger size vapes out there I mean if that's not the case then I'm just gonna have to buy my own cartridges and then buy the oil straight from the dispensaries and just start filling up my tubes I don't really have a problem with that it's just that that's a little time consuming and I would just more prefer we rather if by the by the cartridges kind of just cuts out that middle working up

raised cows handcrafted quality ingredients into the world's finest blue the story of rogue Creamery blue cheese starts here at our dairy contented cows enjoy some of the finest pasture in the country pasture grazing produces milk that is rich and supremely flavorful we partner with local dairy farms to produce certified sustainable milk that is the essential raw material winning cheese our cows are milked twice a day and that milk is delivered to our creamery early each morning when the milk enters the VAT we gently heat it just to the temperature at which it was milked preserving its complex natural flavor and maintaining its poor raw state next our cheese maker adds a starter culture which will add flavor and those distinctive blue veins several hours later cheese makers add rennet which transforms some liquid milk into a semi solid state similar to soft said jello and coagulation takes about 30 minutes the coagulated milk is cut by hand into smaller cubes using a cheese heart cutting creates our surface area allowing the way or liquid to Train away these solid curves after a brief rest curds and whey are stirred until they reach the desired firmness then the way is drained and curds are salted and stirred until the proper acidities reached our skilled team of cheese makers work together carefully and efficiently creating beautifully formed wheels over the next few hours wheels will be flipped by hand numerous times to provide even draining now the weight begins inside our historic temperature and humidity-controlled aging caves wheels are nurtured during their transformation young wheels are salted for flavor and rian development and hand turned daily creating the fine even texture after a week wheels are pierced this allows oxygen to enter the interior of the cheese over time the blue mole cultures added at the beginning of the cheese making process begin to flourish creating distinctive glue veiny and exceptional flavor all rogue Creamery cheese's are released only when aged perfection each day's production is tasted to determine what it meets our high standards for aroma appearance texture and flavor when cheeses are ready for release our packaging team takes over lovingly hand cutting wrapping and packaging it for the trip to your local cheese counter from the dairy to the final cut and wrap we're proud that our cheeses are

a doctor's and statement or anything and oh man it's just a bit it's an interesting concept and people smoke this in order to just simply be relaxed you can smoke a ton of it and not get high because it is less than 1% THC but it's got a lot of CBDs and that's what gives you just mellow swiss like this because you know life is kind of complicated and they've got shops like this right now and i am

you guys are looking at some of the blue cheese I just picked up some insanely fire stuff as you guys can see really triped out good amount of THC content in this [ __ ] I'm as far as I know the genetics on this stuff are blueberry crossed with I think the UK cheese something like that and then it's an indica dominant hybrid so it definitely put you to sleep if you don't pay attention it's got a nice couch lock effect to it as you guys can see the buds kind of have like a golden tinge to them it's like kind of like a light it's not it's like in the middle of light and dark green buds and then trichomes kind of give it a golden look to it and then the hairs or whatever got some nice light orange hairs the smell is insane um this is some really loud smoke it smells like straight-up it's like it has like a skunky cheesiness and then it has like [ __ ] blueberries it's [ __ ] has did one of the dankest funks I've come across on me one of the most pleasant [ __ ] smells on a bud that I've smoked you know I mean definitely some insane stuff I love the smell on the stuff um the taste is a lot more blueberry blueberry like than a smell you can't really taste much of the skunky nest but um it does have us like a slight cheesing after Tony yeah blew a smoke out you know I mean as you guys can see really [ __ ] tracked out some really dense buds as well show you guys here not too much gift you know not rock-hard but definitely a good density to it didn't pick up too much of this stuff was kind of low on money only picked up an eighth so I've got only a couple buds I'm showing you guys right now this is a really small bud house you guys couldn't see it's still [ __ ] dank his [ __ ] really frosty really nice look to it um unfortunately I'm not gonna bill to smoke any on this video the [ __ ] camera doesn't you know unfocus and it won't it'll be real blurry when I take the hit you won't be able to see the smoke so I'll put up a session you know pretty soon I'm not sure why but within a few days these two little nugs the nug and the right was a on the right the left was a full nug and the nug on the right I picked off of it and that's the inside that's all the cakiness and the inside and that's where it was so you guys get a tell the inside you know I mean really frosty insides kinda has like a banana yellow tinge to it as I said before overall some really [ __ ] fires [ __ ] I took a nice fast nap before and I'm really medicated I better play some Gears of War 3 so gonna kind of probably cut this video a little short give you guys a couple more little shots I'd probably write this stuff like a 9.5 the nug structure is kind of weird as you guys can see on this bud a little weird kind of almost like a Christmas tree just kind of funny because uh today is at 23rd it's kind of it's [ __ ] weird structured bud you know I mean like it grew out like this he's [ __ ] odd but he would think it'd be like the nug would look like this they would have this dumb down here but the stems up there it's what I was a some insanely fire but I'm not gonna let that stop me from smoking that no I mean but I could give you guys a little bit more of a try

this time I was able to get my hands on something a little special CBD cheese this is a high CBD strain weed I was told that if you smoke it still will give you you know it still has THC a decent amount of THC in it but yeah I decided to try it out CBD cheese looking for a minute to get a CBD strain I think maybe when I first got my card I had come across a CBD strain I cannot remember the name of it but I really enjoyed it I really do enjoy CBD as somebody who does suffer from anxiety I have found that CBD is a very good natural way to deal with I am one that doesn't want to get put on to you pharmaceuticals or be taking pills every single day I'd much rather smoke wheat you know and use I guess marijuana related products such as CBD to help me cope with it you know so yeah here we have what you already know I'm sure if you've been watching honey Dutch Dutch masters here Dutch gang pearl gang representing because you know we always purlins it up but yeah I definitely know that it's definitely a higher percentage than normal for sure well I can tell you the buds we're a decent size I'm gonna give the buzz to eight out of ten the smell is definitely an 8 out of 10 I like my bugs usually a little bit more dense than this is this is a little hairy but I'm not gonna complain because it does smell real good but yeah so all in all I'd have to say I give this an 8 out of 10 overall so yeah let's see how this lets roll this bad boy up see how it works see how smokes [Music] [Music] Perle gang baby you already know how we do so we got this CBD cheese rolled up nice dutch honey Dutch ready to get it going here we go CBD cheese pearl gang let's see how we got it let's see how it tastes let's see how it smokes Cheers so far so good pretty tasty pretty pretty pretty tasty actually I like it burns nice as you can see nice white ash right there very very nice I'm really um very tasty I just want to take a second also to just give a huge shout out to everybody out there

everybody thank you thank you thank you for followed a lot watch it hopefully these videos can help you out a little bit in your journey to discovering different medicines and hopefully some of these medicines will affect you in a positive way you know me personally that's why I always try different streams and excuse me that's why I always try different strains just to basically see how different strains react to my body see how you know how they make me feel you know some strings give you that body but some give you that pie right behind your eyes which is my personal favorite you know so don't be shy at all well I guess if you're smoking dad downtown Brown for sure but wrong as you can see also please head over to Instagram give me a quick follow it's at JB boy 3 1 3 Rd love to see you comment on the photos over there my Instagram is kind of a mixture of my life plus a butt gallery nothing is ever for sale please please please make sure your 18 plus before viewing and yeah go and check me out now I do need to address something I know I just made a video that said I was quitting that I was gonna quit smoking for a particular reason and unfortunately that reason fell through it was related to work and I'm the type of person that you know I love smoking weed and I wish we'd was my job like I wish this provided me with a lifestyle where I you know just smoke weed all the time unfortunately hey that's not why I'm doing this necessarily be I already have a job that I absolutely love and I wouldn't change for the world and I'm going it's going pretty good in that that realm so I don't know if I would want to switch it up because I just I just love doing these videos I'm smoking anyway so why not try to be helpful with people out there and you know just do it so you know but you mean don't get me wrong I would love to smoke weed as a job trust me but you know so bad this right here digging it so far I've really really digging it uh I'm already feeling pretty high I'm feeling really relaxed right now and as you can see we're only not even halfway through I've already started to feel really relaxed really called add up start to feel bloat too so I like the CBD cheese I might have to get some more and really go in maybe roll up a super fat bag would with a couple grams and really see how it goes maybe I'll do that but um anyway as I was saying about the last video I made that said I was quitting um so I was gonna quit and I was gonna bring you that journey I still may do that I may do that right before summer time um just to kind of give myself a reset but I don't know because I don't have to smoke now and for me this is a medicine this helps me out you know like I know there's people out there that are skeptical and don't believe that this is real medicine that really helps people out but this helps me out and it's not just with my anxiety but it helps me with my joint pains or I'm like I said I do I work in the concert industry and sometimes I do physical labor and you know feels good to smoke at the end of the night it helps ease the inflammation and helps me relax and get ready for bed so you know I do look at this as a medicine that's why I try to bring you guys the best meds I can possibly get my hands on out there so also real quick shout out to greed or alternative Michigan Avenue Detroit Michigan Southwest up for the assist on the CBD cheese that is where I go most of the time to get my medicine sometimes sorry guys if you're watching because I love all of you up there so much but sometimes I go to other spots just to kind of switch it up because like I said earlier I love to switch up flavors and you know they definitely do good at rotating flavors in there but I go in there I I smoke so much that like I almost run through the flavors like in a week so sometimes I go somewhere different to try it out and bring you something different you know so that's where that's at I was gonna quit smoking I really was I did watching you I was very nervous but it's been a minute since I haven't had to smoke alright since I've had to quit and so I was a little nervous about that but um but alas I do not have to quit and I will be bringing you more review videos maybe even if you smoke sessions it's about to get real nice here at the end of the week so I'm gonna try to bring you something different as far as a smoke session maybe some outdoors we'll see depending on how the weather is you know I only want to do that the sun's out so but yeah the CBD cheese band spurted slow pokey right now I can tell you what I love it I'm definitely gonna have to get my hands on some world no I've already said that but I do suggest if you're in the Detroit Michigan area and you like CBD IR strains with CBD in it if you come across some CBD cheese I suggest grabbing it I'm really actually digging this the more I smoke it the more I'm getting super relaxed so I'm kind of jumbled in my words and as you can tell so that means I'm getting really really relaxed getting blowback I really like this wow this is uh like I said this is my second time ever having CBD it has smoke form as you can see what are the first or second videos I put up on this channel I had some CBD gummies and those work phenomenally I try not to take them every day though because I don't want my body to build up to the CBD like it is the THC I want to be able to you know use that like what I really really needed you know when I'm really really feeling anxious so yeah I just want to thank everybody once again for tuning in let me know what you think in the comments if you've had CBD cheese as well let me know I really appreciate everybody thank you once again this is JB boy three one three signing off for the two for the night peace you", "NPpLPIkPI6U": "what's up youtube it's your boy medical marcels bringing you the blue cheese another strain you already know man get a load of it this [ __ ] is frosty got some purp in it this

review for blue cheese from Whistler cannabis company so according to leafy blue cheeses a combination of UK cheese and blueberry and Whistler cannabis company it's an all organic cannabis company it's sixty to ninety nine for an eight so it's much more expensive but it's a hand trimmed premium product so this 8 year was actually packaged on April 17th so this is by far the freshest stuff I've ever gotten here and the stats on this is eighteen point six percent THC and then less than 0.5% CBD so as you can see this one comes in this big cardboard package as compared to those plastic jars I do prefer this because I take it straight out of here and put it into one of my glass jars containers rather than just keeping it in the plastic so let's go ahead and open it up it's got just like open up their pre roll joints got these two things on the side to press those in pull this out I like this company because they do their packaging right I mean it looks like the buds are just pristine in here but it's also just perfectly sealed so they do a higher-end packaging as well compared to some of the other ones go ahead and open this up first smell mmm very very nice before we take a closer look at this I want to weigh it and since this does have a Boveda pack in there it should be pretty close to 3.5 so when I weigh this all out here it actually brings us to three point five four so that's nice to see it's usually you know three point four six if anything so it's nice to see a true proper eight let's go ahead and have a look at the buds here there are a really nice light green color and one thing I like about this company is that they hand trim everything it's not machine trim and you can tell cuz it just has a real connoisseurs trim on here you're not getting any big leaf or anything like that and the buds are just covered in orange hairs and just sticky with trichomes completely dense as well like that is a firm bud right there let's go ahead and smell it now that we've let it air out a little bit getting a little bit of kind of fruity or citrusy scents but nothing crazy not like a lemon tie or anything like that let's go ahead and bust it up and see how that changes it this is in my brilliant cut grinder absolutely love this guy try not to bust it too much this isn't the medium setting here okay now expose some of those terpenes let's go ahead and give that a fresh smell ooh much more aroma there that really really activated it getting a little bit of those blueberry a lot more of those fruit tones in there there's something just behind the fruit that I really smell and it's not an earthy tone very very nice though and be testing out today at the Arizer air 2 and this is a long boy stem so as you go to this longer stem here there's a custom-made one that we have I get this custom-made like this because with a longer stem it does cool down the vapor so it's not as harsh as you're gonna have an extended session I chose the air tube because of these all glass stems you get really really good flavor I'm going to turn this up to 380 degrees Fahrenheit KB just arrived at 380 Fahrenheit give it a second to reach temperature and let's go ahead and baby mmm pure terpenes there wow you can really taste that fruitiness coming through with that again you just feel like you're inhaling like pure Terps you know you're seeing the vapor but it's more of a blueish vapor I think it's when it's Terp heavy definitely getting some more of those fruit flavors the earthiness it's got some complexity to it [Music] you feel like you're kind of moving through the strange flavors you hit it you know I like the stranger it has complexity it's not just like citrus it just kind of changes through the bowl as you hit it very nice fourth hit I think that was a fourth of the fifth hit flavor is starting to diminish definitely still there I'm gonna go ahead and power vape the rest of this and then give it some time let the effects kick in so very nice Bowl nice and smooth good flavor you know what about the fifth hit sixth hit for sure starting to lose a lot of that flavor but very very nice and it changed you know over the course of those hits more fruit at first and then it moved through the other tones as well so I'm gonna give this 15 minutes let this kick in and I'll report back okay so it's been 15 minutes and that was a very very nice strain set it's about an 80% indica 20% sativa and I believe that because it's nice and relaxing but it wasn't like couch lock I wasn't feeling tired but very very at ease just chilling on the internet you know didn't really want to get up and do anything or anything like that but very relaxing I could see enjoying this one at night for sure but in the daytime I don't think it'd be too bad because it's not like a terribly tiring indica dominant strain so overall this is a really good one I mean it's expensive you're paying 60 299 for an eighth but at least you're getting really good quality stuff not only is it organic hand trimmed all that kind of stuff but it's really really tasty and the effects are great as well so overall if you don't mind spending the money and getting the higher end stuff this is a really really nice strain and I haven't tried one from these guys that I didn't like so there you go guys I hope you enjoyed this review of blue cheese from Whistler cannabis company I appreciate you watching these stray interviews and let me know which one you want to see next keep a green keep it sneaky and we'll see you next time", "tC_ITtwAJmg": "hey let's get out there YouTube world [ __ ] boy Bob Marley back with a new review today and today I'm gonna be reviewing blue cheese indica dumb and a really blue cheese indicate a jar right here so yeah blue cheese man let's take some off its gonna be some shake in there cuz like I say it's the end of the jar probably like a a flick just trying down look at that crazy funky looking bud and as soon as I took that out the jar it the wrong feel with this creamy blue Bay cheesy smell the kind of a creamy smell to the very loud so it's like a nice look at these but nice and frosty nice enough to kind of see how that frost just caked on my hand and I just did that but definitely a nice frost to a nice look to it blue cheese is an indica cross between blueberry male with an original UK cheese that's gonna phenotype female nice sweet savory berry and blue cheese combined with the creamy unique flavor of its original cheese heavy indica effects will help you relax by the end of the day can provide relief for muscle spasms pain and stress so a very you can see those look nice right there back there in a bag very nice trichomes very frosty skunky nice skunky smell but like I said a nice cheesy after smell but it's giving off a nice blueberry cream smell it's really dying coughing smoking on it's been one of my new favorites really so yeah I'm a sure way about gnarly back in the hippie TV with blue cheese lashes dank like I said not to drive they try to grab one of the denture bugs you can see the crack - it breaks down cakey inside light orange is very like thing but but he went to light down like a nice time so yeah I said that has been a new review about gnarly man blue cheese very good sure like I said indicator for nice heavy smokers man just [ __ ] should go for around thirty five forty AF are probably so about two hundred two zip somewhere around there so yeah I mean good but tell me what y'all think and tell me if y'all had it tell me if you haven't had it whatever so this is about the flash period and I even get a good look at see those light orange hair I say forgive a man about my freshman thanks everybody watching thanks Terry myself to new AP TV I'm up 1000", "T8TqkAYpw7U": "what's up stoners hearing aids back again for another strain review this time I got something real cool man we picked up some cheese here you guys have seen me review cheese wax and cheese shatter and stuff like that this time we actually got our hands on some of the flour a really nice stuff here man excellent manicure job really nice nice looking flowers so I'm gonna chop them up here and you're gonna get up close and personal take a really good look at this cheese alright guys it's time for an up and close personal look at this cheese you see the trim job here is absolutely beautiful this is a perfectly manicured bud and every bud in the bag looks just like this perfect like two and a half gram mugs that are beautifully trimmed this is very dense I'm giving it a pretty good squeeze here and you see there's no squish to this bud at all she is [ __ ] solid small trichome heads but definitely plenty of them to crack this open take a look on the inside there so yeah it's definitely some nice frosty stuff the hairs are beautiful strikes are beautiful the trim is beautiful and it smells amazing so uh yeah man there it is for up close and personal on the cheese so let's take it back out and have a talk the smell is absolutely beautiful very cheesy aroma sleep it earthiness not much at all very pungent hmm no anyway smelling good looking good absolutely everything's on point so far but while you guys were down there getting up close and personal with it I took the liberty of rolling up a little Penner for testing C purposes we're gonna have a couple puffs off this joint and talk to you guys about the strain here yeah so the cheese here or UK cheese as it's known in some circles because the screen was developed in the UK from a skunk one phenotype apparently that's the story so there was a skunk one fee no that really stood out because of the pungent cheesy aroma that was taken and then later on afghani genetics were added to it to increase the trichome yield and really dense up the buds and that worked because this is some debts [ __ ] and the flavors on point man there's some cheesiness going on here see we've got nice gray ash nice gray ash inside there signs of quality control in the grow I'm always looking for that it doesn't really say much about the strain but it does tell you if the grower took his time and you what he was doing it's a nice smoke a little bit tickly but in a good way it's really smooth very pungent like it's definitely cheesy definitely cheesy and the fact that it is a skunk one phenyl and you can tell like there is a little bit of that smokiness in there not skunky skunky but fruity skunky is in with the skunk one right no burning on the nose or anything like that now this cheese is an indica dominant hybrid skunk wanna had some indicating there and then Afghani is obviously very indica so you're gonna get some really nice relaxing effects I would imagine Greek for insomnia or anxiety really good for stress very good relaxing strain being indica dominant but there's just enough of those narrow leaf cultivar is there to make it a really happy buzz at the same time I'm actually really enjoying the smoke on this joint right here quite nice now about two-thirds of the way through the joint normally at this point I start thinking about putting it out depending on the flavor that I'm getting come in but the flavor hasn't really diminished it hasn't gotten raunchy yet so we can keep hitting I've been waiting to do a strain review on the cheese here for you guys for quite a while now very excited to finally bring this one to you and I got an excellent sample of the cheese to do my review with you guys see the manicure job it is perfect that is some pretty looking bud right there the smell is beautiful the taste is on point very cheesy very pungent smooth smoking clean burning we're getting through with joint now so almost ready to pack up the bull and finish up the review and then I'll be able to check in shortly and let you guys know what kind of effects I was able to get from that stuff so I'm gonna go ahead and put that out I still got a little bit on the tree here left from rolling that joint and we'll use that to pack up a bowl big my part with the dirty bong here guys it does get used Free Willy so we've had a joint we got to really experience the flavor get a kind of mild effect from it but I wanted really judge the potency of this stuff so I packed myself a nice fat bowl here we're gonna rip this down we can tell you how it's going to taste in the bong and then in a couple minutes like I said we'll let you know how the buzz is but cheers for the cheese very nice ultra cheesy very pungent oh thank my part it is very smooth don't let the choking believe that is a harsh walk very nice smooth smoked but like I said I'm gonna sit back for a while and check back in with you guys in a little bit okay all right what's up stars time for the buzz update you see here I'm on the couch that's because I haven't quite relaxed man I feel quite content to chill back here and just watch TV for a little while man pain-free

2015 and I know more about marijuana than any other physician that I've seen or spoken with so time to review some strains we're gonna be doing blue cheese right now and again it's by Alera and we got this from Keystone shops in King of Prussia on opening day or midnight the night before so this is going to be exciting alright let's get things started put that over so since we're in Pennsylvania we cannot unfortunately smoke marijuana now for my Delaware patients I recommend you do smoke because it's a great way to use marijuana it does not cause cancer it does not cause COPD or deteriorate lung function so why not well you can vaporize but you know if you're gonna use a vaporizer I recommend this one here this is uh this one's called the cloudiest nine and it's a great little device you can check the link below if you're interested in purchasing it and the reason I like it is because it's not only a vaporizer but it also acts like a bong both in its shape and in the water there okay so there's a little bit extra filtration in case there's any smoke in the vapor and again in Pennsylvania you're not allowed to smoke marijuana so the less smoke the better all right let's take a look at the strain we got here so we're going with blue cheese now I have used this before in Vegas so I'm familiar with the scent this one doesn't quite smell the way I remember it but let's take a look shall we nice and close up I'm gonna pull about out of this little container here beautiful so we got the top of a bud right here that's gonna be high quality I would say this one smells a little bit sweet like flowers and a little bit like like springy grassy smell to it it doesn't have the strong aroma I've had before in my blue cheese actually you know what I take that back I had cheese before just cheese this I believe is a cross between blueberry and cheese making it blue cheese how clever these breeders are so anyway it's got a little bit of purple hue to it on some of the trichomes and it's definitely frosty but aren't they all these days and feels a little light well trimmed I would say not the densest of nugs probably one you can crush up easily in your fingers yeah you definitely kind of Wow look at all that Keith coming out of it just from me crushing it like that so I don't want to waste it let's put it in the vaporizer it up another reason I like this vaporizer is because it's got a twisty little hook at the bottom that allows you to twist and move the contents while it's being vaporized so if we open this up we put a little bit of blue cheese strain inside he's got a little container in there little or I should say a little hole now we really want this thing very very very carefully ground up so I should be doing this with a grinder but for now I'll do with my hands just because I forgot that we're vaping and not rolling a J again if you're from Delaware I recommend smoking marijuana you can't get this though cuz you got to go to the Delaware dispensary and they don't have bleu cheese but you can get one of the others that they have there alright so I just put some of that in there there's a little bit on top there I'm just gonna gently I'll sure it into its hole get in your hole it's your home boom alright it's all in there in the chamber that's what I meant to call it in the chamber and now see this is the hook I was talking about on the other side so when you twist it it allows you to move the stuff inside a little bit and get more air everywhere that way you're not burning one area why not at all heating the other inside so we put this on top turn it over look no leakage not bad and maybe you got dropped there oh well but basically no leakage on this thing you turn it upside down and everything and let's give it a little try so I'm gonna turn some of these lights off because it's a little bit of a light spec spectacle when you use this thing yeah I'm ghetto this is how I turn off my lights all right now check it out it looks pretty too so here we go we're gonna try blue cheese by Alera I'm here in Pennsylvania using Pennsylvania's marijuana programs mayor strains marijuana James so I'm a Pennsylvania resident and I'm a Pennsylvania patient as well and then you wipe this screen off a little bit in case I'm not clear so I'm using only Pennsylvania products and you have to stick to what's legal in your state but luckily Pennsylvania's got some good stuff so let's give this flower a little try shall we here goes nothing turn it off with a press of a button boom oh yeah I got to let it warm up a little bit I believe I think that's how it works so we're gonna just wait a moment how's this work again I think it's on no hold on I said I've turned it on already I'm holding it down pressing the button letting go how embarrassing I don't even know how to use my thing is it not charged enough is that what's going on here huh Oh No failed review because it's not charged maybe I can plug it in and use it while it's plugged in let's see how lame that's why I'd like to do my reviews live so you guys can watch all the mistakes happen as they happen all right please work when it's plugged in maybe I'm using it wrong I haven't use this in a while because I haven't had to vaporize in a while or ever all right plugged in will it work while it's plugged in on one two three four five times six times now read okay cool now we got a little warm-up I think it's gonna turn green when it's ready so we're gonna turn it talked a little bit about the blue cheese strain and I'm gonna give you some information about it new cheese string alright let's find out so it's a cross of blueberry and cheese alright that was hard to predict flavors yeah apparently has the flavor of blueberry and cheese whatever alright it's heavier of an indica again I don't really think that matters too much if you smoked more of it it's gonna get you really high you know regardless and if it's a sativa or indica all right appearance and smell alright this is not interesting there's nothing interesting about bleu cheese really I think you got the major parts of it now if you guys want to know what kind of effects there are I will let you know but pretty much most marijuana strains are the same effects it's just what you expect them to be if you expect it to be an indica and get you real stone it's gonna do that if you expect it to have you be more lightheaded and energetic it's gonna make you do that because that's what happens with humans we expect something to happen and then we feel like it's happening because we expected it to happen so that's just natural alright I think this thing is loading is it warming up at all this might just be charging you're trying to think do I have any other vaporizers I don't even think I do I think this is the only one I have right now it's definitely warming up so I think it's gonna turn green soon right I might have to check how this thing works again now it's and even on this is what a rock review I failed it all right [ __ ] I don't even have any other beeps aah how'd you smoke this [ __ ] on stream please or am I gonna get like my license revoked because I can't use my medication or not because my [ __ ] vaporizers not working ah alright I gotta look up how to use this thing cuz I've only used it once it was on stream it was awesome but now I forgot how to use it okay cloud is just line by hydrology 9 where's the instructions [ __ ] yes I'm 18 go away alright about us our shipping policy affiliates support where the hell do I use it parts and accessories so it's just about the hydrology 9 vaporizer how do you turn this thing on I don't even know all right I give up yeah I guess it's just got a charge still maybe it ran out of batteries and it just didn't it wasn't charged how do you know it's done charging charging bull how do you know if it's totally charged yeah I don't know how to even use this thing I think it's just gotta charge more come on you should be charged already oh it's like a vaporize you gotta click it many times duh all right cool there we go now we can use it so I just didn't know how to use it I'm an idiot all right let's let this thing load see look it's purple it's gonna go green when it's ready god I'm dumb sorry about that won't happen again hopefully there's people watching I didn't even check to see all right this thing's gonna load it's gotta change color it'll change to green when it's ready and let me check the stream make sure everybody's cool [Music] [Music] why is this thing not working now [ __ ] this there we go all right it's nice thing even working and is this thing heating up I can smell it heating up look it's green all right we're gonna take it now my mouse doesn't work lovely why would my mouse not work all of a sudden why were your work alright let's just take a hit god damn it how come my mouse not be working right now it is a stick hit I didn't even realize that a shotgun on it all right good you got a little bit of a hit now it's got a one rack up again alright good I took a hit uh-huh um I think I mean some vapor came out let's see how much is left in this I kind of want to see what's going on all right some of its burning some of its Brown some of its green I definitely like putting it as high as possible hopefully get a little bit of smoke in there I mean no you're not allowed you never mind it's ridiculous I think I definitely got some smoking in the vapor there cuz it tastes like it all right cool so that was a little tiny little amount of marijuana how do I feel it's definitely taking effect but I need more a lot more is this thing done let's turn it on again how do I choose the temperature setting oh look red blue yellow orange purple red alright I want what's the highest one what's this the highest strength I don't know what the high setting is right now we'll find out we're figuring out this vaporizer together other instructions hydrology 9 vaporizer oh it's green it's ready they take a hit let's take another hit we're gonna we're gonna take another one maybe you're not supposed to cover that hole because I'm getting bigger hits without covering it what's the hole for I don't even know I don't know if I'm supposed to cover the hole or not where does the air come from if I cover up that hole though I don't know where the air can go through all right blue cheese I don't know I think it's all right for we're gonna have to gauge every strain based on one filling of one of these okay because that way it'll be even I don't have much to route to to compare it to but it's a pretty good strain I feel alright with it it's definitely I there's a good strain I think how do I feel I don't know kind of high I guess it feels a little more like an indica I don't know I need more all right let's see the comments what's going on everybody thanks guys good to see you too Jason all right I'm just gonna take this [ __ ] out all right so take a look at what the weed looks like now it's kind of gross I'm gonna put the light back on maybe just here all right it's kind of gross like brown before and after now look at that what is that after let's take a look at the before one more time so we can compare look that weeds basically burned I mean it's not but there's definitely some blackness to it my gosh like dark ass Roma for some all right take a look before and after again so after before it looks better than ash I guess pretty nasty apparently you can cook this stuff and then it'll give you a little bit more but I know there's THC in there cuz if I smoke that I bet you it would get me high I don't see too much green so the vaporizer actually did a pretty good job Gary to the green you know I think it baked it as well as you can you know as anything can alright I'm gonna take another head I miss smoking weed I don't want to get my license taken if I do that on stream or something so I guess I better do this I miss being a Delaware patient because really I when I was a Delaware patient I could smoke because they're you're allowed to and it was better for me it worked better for me in general than vaping so I don't know I guess I have to recommend a worse form of use to my patients because honestly sorry hydrology 9 but smoke is better than beeping I think unless unless it's already in a concentrate or prefilled cartridge but try herb smoke or tyre beepings I don't know how to explain it it's like O'Doul's beer you're drinking beer but somehow it doesn't feel the same alright there it is let's take another hit I guess it's like a one-hit pauper pretty much if you think of it that way I can't do this I think I'm gonna have to just smoke weed because I know all you guys are smoking it so it's just not fair because I get I'm supposed to set an example or something but I know you guys are all smoking it and it's kind of not good for patient care that they made this law like this because it's impractical it does not translate clinically at all no one's actually like most people are gonna be smoking it so then it forces them to lie about it to me because they don't know if I'm gonna you know be angry about that because you're not supposed to I can't really talk to them about it and talk to them about their way they really use it because they're not telling me the truth now even if they tell me the truth and they're just vaping it we're using a suboptimal form of use of marijuana here or of inhalation at least can't smoke marijuana - [ __ ] it out [Music] to my Delta patients I recommend you smoke it to my PA patients no illegal highly illegal to do that extremely illegal Delaware very good smoke away unbelievable it's a free country there's a constitution like let us just I don't know why do they have to put this distilling like extra rule there all right here we go let's warm this up and get it going all right it's on red once it's on green we're gonna hit it hard all right so I guess we want right do you want red you're doing on something else this vaporizer got a lot of really good reviews though that's for sure got great reviews online so you know I'm not gonna lie it did work on me fairly well all right are you green yet no soon it's beautiful though isn't it it's a beautiful vaporizer already been babe yo doc is this opposing 360 because I think it got messed up again [ __ ] is it not 316 I said really D previews oh my god it's not 360 I'm restarting the stream [ __ ] my life stop stream how did it not be 360 no it is 360 what are you talking about it yeah it's working see look I got her here 360 right is this me talking yeah isn't me talking cuz I should curse now I wanna be like [ __ ] see I'm pissed now I got to stop doing that I gotta be way more song FRA now that is a vocab word yeah I knew I was gonna pull that one out from somewhere deep inside I'm definitely not being that word by the way right now oh it's private I see what's going on here I got two live streams going and I copied one of the next but for some reason one of them is goddammit one of them is live the other one isn't or yeah one of those public one is private hold on geez no stop edit video pull people watching and it's such a shitty video it actually looks kind of cool with the 360 like this it actually doesn't look pretty cool cuz you know when I get up close to the camera it is like I'm just taking up most of this space but still it it's meant to be 360 how did that happen this video is 360 save changes does it do anything now all videos all changes saved let's take a look did it get any better does it suddenly morph into 360 I don't think so no it's like [ __ ] now once you start at 9 360 you know it doesn't stay in it I'm gonna redo this dream I think cuz I'm pissed that this is not in a 360 camera or whatever like oh like before all right stop I'll be right back I promise", "bHnB6NCnvTs": "[Music] [Music] yes yes people lucky lucky lucky we

doing is geez [Music] yeah I got whatever that is [Music] so the cheese is 80% indica [Music] the first thing I noticed about about it was if you have a problem with no appetite then you want to give this one a try it goes almost instantly instantly made me hungry and that no no just an effort for me the slip really is a good appetite [Music] oh my goodness this couch [Music] anyway it has a THC level of 20% and [Music] it's good for muscle spasms it's good for [Music] okay screw fur stress depression [Music] it's good for anxiety ADHD [Music] which will now [Music] it's it's pretty nice stone it's uh you know it has 2% CBD in it it does have a numbing effect on my arm although I still feel it it's not it's not taking away one percent and that feels good so [Music] it's uh I'm sorry

blue cheese week nine stay high peace the [ __ ] out", "-12PswSKhBM": "hello and welcome to another episode of Rufus eats cheese today we are looking at the heavyweights that's right blue cheese okay first up we have got five lovely blue cheeses here separated them into two groups those of you need cheese might know why those who don't know individual cheese's - well you're probably thinking hmm okay so I'm gonna start with this one because we are in the presence of aristocracy this is the great rock for a French cheese that we believe has been made since 1050 so that's that's a pretty good heritage isn't it all the other blue cheeses here have the exact same blue vein mold grown in them mold requires Afric to breathe so the cheese is usually are either spikes or they have already plenty of air pockets in them so with the rock for here as you can possibly see it's quite a gooey liquid cheese in fact when I opened it there was quite a lot of liquid in there made only from the milk of the Lacan sheep so this Roquefort cheese was the first cheese to receive the protected designation of origin it was in 1951 but its protection goes back a long way before that the caves that it's butchered in where the mold originally comes from have been protected since the 15th century in 1666 a law was passed in France that people who were making fake rock for bogus rock for that were not from the area would be punished so it sounds a bit like one of those crimes that probably had quite a severe punishment for effectively bootlegging cheese the the protection was given apparently because the village of rock floor where this is made is it six hundred and thirty meters which is about two thousand and sixty feet and you can't grow grape vines there you also can't grow corn or anything else so sheep and cheese was really their thing I think this is one of the reasons it received OCS a very fine cheese but one of the reasons it received its protection so early because they couldn't really grow too much else there moving on we have to be sure a lot of you will recognize a nice English Stilton this Stilton is from long Clausen it's one of a handful of dairies that are entitled to make Stilton and still also has a protected designation of origin as I've mentioned it has the same and the cylinder rock 40 mold the mold that grows through the cheese to provide air for it the cheese is actually spiked with stainless steel spikes I believe they would have been copper originally so yes this is also a very fine cheese very lovely and over here we have the magnificent gorgonzola quite hard to manage in terms of moving if I just try and lift this up you'll see just how soft that gorgonzola is there are two kinds of gorgonzola one of them is a mature or piquant version and this is the Dolce or sweet version which is my favorite the exact same mold that's growing in the rock for gorgonzola is also an extremely old cheese and also has a protected designation of origin over on our other board here this is kind of the VIP club over here these are our our truce 18 sensations that would really like to be in this club but don't quite make it yeah so first of all we have swaps you're blue now shorts are blue is a gorgeous cheese there is nothing wrong with the cheese itself there's no no reason in terms of its taste or anything else that it doesn't qualify if you like the reason it's over here is Shropshire blue is made in Shropshire and the surrounding area but it's only recently been that way Shropshire blue was originally an attempt by a Scottish dairy to copy or to mimic Stilton this one is also from a Stilton factory so it's producing exactly the same place as the Stilton the Stilton has a huge heritage and a protected designation of origin and the Shropshire blue being a gorgeous cheese does not get this these perks should we say the last one here is Danish blue a particular favorite of mine very much like the rock for it's a very soft very creamy cheese with the same blue vein and I rather like it so we have here our five cheese's the question is does the rock four really deserve its title of king of cheese I think we needs better to the test really so I'm gonna get in and I'm gonna try some so here we go most of our mold is in the middle so I'm gonna cut so I'm gonna cut through the middle and then I'm gonna take the piece off here they just the smell is incredible it's fairly strong but it's also really fresh and I tend to find that with sheep's milk or use milk cheeses it sounds strange but you can definitely tell that this cheese has come from an animal that might sound a bit strange but it was definitely retained some of that sort of an animal nature to it let's go to try hmmm god that is incredible the first hit you get is salt first thing is salt and very very soon afterwards you start to get of some lactic tones but they're not the same as the lactic flavors that you get with a cow's milk cheese you'll also notice it's quite white as well I believe that's because there's no bitter carotene in the milk beautiful you can still taste the milk which is really interesting um it's also quite fascinating it with as much salt as it tastes this is in there the mold still grows so you would think perhaps it would be a little too salty for them all to grow but I don't think that's the case it's beautiful it's very very crumbly if I try and take another piece off here you can see just how crumbly is that's actually fallen upon even taking it off there so it is a very crumbly cheese mmm beautiful fabulous you can really you can really taste sheep's milk which is quite unusual a lot of cheeses become very much a product of their own and you don't get this you don't get to actually feel that original milk moving on with my little carousel here we're going to come round to the gorgonzola the wonderful gorgonzola it actually almost looks like you've poured cream all over it it does look pretty gilli lovely wow it's so soft it's so soft and gooey now this is not one that he's crumbly in any way if you look there it's just very very soft beautiful right this try piece very different so the first flavor you get the first thing that hits your town is a sweetness and then this beautiful creaminess almost like clotted cream and there's quite a delay before you get the the lovely bitter notes of the mold coming through so let me try another piece just just to make sure that's fabulous it's really young and fresh still it's not an overpowering cheese with them afterwards you get this wonderful just a hint from the mold almost like you've eaten two separate things so you get the creamy smoothness of the cheese and the mould is like a little pub tuition afterwards beautiful really gorgeous cheese right I am gonna Nick this one and we will go Wheel of Fortune again I think probably the best thing to do understand our piece of stealing up I'm gonna take a piece off here now I happen to know it still is quite salty so I have some expectation that if you look this is almost a mixture you can see the edge has crumbled it does crumble but it's also quite moist so it does move as one piece it's it's almost halfway between the the crumb of the rock 4 and the gorgeous using tastiness of the gorgonzola but it is of course much drier cheese as well than both of them so I'm just gonna have a quick almond to help clear the flavor of the other two and we'll dive in so a much stronger nose you can smell you can actually smell the bitterness of the rind let's give it a try hmm it's so different from the others immediately there's a bitterness from the mold but the texture is so different the texture is completely different from the other two so there's also a saltiness and it's definitely something of the farmyard still in there which I love in a cheese hmm it's beautiful the Stilton is particularly nice with a cracker or something similar the gorgonzola the Coen Zola Dolce I particularly like to have as it is just with some wine or something I rather like that it's very gooey it would be perfect to spread on something but personally I like to have it as it is so mmm moving on moving on to our other board so I think I think we should taste the Shropshire blue as it is right here mmm so similar in consistency to the Stilton it's firm but it also has a slight tastiness to it so if you squeeze it with your fingers it's very easily moved hmm a very different creature the Stilton similar texture so the structure blue has a very similar consistency and texture to the Stilton but it doesn't have that initial bitterness that you get with the Stilton it's also less salty so if you kind of like Stilton but it's a bit much for you structured blue be an amazing alternative it also has so much character the rind is lovely as well I do find the rind on the Stilton a little tart at times but the rind on the choice of blue is particularly lovely okay so finally moving to our last cheese the Danish blue this is a very commercial cheese this is not half the intense heritage of the protected designation cheese's here on the other board but I do rather like it I think it's a really nice little cheese it has the the moistness of the rug for but a little firmer it's not quite as firm as the Stilton but it's a little firmer and definitely much firmer than the gorgonzola the distribution of the rock for mold through the cheese is quite thorough so in that sense it's it's a little more like the rock for but but it's as if it's been mature longer which it actually hasn't a much more sour note to it hmm lovely as a lovely cheese it's slightly slightly more resistant in the mouth than the gorgonzola but it has a lovely saltiness a lovely bitterness a lovely sourness to it and it's also still reasonably firm you can still pick it up move the fingers hmm it's a fabulous cheese it is quite a strong flavor quite intense flavor unlike the other cheese's it doesn't leave a little sting at the back of your throat which I rather like but again if you've got something to put this on like some crackers or some sourdough bread or something this is a fabulous cheese okay I hope that was useful thanks very much for watching please like share and comment below if you disagree with anything I've said or I've clearly missed out a blue cheese that

dense these are really really really dense real good I guess isn't purple in there oh yeah listen darling see this is another another deal where it's one one buds really dark and one but it's really light looks really nice even without to my magnifying glass oh yeah there's some hairs in there too okay so let's give this a taste maybe go with the cuz I'm an imperial so this piece me it's really strong with terpene really really strong it's really um right in the front of the tongue really really really bitter hmm that's pretty strong stuff and it's really fibery like like it's nuit it's still and I don't think it's fully dried yet it's still kind of moist I mean it doesn't feel it to touch it though but to chew it it's kind of chewy and moist it's not all dry like it looks it's really nice slowly strong potent terpene though wait all right so I guess we'll just take off at this bud I think I looks really bright even though it's dead darker the - it still looks pretty bright I can see the orange hairs they look really nice okay that looks like good light there yes pretty nice look how I got all right so we're gonna put some in our taster it's called a glass taster taste it hmm does it taste moldy no no it doesn't taste like blue cheese like moldy whatnot but it's very dry like it doesn't feel very dry but it's still it has like very dry smoke to it it's like it's like the middle the back of my throat just get super family here all right so being that they were both two different two different colors one light green in one dark green I'm gonna have to start figuring out what causes that I don't know maybe if it's just where it's groaner where's positioned in the field or what but it's now that I'm seeing it more and more it makes me curious so I don't done you guys see me now you can see I didn't really be able to see him exhale Wow cameraman Scott he's got really good lungs compared to me you see all that that's crazy get it on the way out or away guys don't get to move around a lot really underneath yeah there you go so what do you think camera is it dry them to you when you feel feel dry yes or no no yeah that's why there's tool this year so the daily thing the daily thing the packaging is black that's different I mean if I was like packaging blue cheese I would like maybe make the wrapper look like a cheese you know I'd be pretty cooling the Marbley blue cheese and this sticker would be kind of something that I would probably do the the picture itself isn't bad as again I still like the uh being able to see the one side in the package um its overall smell and taste it was very punchy any smell it's very strong um I can't say earthy I mean I hear that a lot very earthy smell um I can't I didn't get that with this I got more like a more like a probably a sweet grassy smell an earthy smell because to me Earth doesn't smell like screwed grass to me earth smells kind of like dirty wood so I don't get an earth smell what's that and doughy wood dirty would like doyou know like you go into a barn and it's like the wooden air is like Oh dusty and dirty and it has that smell that's the earthy smell to me whereas this is more like a sweet grassy smell like like maybe like you just not like you just mowed the lawn but sort of like that it's good grass smell so tasting it was very strong um it was fibery but not dry but yet the smoke was kind of dry so that was kind of like it's kind of just disconcerning in some ways me like so it's not necessarily bad just being with the things that it kind of had as traits I wasn't expecting that and its flavor when we smoked it was still pretty good even though the smoke was still kind of even dry and third category would I would I would I give it in one to five stars one being the worst by being the best um I give it a four and a half we not feeling it feels pretty good yeah I mean I give it a four and a half it feels good it was it displeasing in flavor and what I recommend the product yes I personally would recommend this product two reasons one is potent I feel it I'm not sure how much is this probably at least 16 percent to you've seen here fuels in 70 what's that it means see really early SRC THC amen I'm sorry guys um you know these things happen I would say there's at least 16% CBD my mistake well you know why I said that because I just read that Michigan and and was you know state Utah they're all legalizing so sorry you know maybe that's probably what um actually they did legalize recreational so I'm saying it must be at least 16 percent CBD in here I mean it it feels pretty good you know it's not like over the edge medicated but it feels good so it's not like in the 19 or 20 let's say it's in around the 16 percent um so that's why I would recommend it that and the fact that it's very dense and it's very good it looks great these buds look great and they're very dense which means you're going to get a lot out of it when you break it up and that little bits going become a whole bunch and supplemented with like some like some high slit or something you know on top if you did it in a bowl I'd be really cool I think that would really like set it off in fact um I think if we do another if we do another review here soon of some concentrates we should use this to put it smoking in a bowl most people do it in a matter they're do it on the nail you know you've seen it but there's other ways you can use it so why not I think that'd be good for that don't forget the contest in it hashtag in it number two win like subscribe

"0rkn_kc3UF4": "here's a strain review on the dining film blue cheese Auto frog overall is a really great strain to grow mmm it was a beast for an auto flower it was over 3 feet tall very wide and bushy you had a lot of colors and really really fat boats they aren't in dances buds but they're not too fluffy either they're kind of dance but not as dense that the pineapple Express was very very frosty strong smells amazing smells more on the blueberry side are the fruity side compare through the cheesy skunky side smells more fruity it has a very stony high very strong strong Chi which is surprising because I didn't let this plant go until the trichomes turn amber I harvested when the trichomes were milky no Emperor comes at all and that's one of the reasons why the wax that I made from it the butter came out white like completely white but uh yeah so it has a pretty stony high for the milky trichomes just like a kind of like couch lock I which is supposed to be how it is with the truck amber trichomes that anyways the buzz look great and the hash that I made when we came out great nice fruity Stern but it gets Tony high and here's some flaky butter consistency hash oil that I made from some material that I had already made wax from so actually I run much trim or my buds whatever I used twice and this is the result of the second time of use extracting the THC from the material I was using and I actually mixed the pineapple express material with the blue cheese material before I extracted the TAC and this is the final product tastes really really good both of the flavors together are amazing those two strains will be a crazy cross break that's about it yes my blue mammoths are no flower we'll be harvesting soon so stay tuned peace out", "JMG22T8_7oI": "hey everyone since today I'm gonna bring you a strain review of some blue cheese it's I grew it it's organic and door like its crystallized I don't know if the light shows it but it is very crystallized smokes very nice that's really good flavor that's the smell of both blueberry and cheese it's got that that cheese that sweetness of the cheese but unless it's more like an upper like a nut like how would you describe that cheese now it's not like cheese it's more just really sweet not fruity but just a really sweet smell it's with the blueberry which is another sweet smell but very very like very uh smells blue you think blue when you think of this smell it's a lot like a blueberry okay don't defects for this it's very relaxing it does get you for like the first half hour it has a nice head effect that comes in and leaves you just really relaxed Anila just got that cheese head effect now first 30 minutes and then the blueberry relaxed happy euphoric scoot it all around effect I don't break the nut gout free little bit did you give you I see so you can see while the crystals and sat down very clean such smokes very smooth as well it's the organic this has been my favorite smoke lately I went to I'm gonna smoke a good amount of it just all personal just a lot of nice buzz a lot someone a packet in the go spot herb burner don't need too much I smell it's really sweet and fruity berry never it does it leaves a really nice taste in your mouth whoo that tastes this stuff I keep smoking just for the taste just cuz it tastes so good I can that's what I keep smoking alright

now you know you know yeah the UK strain comes from Britain it actually used to be called Expo does cheese but they change it to UK cheese and I'm really excited for this this is good for anxiety depression stress its number-one medicinal is for relief it is it's pain really yeah it's good from chronic pain to good as extreme lupus but this stop is some really good quality medication alright don't you bring this out to you and I I can't even wait to rate it you know how we do here we look at the weed we smell the wheat we taste the weave and then we judge wisely all very important stuff I already opened the bank and it's such a pungent yeah yeah you rock the UK she is before you know what right we should probably look at it first I get over the smell I'll give you a little nugget yeah the smell is so this bud is a nice light green to it nice healthy it's not too dense yeah yeah it is and I find it already sticky not sticky as a nuke in that we reviewed a few weeks ago but like she that's even busting it was very like sticky gosh I guess doctors right yeah totally well since you have it let's give it a win right so this bad boy to me is some musty cheese it's 100 percent blue cheese yeah it definitely does a bit of earthy and I actually get like an undertone of berry a little bit of it mm-hmm those champions I tell you this like is some crazy like I never smelt this strain that has such a new unique smell such as the foliar yeah that's how you know what's actually - yes hold like to use it actually smells like like cheddar cheese yeah you know this stuff is actually really good for daytime use I wanted since its sativa dominant and it's really good for its medicinal purposes but we won't get that crash like other strings you'll be able to pursue the day conquer

slaw yeah I'm feeling this for sure not like it sounds good daytime use mmm birthday time all right yeah I wonder if it would because I've never smoked this before going to bed some strains like my - keeps racing if it's a very very high sativa it's sometimes can't even sleep so I wonder if this would give the same effect because I'd like completely feel relaxed like coming my buddies knows I couldn't bring my bong today I asked her a she had a vlog and do we have something to show you am I sure all of us I've done this at least once in our life we need sincere but like 16 then that means

a body numbing euphoric sensation unlike most indica blue cheese is an uplifting yet very Spacey and forgetful strain it can be used as a good daytime medicine this strain might temporarily affect complex cognitive functionality which must be taken into consideration prior to medicating blue cheese is easy to cultivate and flowering lasts between eight to ten weeks one can expect to crop out by late September with a yield of approximately 500 grams per square meter for more information about your favorite bud visit WWE won adductors for 1/1 calm now [Music]", "ZMCyCHrK4Yk": "I smoked how you doing I'm back today with normal video and we are going to be taking a look at the famous white widow cannabis train this train is proper old school cool if you've been in Amsterdam in the 1990s you would have encountered this and it's still around today guys so I managed to get myself a lovely sample of this one below but I've got it here for you guys today I hope that you are ready for another iced mocha review and that wherever you are you are going to be smoking along and let's take a look in a bit more detail guys the first thing to say about the white widow is oh my god the buds the buds are fantastic they have been clearly cut to perfection and has left this strangling really really tasty and delicious you get this sort of earthy almost woody smell coming from the buds that just reminds me of an old bag of weed when I was like 15 16 when I first smelled it it might have been this strain or something very similar because this to me is the traditional cannabis smell it's got no some additional smells low fruitiness no berry no hazy it's just got this cannabis stench which is delicious I've actually had a cure in for a little while longer who's ready to go put it in a glass jar and smelling better over the week that I've had it so yeah this is [ __ ] tasty guys and it is a really good kind of a strain and my pleasure to review with you guys today so what we're going to do now is I'm going to show you a close-up of the butt and you can have a look at yourself see just how good it is really really good trim job then really dense I think it's due to the way that it's been imported I don't know where this has come from it wouldn't surprise me if it was someone like Holland it's quite compressed but not too much so the buds are solid but they're not sort of over crushed together and as a result you get this lovely sort of odd formation here yes they probably did look better when they come straight off the plant but I cannot complain with the quality of this bit of cannabis because it looks and smells and tastes absolutely delicious so the overage hairs in this or I'm sure we have close up you've seemed in a lot more detail but looking with my eyes they aren't very apparent they're not like some kind of estranged UCLA while big orange hair some overtaking the bus which somebody mentioned to me could be a sign of heat stress this hasn't got any of that is all quite uniform in color Oh school old school cool is a cross between a Brazilian sativa landrace and a resin heavy indica which is from South India and it's bred quite greenhouse seats and it was bred a long time ago it's one of the most famous strains in the world I know all of this anyway but I just wanted a little bit of backup what I'm going to do today I've actually purchased a new micro Greek and this is my new bomb because that one broke and I'm between bombs at the moment to grind up some of this and we're gonna pack it into the bomb we're gonna let you know how it tastes and what the effects are so gonna grind up fresh grind up the house move these are when they're fresh you know don't get this up a blind off to use their few times look at that it's almost working your hair got using it just gonna keep that spoon look hypnotic [Applause] anyway this but some of this why we don't net and shame to to break up those when we've still got some nice juicy little mugs say goodbye to this mean actually this grown-up ever get stuck with the resinous crystals as you can see it pops out by lighting the grind up because it's nice and compressed and tasted that looks lovely smells like old school kenja without further ado I'm gonna put some in my bomb now my first form of the day and then we can stop letting you guys know what the effects are like goes the only issue with those plastic binders that haven't got a sort of compartment for the week to go through to it you don't catch the leaf or the the stalk sometimes a little bit comes through or stays in there whereas when you use the bigger crime is you've got that extra layer which is sort of usually catches a lot of the leaves that I've got obviously this has been trimmed well so there's not a lot but just a little bit of smoke in the middle was was left in that so just that to watch out otherwise I would have liked my bottom tastes nasty and that's not what we want put some hemp wick here I've stopped opening new hemp wicks I need to find some of my old ones and to be honest I don't know if I see the flavor difference you know I mean I need to do a video comparing it because with a lighter and we have wick icing tastes relatively similar but let's see guys let's see how this one widow tastes through the bomb and I think it goes nice Cheers [Applause] [Music] mmm very smooth very smooth fog the place is incredible like I think because the bonds smaller it seems to be quite a little to taste it'll be better than my previous bomb which I'm really surprised this was eight quid and that's not like a lot to pay for a big glass until I've got this top of the market still just because I saw and it reminded me of my one in Amsterdam and I was like [ __ ] it okay [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and it trips me this one is brilliant the pole is there three times the size of the other bunk I'll be using even though this is smaller yeah really good experience I can report that that was really tasty I'm still bit ill at the moment as you can hear from my voice I'm still struggling I've got quite a bad cough in terms of smoking it for a bong it's really really smooth it's a lovely flavor it's not harsh it doesn't make you want to cough up it's a pure sort of taste and it is a hybrid of indica and sativa so it's quite a balanced strength so you get the relaxing chilled out feeling of the indica you also do feel quite happy and uplifted as the sativa side of the hybrid kicks in so how am I feeling now the bong is starting to wash over me now and I'm feeling the familiar sort of relaxing feeling spreading across my shoulders and working its way down the double-bond first thing in the morning was a great idea it is poke me up I was tired this morning his self my appetite I'm now gonna go and have some breakfast and it is yeah a nice bit of weight guys so I'm glad that I could share that with you and I really hope that you've enjoyed the white widow review parallels can be drawn I feel between this and the Northern Lights train that I reviewed the other week because they're both old school strains and both of mantastic I'll pick them both up whenever I get the chance to it actually tastes really nice in a vaporizer as well very clean very fresh and that's the sort of thing that you want guys in the daytime smoked because you're not gonna want something that's just gonna blow your head off if you've got stuff to do something like this white widow is a lovely stroke once your thoughts and opinions on this guys have you smoked

UK will be back soon with another video keep talking guys hey guys so it's been about 20 minutes since sudden bongs how am I feeling I'm feeling great actually and it's not something that I expected to overpower me it is as I keep mentioned in old-school cool and it's a really relaxing but also a lovely mellow strain so I am completely functional while I got the nice relaxing effects of the indica in the uplifting effects of their sativa side from the balance of the cross I don't feel like smashed if you watch my holy grail video last week you'll see their aftermath which shows me looking quite [ __ ] I don't feel like that at the moment I actually feel quite did not but I didn't feel good before but I mean I feel relatively sober still off they're doing two bombs of it so yeah it's a great strain guys I have been smoking it for about a week now and that might be something to do with why my tolerance is probably quite high to this particular strain but yeah in terms of the THC content I wouldn't say that it's a it's up there with some of the strongest strains by is the lovely smoke", "SyVXK4ojkw4": "you know what's going on you two yeah this is the final days of the blue cheese Otto do I'm gonna focus them see how this Galaxy Note work okay there's no note three right here you can see it got a bunch of deficiencies I start really giving the notes because I was getting um like I know you can't see never like mushrooms was drawn out the [ __ ] dirt and [ __ ] so I stopped giving that [ __ ] notes and just giving it water and then mushrooms stopped growing out of the dirt so that's why it's like it's a lot of this you can see the deficiencies in the [ __ ] leaves and stuff it was either no deficiencies are mushrooms or bud and clean dirt well it's looking good a couple more days on what I'm really about to do though I know people don't advise this like when I started that DWC and there's a lot of light lastly i just used basic water and i put no nutrients with nothing in there I'll just use basic water all matter of fact I didn't even pH it so I'm just about to UM dump that bucket out because now the roots in that plant our far enough to reach the water before I just needed to write sort of what the moisture I don't know why it's not focusing sorta with the moisture just to get the moisture and have a recover from being transplanted from dirt to PwC I said look like it's all well and good now so I'm about to just use that that five gallon bucket and this little last one gallon I'm going to just flush use that water to flush all this [ __ ] out and then when it's dry and bout to cut this down probably they say look dark now but like only flushed it really twice I want to get a third flushing on it cuz I just had some bud that wasn't flush good that really scared me I didn't I mean I just smoked some bud that wasn't flush good at all and I said it burned my nose like [ __ ] bad [ __ ] or something I don't know but yet is that Auto blue cheese it's just a couple of days old now I'm gonna confused it's a couple days old you haven't seen my videos I know how low it is I don't know what videos I want to put up first but I got a couple videos from site B as I want I got a new site and I got that outdoor jump all too so I got a couple videos to put up got this new cam right all right let me zoom in on this home let me zoom in on this whole four time zone wanna know three okay it's not gonna [ __ ] all its gonna automatically that is [ __ ] my hand so on state oh yeah nice little buzz you know I can't wait to smoke but yeah so what I did with this home put this back in here well yeah what I did with the [ __ ] on that my OG Kush is trying to get her parole she pushes I took him to my people's house to other the ones I thought [ __ ] just not much home other other videos and [ __ ] and these shits right there I took clippings of them for clippings off a one of them tool from each one and gave them to my people so they can sex them so I can see what they are before I do anything with them and then that's the one that's in a DWC now you see it's starting to recover more no growth and everything I'll show you how to I'm talking about see see now before it was none of that [ __ ] so I'm just gonna use that water on the hose right there and then cuz I need to change the water because it's been in there for like two weeks like ever since I transplanted it a pretty rare y'all remember that video the 17 people who did watch me well probably 13 cuz I not watched it two or three times but the inner glow to old he pushes and sir Leah this [ __ ] coming on it's just faint like this honestly like this should sting like I can smell this [ __ ] that's alright I never grown the cheese before I never had any luck on cheese let's old I welcome to the crib I smell the I smell that cheese literally that little eyes plant and this is in my closet door closed official it's not in the air on mic and I could still smell that huh so yes I know what's getting done I still want to flush it though I probably don't need to really [ __ ] but I don't know that's [ __ ] to mushroom shits that was going out of that [ __ ] is pretty much screwed it scared me the Ergo quick little five-minute video whatever it just last year before I dropped it down y'all see I got the HP sm m enough orange miss ya dwc alright", "p8j9jBngGI4": "howdy folks tell us a little smoke session aggro log today were to talk about the famous blue jeans let's get into this today sampling a product from a fellow caregiver here in the state of Michigan who happens to have a phenomenal outdoor grow because in the state of Michigan you can have an outdoor grow in the case that as long as it's an enclosure and then certain municipalities have regulated against it but where I happen to live in the state of Michigan and he lives quite a far away from for me even he's in the middle of nowhere even farther out of out of the beaten path than that I am so he has no neighbors to contend with and he follows law he has all four sides covered and then a netting over the top and if I can get some permission at one point to bring you some video I will absolutely do that but he is definitely one of those types that is uh let's say likes to stay private and is an old school and definitely not a youtuber all right so as we continue on here talking so much my joint went out man so yeah this was his my unnamed friends Sour Diesel grown outdoors it is very acceptable especially for the price per foot square footage because unlike here you know I don't have a couple lights on for this video but you know it caused money to burn them suckers when you have the brightest light bulb in the sky out there give feeding your plants all that great energy it's good but unfortunately you just don't get them just a different type of smoke it just doesn't have the potency I don't think probably because all the crystals are being knocked off during the wind and then the trouble i have i've always had without door pros is bud rock so we've been really watching for that but back to the topic of today's grow long this is a seed from i've already lost name and such as how it goes and i'm not going to try to murder it I'll have to take better notes for next time a dinafem it came back whoa dinafem seats unfortunately when I contacted them directly they told me due to the federal regulations they weren't able to ship me seeds but they then graciously pointed me to suppliers that would send seats and so I just ordered me a couple blue cheese and I'm calling it bc ng here because i do have blue cheese from my patient who provided me with several teenage plants she could no longer take care of him and I finished them out but unfortunately I'm having some trouble with them they seem to tend to have a little bit of autoflower activity going on I don't know if it stresses I'm inducing or if it's just just the genetics itself so I decided to go to Amsterdam and acquire us some new blue cheese seats again allegedly from dinafem seats take a good look here good as I can get on this thing you'll notice some leaf kind of tip burnage even though I haven't really given this thing any kind of this is almost pure HP promix it's literally just promix HP with a tiny like maybe a cup full in in a whole big pot not not just this pot so there's a fraction of it but in an entire bin I only put maybe two cups for the vermicompost and and then I put one teaspoon of chai fective plus which is not very hot and it's supposed to have both time release and the water soluble so a good portion of that five I would think would be time release but even then the blue cheese I just even from my experience with growing the other blue cheeses that my patient provider to me it does not want a lot of nutrients and I'm gonna call myself out right now so I don't buy anymore that is definitely not something they want to be growing cannabis with I've was misled by a couple different people that may have had good luck with their strains and whatnot so far I'm going to try to stick to the organics and case you're wondering I'm is also getting ready to plan a bunch of tulips because i do have leftover dirt and i need to do something less so why not plan some tulips because it is you can plant them all the way up until december which we get our good hard frost here and i'm just gonna put him in a big container and throw some drive back to plus on them and see what to tap in the spring so stay tuned for that yeah so I'm just kind of documenting what's going on with the blue cheesier so I'm literally just top feeding this straight up RO water and I'm not going to give it anything i ended up if you notice i end up topping it which i tend to not want to do until I know what I have to begin with this thing up to that point was absolutely not wanting to branch and that's the same sort of traits I've been having with the the clones I have they just end up being a single stock with a couple branches up at the top so I tried to just I made the executive decision to force the top right there and I cut the whole top right off I didn't try to feminize just cut the whole thing off and in and waited and that may have been another reason why it's kind of slow because if you cut recall or if you're watching any my other girl vids you know check check my videos they're all the other videos or are all the other pots were labeled October 15th or there abouts and yet as you can see comparatively this plan has not grown anywhere near as tall as the space monkey and is definitely not as branchy as the blue cheese so there is definitely some genetic differences here and so I just want to document this for the folks at home and myself primarily so I can go back if I need to and get a good look of what it was but we're just gonna let this thing chill out some more I'm gonna look you let it keep growing probably for another month or two at the very least and at the venue I'll minimally get ya so I could get a couple clones off her right now I couldn't even get really a couple closed off off of this lady so and it is a feminized see dats one thing that that might be another troubling factor here because I'm not real experience with them and I see so think they'll do it for today folks give you one last look zoom in see I just a little bit of tip burn off of just hardly any nutrients I don't know how this plane is really because vermicompost only has like a percent or two and i'm certain there was nothing there there's a brand new chrome extreme the disaster that I have going on right there so I'll keep you informed folks see you again next grow log you", "sB6nzuGSRZ4": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] hi guys stopped at me and we're back again have another kind of a strange review what I'm gonna say is thank you to everyone to get M me up to 420 subs I'm over 420 subs now so yeah we're really appreciating that thank you so much it's amazing what everybody's doing for me how it'll go in yeah I'm really appreciating everything thank you to everyone what we're gonna do is we're going to get into the stream gonna let you guys know the smile appearance flavor and buzz and today what we've got is some blue cheese some nice blue cheese so so basically that's the guys wicker if you need anything check out our sponsor make sure you Wicker him and make sure you give him a follow on twitter so i sit on there we did get two grams in here guys we've opened a pack already as you can see we've had one out of it we've tried it last night we wasn't meant to be doing a review last night but didn't get around to doing it because black ops for come out so I was playing nut most of the night but yeah so we're getting to do it now and I was smoking just a normal gram of blue cheese on this last night I was playing black ops and I couldn't play black ops but [ __ ] literally guys so this is very strong very nice indica so if anyone's looking for an indica strain and they're getting off my sponsor basically make sure to get the blue cheese if you're looking for indica this is a really strong indica I will say it up but anyways what we're gonna do is we're gonna get into the smell [Music] [Applause] [Music] hmmm see that this blue cheese is different there's not much smell to it but there's like a more of a sweet smell with that cheesy smile and like earthy piney strong that's what I've always thought blue cheese has meant to be like a sweet sour eat cheese but when people fell in my area give me blue cheese basically they say oh yeah I've got blue cheese wherever you get back and it just stinks of like cheddar cheese like old school cheddar so it's like people rely in a lot of days these days so I'm glad to actually smoke on some actual real blue cheese so yeah it's like a how can I explain that definitely like that the new very smart because you get the fruity notes in this one definitely soon as you break it I'm not going to break any more of that one I want to show you guys start yeah you get the blueberry and you get really like pungent sour cheese you get so perfectly pounding notes and you get like the wood with the fresh berries so it's very nice this this is how blue cheese is very receptive didn't expected but some people get blue cheese and you don't smell the blueberry in out at all and half of the time if you don't smile blue brown is just pure cheese it's mostly cheese so this has definitely got the blueberry in it so blue cheese definitely a strainer I will recommend for anyone that needs Endicott for medicine I'm getting a lot people saying you won't end like pure indica or a lot of high indica for medicine where the other strains are hybrids certain bits like elements will affect me and other elements are affect another person because our bodies are wired differently in our brains and in our bodies so but this is quite a strong Endicott one so uh sponsors been telling us like a lot of it was we're saying on the thing on their videos and they've just been asking for indica so this is more Endicott one won't indicate dominance so - oh yeah I forgot to say basically this strain is from its cheaper side of the menu so this is this is the cheap a lot so buddy's nice really nice to be fair it's not I wouldn't say it should be on the cheap side but it is so that's up to him there's a really nice strain I'm around here if we got something that's smart like this they'd probably call it something else and put it off of fifteen to twenty pound per gram so that's what it's like around Gloucester so it's really nice and definitely scoring out a 10 out of 10 for smell this mild death of me is a is all older what would do is go into the appearance [Music] [Applause] [Music] the appearance we're gonna say this is a gorgeous-looking but it's not as many trichomes as before but you can definitely see this as Endicott because the trichomes are not protruding as much so the indica is definitely there the trichomes against but so it's definitely Endicott but there's definitely a lot of trichomes so don't get me wrong it's not gonna be a weak bud because the trichomes and tall if the stems are tall and stuff like that it's just how long the stems have been growing for stuff like that and then it could be the strain as well so but yeah cuz certain strains were getting certain tricone stems like starting link from the stem and then the bulb would start growing so these ones are quite short but if you had a proper micro lens now we'd be glad to see that the Tri comes properly in its whole form but anyways so the pistils trichomes you got the orange ii yellow with the green so this is really nice really nice what we're gonna do to show you guys this but now it's not the biggest but it's very dense very small your naughty bits but it's really nice right the smile and appearance it's like amazing I'm definitely giving it 10 out of 10 for parents as well I don't know if you guys can actually see that but hopefully you can it does look amazing the but that's like really really small I'm shot like a stop waffling for you guys sorry if I'm whispering it's because like it's quite late as well so anyways that's the appearance there is gonna be some pictures so what we do receive that but there are some pictures put it back in his bag so like I said we're giving a ten out of ten for parents as well densities perfect like there's a little bit of play but not much play mind so put less burden as well for our self letter and that's small a little bit that what you can see here it looks small but that is quite dense so it's probably about a point two point three I will just quickly check on the scales and double-check if you're wondering why scales are they're just around the corner I've got like a table like Amazon that's a three so point to free so he's a nice little bit got two bombs down so what we're doing is were split them into two small bombs and we will grind it so we can have an extra little smell and see what the smile smiles like after being ground because I like doing that as well I like showing people like this yeah there's this smell this smell this smell when you first open it for us crack the bud but then when you grind it there could be extra hidden notes hidden smiles hidden aromas so I like trying to find every and I've noticed on some of my videos I don't look a lot like the camera I'm still learning to concentrate on the cameras because where I'm using a phone the camera is technically the light that's what I'm looking up I'm looking at the light on the phone and it's blinding me half of the time and then I get black dots in my eyes so I need to get myself like a little light once I've got myself a light I won't need to use this light on my phone and I got a static camera a lot more so anyways we've got this so I'm gonna put this up here because we are doing a review but we'll check out that for now so you guys can see our sponsors wicker and Twitter if you need to and we're gonna make a smallest one though just to gain the flavor we don't even pack these ones the small ones we don't even put them down what I mean like packing it is wedging it in so we're just literally didn't like we pack that one and what we're gonna do is gonna tell you guys to flavor I'm gonna say make sure to make you spar for spliff a bomb a DAB it of a eat some edibles take some CBD products toxic me I say c4 the clouds [Music] [Applause] [Music] hmmm that's quite nice you get like a very cheesy resin Piney no straightaway and you've got a little bit of the blueberry taste it's not much blueberry flavor and then there's that like woody fresh no that's really nice flavor it's not the best flavor so this one's only gonna get around about seven for flavor because we're over eight my flavors a lot better than just standard strains so they this is could be classed as a flavor but I would class this as a standard strain myself so it's really nice and the indica it's already kicking in I can feel it already my eyes are going so so yeah I'd give this one a 7 for flavor so it's really nice really very nice so what we're gonna do what we're gonna do is go into the buzz now so I'm gonna start making the bomb already I'm forgetting what I'm saying on this stuff so that shows how strong of in the club it is but when there is screens when there's hybrids in this endicott mixed into them I find if it's not pure indica or high dominance of indica then it's not gonna do the effect that you expect them you're expecting this relaxant and it makes you really high headed don't relax you that much I don't mean like relaxing like CBD or even CBN but if people are looking for or sleep and stuff and stuff anxiety are you see beyond a lot to gain CBN naturally is like decoration and air decoration but sometimes you can speed it up by D carb in what kind of this so now if you put your kind of this in the oven or certain methods of doing it basically a certain degrees if you need help with it obviously asked me on the video and it will turn your bird like orange color it looks so like a brownie orange but it's not burnt it's just slowly activated so you got THC a and you've got THC you've activated it now and turned the THC the psychoactive side of it available in the butt because THC a if you just a kind of this you will not get high yeah so if I add that now I'm not going to feel any effect it's gonna taste nice not gonna be high but I'm not going to get no effect so you've got to activate the THC a to THC and then the THC and the sepia so it goes all the way down so it's like at the end of the day if you want something that's going to help you sleep and like anxiety and stuff like that or depression I find CBN's probly wanted a better ones because you can get any cannabis any cannabis and change the whole compound spectrum to the way it feels even if it's a hybrid indica or even sativa but I've known some sativas that I've turned into CBN be really sedated really really sedate you but before you have to sedate of moments you have like a giggle a high head and then you start having among and sleepy moment so is really hard work for people to try test certain strains and stuff like that so if you don't want to test certain strains make yourself sepia okay strain and try out and smoke it don't eat her yeah what I always do is smoke the CBN so after you think are blue cannabis smoke and try and it is ten times stronger literally ten times stronger not many people will smoke D card cannabis but when I first did my first experiment with the carb cannabis and I thought there could be enough CBN and activated THC in this stuff to get you the medicine you need if you need the information ask me and I will let you know I've been rambling on again too long we're going to go into the buzz now so I just thought I better let people know about that because medicine is a really hard thing to get your hands on and the right medicine especially in this day and age even off the doctor it's not just in kind of this form was even off the doctor like how many times has that people out there like I'm gonna ask everyone this and if you took medication for my depression so anything anxiety schizophrenia I've been off my medication could be for years this year so I was like I've add up medication for four years now okay and I've been using this stuff and it's like they're both technically the same in the aspect of your guinea pig so you're chucking things into a body into a brain and it might not work but on the other hand with this one it's not harming people if they have too much choice not harming people if they don't have the right tablet you know I mean like I've never known anyone to get that depressed off a certain kind of a strain it's got about a time I'm feeling high this is very strong indica like I said he said I can go into the buzz yet so make yourself a spliff a bomb a dab of eight take some THC tubs edibles CBT products anything press pause on one way and I'm going to say see for the clouds we're going to get into the bugs [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh but yeah that was big that's nice if I could give it 20 I could give it 20 but look I gets a 10 out of 10 it's well for buzz so now what we've caught is 10 for smile 10 for appearance 10th buzz and 7 for flavor so we have out of all 10 10 10 7:37 our 40 and this is just a standard strain so now this is really good for standard if you think the jackhammer that was just a little bit groaned if like different it was a little bit bitty and that got 38 so this got 37 just a little bit under the jackhammer and that's a flavor that was just on the low side of the flavors so this is up with the flavours with the strength definitely whoever grew this I will say Fair Play whatever they're doing carry on son buff amazing they grew it properly it tastes like it's been cured properly with humidity packs so you've got to know your right percentage on humidity and cure it properly Bri it's a little kick you get a very resin taste it's not harsh I won't say so harshness more of a kick on the chest the resin but you can tell from definitely definitely definitely tell it's been cured this is a really nice train so make sure to check out our sponsor UK ganja is wicker is the top one and the Twitter is one one so make sure you check him out if you want to try

"jbimzAkUofQ": "[Music] welcome back to another Bammer TV weed reviews today's strain is going to be the much-anticipated cheese strain and just a reminder for you guys if you want to check out some of our other weed reviews go and check out that we'd review playlist link will be in the description but let's get started with today's strain cheese so cheese has been named for its sour sharp aroma and it was a first cross bred in the UK in the late 80s now it has excellent trichome production and is known for increasingly better yields every year and you will definitely know when you have this strain due to like the Dave was saying the signature odor on it there are some other iterations of cheese this is probably the most common that you're gonna find and it's actually one of my favorites it does smoke up really well as you can see here we've chosen a bong as the method just because like we said this just smokes up so much you can see here that a gram of cheese just fills a bowl so this is great if you guys want to do multiple packs and we have a big group of friends this is definitely the strain the sharing is caring with this one most that feeling that from an effects point of view it does help you stay very relaxed and happy and it even has a tendency to make you giggle a little bit like a little schoolgirl so go figure on that one medicinally it's great for pain management and it helps with depression and stress as well yeah and this is just a great weed to bring out if you guys are at a party or get-together definitely brings people a lot closer cheese weed though it kind of goes through you know patches where it is uncommon and then it is common so if you see it you're probably gonna see a lot of it Dave I got to ask you the burning question pun intended aha if you were to give cheese a Bama rating where would this fall on the scale I really like this string I need to I think it I think it hits all the marks for me for top of the line store the one that we had did have a little bit lacking in the flavor Department even though the smell was really really good so even though I really like this train and I want to give it a little bit of a higher rating I'm going to give it a four and a quarter out of five for an order that sounds fair enough and like we said before bong is probably the preferred method this is great bull weed as well just because like we said before it grinds up a ton so you can just have you know sesh after sesh Dave anything any final thoughts on this string I really enjoyed this train as you can see in the video it's very crystal Eve Airy Harry and it looks very unique and that's what I like most about it it's very unique Snow unique look and I think if you see this out in the wild I definitely it's worth at least a quarter of your time that's what I think yeah I mean cheese you can't go wrong with any of the cheese strains so thank you guys very much for watching like I said before if you want to check out some other reviews we do have a we'd review playlist and that will be in the description but for everything else weed and weed related keep it here on Bammer TV [Music]", "o6R5uctWNMs": "hello everybody welcome to callos i'm your host this episode r.i.p and for this episode i want to talk to you guys about the difference between sativa and indica all right but before we dive into this i want you guys to hit the like button and subscribe [Music] sativa is the taller christmas tree shaped plant with much thinner leaves than indica the plant has adapted to grow in hot dry climates so places like las vegas san bernardino riverside tucson phoenix sacramento and fresno are going to be ideal for growing sativa since sativa naturally grows in desert type regions where the days of light are long sativa tend to have a longer flowering cycle now sativa is known for uplifting in cerebrals highs but as we call it in the cannabis world a head high sativa is great for daytime use and doing outdoor activities depending on the strain of sativa it can also help boost your energy and create alertness because the type of high sativa gives you people often claim to be highly focused and productive when smoking sativa now for me if i don't smoke too much too much i'm active and full of life but if i smoke too much my head becomes tired while my body is still fully active in a way now here's some good sativa recommendation hybrid dominant strands right so you got sour diesel green crack super lemon haze jack herer candyland jack the ripper bruce banner train and train wreck and these are just the strands that i personally have tried and know so um there could be more you could have tried strands leave a comment and tell me what kind of strands that you have tried now now let's get into the indica now indica on the other hand indica is the smaller bushier plant with fatter and bigger leaves the plant has adapt has adapted to grow in colder climates so places like san francisco santa barbara san diego seattle oregon are going to be ideal growing areas for indica because indica is smaller and naturally grows in colder places where the light cycle isn't that long indica often times have a shorter flowering cycle now indica is known for heavily sedated full body highs commonly referred to as a body high indica is used for relaxation stress relief and pain relief or pain management depending on how you decide you want to use it because of the type of high that indica produces indica also assists with sleeping as well indica is a couch potato strain that is more recommended to be taken indoors in a relaxing environment than to be taken outdoors in an active environment now for me if i smoke too much anika i'ma go straight to sleep but if i smoke just enough it's gonna make all my aches and my pains go away now here's a recommendation of some indica dominant strains and almost pure indica strains now you got northern lights which everybody knows that that's like the founder of almost all the strains then you got critical purple kush you got bubbles kush hindu kush bubba's gift granddaddy purple blue cheese and kosher kush and more popular indica strains out there but these are just some of the indica strains that i have tried in the past now if you guys find this video useful please hit the like button to subscribe alright thank you guys", "TyuAC616qCM": "[Music] how's it going YouTube I'm always placing here back with another video today is going to be a strain review and for review today we actually have some wedding cake so without further ado as you guys can see I'm in nature here actually just in a little forest near my house so hopefully you guys enjoyed the scenery today but anyways let's get right into the review it is wedding cake so obviously we're gonna give you the genetics of wedding cake which is Girl Scout cookies crossed with a cherry pie so that's what makes a wedding cake and let's jump right into this review basically wedding cake was bred by cookie fam genetics they bred all those famous hype strains like Girl Scout cookies gelato and a bunch of other stuff so yeah without further ado I can't give you guys the looks of these buds because I don't have a nut I will show a lot of pictures at the end of the video so I'll give you the smell of this wedding cake which is something very very unique it has like a very just dank doughy vanilla cookie scent in my opinion it's like really really really good it's very hard to describe when you crack open the jar it's kind of like a doughy vanilla just dank muskiness that just hits your nose it almost smells like when you're baking cookies or like croissants or something like it's really crazy but yeah so I'm gonna give you guys basically the looks on the looks of these buds were just dense frosty just rock-hard just amazing beautiful nugs I'm gonna show you guys all the screen shot at the end of the video a quick tip for you guys if you guys want to learn how to light a joint properly this is my way of doing it you obviously want to get the end lit get a cherry going and then just spark it up all right so as you guys can see this joint is burning nice and white the ash this cannabis was flushed very well the grower is actually fat farm craft cannabis Co I'll put the link in the description and you guys can check out his Instagram an amazing amazing grower he actually grew this zombie curse that I reviewed not too long ago but let's get back to the review for the wedding cake so as soon as you pull this it has like thick dense milky smoke but the flavor is like I said it's a doughy vanilla kind of cushiness like it's it's very unique I've never had a strain that tastes like this or smells like this it almost has like like a baked goods kind of reminiscent taste that just coats your mouth like I said very vanilla a very musky dankey cookie just overall an amazing amazing strain another thing I want to let you guys know as you guys can see I'm wearing my portugal jersey let me know who you guys are going for in the World Cup it's been an amazing tournament so far and I can't wait to see who wins I have a feeling it's gonna be an underdog team but we'll see but yeah good luck to your team in World Cup as well let me know who you guys are cheering for in the comments as you guys can see nice white ash beautiful color nice resin ring going right around the joint it won't be able to focus sorry guys I'm using the front-facing camera I actually have my phone lodged on a like a broken tree branch right now so that's how I'm filming this going woo but for the effects of wedding-cake it is a very very very nice hybrid strain it's an indica dominant hybrid I would probably say an 80/20 75 15 or 75 25 kind of like something like that very very heavy just hit you right behind the eyes you just start getting very relaxed and mellow and just stress-free and it's just an amazing amazing full body relaxation no pain in your body like I said if you had any depression or anxiety it would just completely wipe it away and just coat you with an amazing feeling of just being uplifted and happy and just in a good mood and like you know an overall good enjoyable high but at the same time like you're stoned - it's really nice Wow another person's walking by right now so just might see a dog or something in the video yeah I'm kind of in like it's kind of like a ravine kind of path or bike path kind of thing it's not really like a forest or like a park it's kind of a weird area but either way who gives a [ __ ] I'm just smoking a joint anyways if you guys didn't know kind of Canada actually legalized cannabis and it's going to be coming October 17 2018 so go canada baby so I'm gonna get into the ratings out of ten for this wedding cake for the looks out of ten this is a very very nice-looking bud big frosty dense nugs I would have to say out of ten I would say in 8.5 out of 10 very beautiful nugs frosty dense smelly sticky so that's for the looks the smell the smell is also an eight and a half out of ten it's not the best smelling strain in the world but it's very unique and it's almost kind of like one of those dessert kind of strains that you smoke after dinner right before you hit bed or you know just when you're chilling watching a movie it's kind of like a treat when you smoke a joint of wedding cake like how it makes you feel it's so amazing so that's for the looks for the smell is also an 8.5 out of 10 look smell taste the taste comes through exactly like the smell it has that vanilla doughy cushion muskiness that just coats your mouth and just sits there I would have to say it's pretty unique there's not a lot of strains that taste like this there's a few maybe cookie strains that might have that dough anus in there so for the taste I would also have to give it an 8.5 out of 10 what else can I say look smell taste the effects the effects of wedding cake are in my opinion really really really good for an indica dominant hybrid it's exactly what I want I'm clear-headed I'm able to speak properly without stuttering without feeling foggy but at the same time I'm very relaxed and like very stoned and you know very mellow right so it's an amazing feeling I don't think you can really get better than that for indica hybrid effects in my opinion a great daytime smoke and nighttime smoke whenever you want you can even wake and bake if you actually want to I won't really put you right to bed but yeah overall for wedding cake I'm gonna have to give it a solid 8.5 out of 10 it's just that a really well-balanced strain it hits all the marks looks smell tasting effects it's really dank you know the Terps are there so in my opinion it's a very solid strain make sure you guys can get a verified cut of wedding cake if you guys are looking to pick this up so yeah this has been I'm always blazing's review of wedding cake hopefully you guys enjoyed it and I'll see you guys in the next video have a bake day guys [Music] [Music]", "S8Cy58tQTAc": "I'll get I could no it's today we're making same on cell I believe that's how you pronounce it now same on cell is a hard blue cheese which I was very surprised to find in one of my recipe books I modified it down to using ten liters or eleven litres of milk it is because I added in some goat's milk to some cow's milk to give it a little bit of zing it helps from France originally this is not the AOC version of Sam Massell anyway let's get on with the method of how to make Simon sell so for this cheese you need eleven litres of milk so I used five liters of full cream or whole milk which was about three point eight percent i used five liters of light milk or skim milk which is about one percent and a liter of goat's milk now sanitized all my gear beforehand and to that I added these ingredients so ten liters or partly skim milk so that was the combination of the two lots of five liters and then one liter or one quart of whole goat's milk which have been pasteurized as well an eighth of a teaspoon of mesophilic starter culture one sixteenth of a teaspoon of penicillin broke 43 point two five milliliters or five eighths of a teaspoon of calcium chloride that's been diluted in 60 milliliters of cool non-chlorinated water three point two five milliliters will 5 eighths of a teaspoon of liquid rennet which has been diluted in 60 milliliters of non-chlorinated water and 2 tablespoons of non-iodized salt so don't forget to if you have any fat globules on top just mix those in if it's thicker cream and then pop the thermometer on the side of your pot so they yes starting temperature of the milk should be 29 degrees Celsius or 85 degrees Fahrenheit it's nearly there are my thermapen just stirring that so the temperature is read evenly okay [Music] so whilst I was hitting the milk up I was made sure that I'd combined the three types of milks that I used by steering it quite well during the heating period now I'm gonna add the mesophilic starter culture and Penicillium broke for tea at the same time I've got a sachet that has both in it so they're the right quantities of the mesophilic starter culture and the pendulum wrote for tea just in that single sachet there so sprinkle that all over the top of the milk if you just had the both cultures separately this is the time you add them both anyway since making sure I get all of it out of the satio there now even though it looks orange at the moment the blue mold one up rehydrates you'll see oh she turns a little bit bluey green magic of of cheese making I suppose okay we're going to allow those to rehydrate now for five minutes [Music] so five minutes later so uncover it and we'll give it a good stir now you may also notice at this stage that you've got some fat sitting on the top from any cream that couldn't be re incorporated into the milk this has now become cultured butter basically and if it persists before pressing then you have to get rid of it okay I'm going to add the calcium chloride solution now give that a good stir in and then I'm going to add in the rennet so I'm using single strength rennet here which is I MCU 200 between 200 and 280 so this is 200 Renan I'm using here [Music] now notice there was no ripening period for this so it's not a highly acidic cheese okay so I've stood that for no more than one minute and just let that stop I'm going to cover that up I'm gonna allow it to sit for one hour and 30 minutes at the target temperature this is because the milk hasn't acidified so it's going to take longer for the rennet to set okay now the time is elapsed for the coagulation we're going to check for a clean break that doesn't look too bad so we're going to cut the curds now into one point two five centimeter or half inch cubes it was quite solid there had a little bit difficulty getting the curd Harpe through that then and then just make make the remaining cuts with your curd knife now I did see the other day somebody was using a steel ruler which would be perfectly fine if you sanitized it before you used it for cheese making [Music] it never ceases to amaze me how ingenious cheese makers are when they're coming up with the different types of equipment to make their cheese with okay we cover that back up again and we're gonna let the cubes of curd heal for five minutes okay five minutes lady and see a fair bit of the way has been expelled there and we're gonna gently stir the curds for ten minutes only so it's still at the target temperature we don't heat the milk up any further it just stays at this temperature now if you need to reheat it a little bit then make sure you just check the temperature quite often of the curds now you can see there that I'm just gently lifting the curds at this initial stage I'm a steam to be a little bit fragile what you can do also if you see any large lumps of curd there that you can cut it with a side of your stirring spoon so that's after the ten minutes of stirring you can see the curds have shrunk quite a bit Russ to one or two large pieces there that I keep spotting every now and then but a lot of whey has been expelled from the curds which is a good sign that you're on the right track [Music] okay we're gonna allow the Kurds to settle now as they sink to the bottom so cover your pot and roulette and then we're going to wait for ten minutes [Music] so ten minutes later you can see that there aren't any Kurds visible there so we're gonna remove the way down to the level of the Kurds so this is a little bit like a like a washed curd cheese but you'll see the difference in a minute is a slight variation here so remove the way this may take some time you can see that I'm using a sieve there just so I can get all that way out as quick as I can without actually getting any curds in the ladle so that works very well so we'll let that settle out sorry we're not without - we're gonna stir the curds for 10 minutes so this will help but expel some more way as well [Music] so 10 minutes later you can see that the Kurds have shrunk again that's a little bit of that butter fat I was talking about before but I've just scooped off the cultured butter okay we're gonna put the lid back on and we're gonna allow to settle for another ten minutes [Music] so ten minutes later you can see that the Kurds have sunk back down again and there's some way there and wait all that off with the use of my ladle and my sieve [Music] quite amazing how much way actually gets expelled during these 10 minutes during times so I'm going to gently stir again for another 10 minutes now you'll find that you struggle a little bit here because there's not a lot of liquid to it to stir through and you can see there that they shrunk again they've expelled a bit away but there's not a lot of way there there we go there's 2 4 10 minutes [Music] okay we're gonna cover that up and we're gonna allow that to sit for another ten minutes should asked so the code whatever could and why you can settle it up so we can do a little bit of a test here we're gonna take a handful of the curd and we're gonna lightly squeeze it together and if it stays in a ball and then breaks easily apart with your thumb then it's ready to proceed to draining so that's quite good there I was quite happy with the curd it mix it together alright now if it doesn't hold together then stir for about another five to ten minutes and then test it again okay we're gonna drain it through a cheesecloth line colander and in fact it's not a lot to drain out really there's a tool in the other pot which you could use that that way for all manner of things from feeding your garden any acid loving plants love away any livestock you can use it to make sourdough bread you can use it in the place of buttermilk for pancakes all sorts of things you can do with why make it into a smoothie it tastes very nice as well okay we're going to allow the curds now to drain for fifteen minutes [Music] okie-dokie say I had did have those covered with the lead from the same pot I was using just happens to fit into my colander quite well I'm just gonna bundle up the cheesecloth and basically I there was a bit too much way in there as I could tell it wasn't gonna fit into the mold so maybe I should have let it for it drain for about another 10 minutes anyway so I Jen and gently just moved the bag around a little bit and away came out under its own pressure I didn't squeeze it or anything like that you can see didn't quite fit there just a little bit more yeah and then I tested it most of the weight was gone which was good and now it's gonna fit into the mold perfect okay so put the follower on top and then put it into your cheese press we're gonna press it about five kilograms which is 11 pounds for about one hour I've got a spring press you may have to retighten it because it shrinks quite a bit during this initial one hour pressing [Music] okay so one hour later and I remove it from the press and we're gonna take it a mold now be gentle it is staged hasn't quite formed completely just gently turning that over and I'm gonna press that again at ten kilograms or 22 pounds for 12 hours so that's about half my spring compressed is about 10 kilograms for mine so 12 hours later same thing again removed from the cheese press and take it out of the mold that's formed up a lot better this time you may get some little bits on the top but just turn those over the oddest incorporate back on the cheese and we pop it back in the press same weight so 10 kilograms or 22 pounds for another 12 hours [Music] there we go [Music] so twelve hours later I'm going to remove the cheese from the press again take it out of the mold and this is where we're gonna do the salting so this cheese doesn't get brined it gets dry salted over the surface of the cheese [Music] now I should have measured in the box first but anyway we'll see a little bit of them a little later place it on a clean mat and you're gonna sprinkle 1 teaspoon of salt on top of the cheese and then rub it in so this is non-iodized salt okay and we're gonna wait two hours for the salt to absorb it supposed to be able to cover it but got a bit of an issue there the lid won't go on so what I do midstream using the same mat I basically just put it into a big container there we go now these mats were sanitized cleaning the dishwasher and then sprayed with vinegar beforehand okay so after the two hours what I'm spraying my hand there is just white vinegar so when I touch the cheese I'm not transferring any yeasts or molds to it so anyway that's in the containers are trying that out turn the cheese over and then sprinkle another teaspoon of salt on the other side of the cheese which at the top now and rub that in go pop it back into the container pop the lid on so leave that overnight now at room temperature so the next morning we can drain anyway again [Music] and we're gonna turn the cheese and we're gonna salt repeat the salting period so I did it all in one piece here so you can actually wait the two hours but I had to go to work so I didn't have that option so then leave for another 12 hours or overnight so now we're gonna ripen it at 10 degrees Celsius or 50 Fahrenheit at 90 degrees relative humidity turn the cheese daily for the first two weeks then after two weeks you'll should see a blue mold bloom all over it and what we're gonna do now is Pierce the cheese so in a piece of cheese all the way through in multiple places horizontally and vertically n-- skewer or you can use a thermometer i've seen some people use drill bits sanitized drill bits because it has a clean hole and the what we're trying to encourage here is the blue mold to grow into the cheese so i go a bit crazy with the holes more holes of better i reck'n seems to work out quite well [Music] and then on the bottom side Saunders pushing down til I hit the plastic basically okay so we're going to continue to ripen that at 10 Celsius 50 Fahrenheit 90 percent relative humidity for another two weeks and turning that daily so after four weeks they seem to get a little bit of an orange II blue on it so you lower the humidity by leaving the lid off a little bit down to 80 percent our register leaf relative humidity I'll be right on that for another three to four weeks turning it twice weekly so not turning as often because there's not as much way to be expelled so not much moisture collects on the bottom of the ripening box you can see it in all its glory there so after a total of eight weeks of maturation then you wrap it in foil so I'm using aluminium foil here basically wrapping it up it's putting one layer on and then a second layer so it doesn't leak out if any why he does leak out into my cheese fridge so you can store it in the kitchen fridge up to four months or for a strut for a strong cheese from my older one you can store it for a lot less and probably eat it about now well they have occurred nerds their same on cell all wrapped in its foil I'll be tasting this on the 10th of March or there abouts it was a fairly easy cheese to make once I figured out the steps but wasn't it a delight to see a blue cheese that wasn't simply pressed under its own weight it was really good fun to have an actual press involved to see how this cheese develops now what I'm going to be interested to see is how are the veins going to develop during the maturation period so I've been turning this one weekly just to make sure that's even distribution of the fats and all that sort of funky stuff but it's going to be very interesting to see how far the blue is actually gone into the cheese and if not it'll still taste like a blue cheese anyway with the addition of the Penicillium broke for tea anyway thanks for watching Kurd nerds if you want to see a more interesting cheesy content don't forget to

going to be taking a look uh checking out and seeing what we think guys i'll catch you in the next part of the video please easy now guys okay so we're back for another stream review uh we're going to be taking a look at a company called top shelf cbd uh the extra strain coming in at 20 cbd pretty sure most people would have heard about unknown about the excellence strain more commonly known as cheese or uk cheese straight off the back quite dense bit of stick in this thing orange and brown hairs sort of embedded into the pot cracking one open that's when you get your cheese smell definitely it's a bit of blueberry now as well so i think it's going to be more along the lines of uh blue cheese i will find that you guys down a bit all right so obviously yeah like i said a lot of people would have known about or had a bit of cheese at some point in their time so i originally came out and saw the late 1980s uh 90s sensei scenes snuck number one british breeders exodus uh if you don't know about exodus obviously you've got the uh exodus collective in sort of like the late 80s 90s um that basically came together as like sort of community um you know sort of trying to stand for uh legalization of sort of cannabis and also they built a community for like um themselves and obviously anyone who needs it like homeless people and they actually had a farm um they put on a lot of uh sort of like raves as well um all of this was obviously met with a lot of negative press by the government and also the police um so yeah once again guys uh kimono coming together to stand for something they believe in to benefit sort of like everyone and then obviously you're going to get the government and the police involved and they're going to take a negative stance to it which is a shame do not mean to monitor yet but that's usually how things go um you can actually uh google online um excellence collective and also there's quite a few uh youtube videos out there as well um a couple of documentaries and there's also some like raw footage of uh some of their raves from back in the days which is uh pretty cool to watch all right so back to the strain yeah it's got that cheesy smell to it but stick in this thing yeah once it's ground up that's when you get the smell coming through and yeah it smells smells a bit like uh blue cheese guys this one looks like when it's ground up i'm really open the uh the flavor notes come through on this one nice and fluffy so so device yeah so this one's 60 indica 40 sativa it's a hybrid supposed to be uh relaxing euphoric and motivated good for depression and pain all right time again guys grab your beverage of choice and today we're going for a nice cbd infused elderly everyone out there is doing all right drawing the weather my last couple of days has been really nice i've got my tree once again she wants those yep it's there that classic blue cheese it's not as full on obviously as the thc strain but the taste is down so you got a mixture of sort of like the cheesy and also like a hint of blueberry and on this one the blueberry that that's actually coming through more thanks be honest with you guys i've actually been there waiting for a uh a nice example of a cheese strain and uh back in the day blue cheese is almost almost my favorite go-to sort of strength um so to get this um you know i thought it was going to be cheese but that it's more along the lines of uh blue cheese to be honest with you so yeah massive shouts out to uh topshop cbd for this one definitely gets my thumbs up over the ash test really clean it's really smooth as well and that flavor really does linger in your mouth i'm really amazed at this one stinky one as well it's like i was saying earlier obviously exodus is the exodus collective there's a massive amount of history there guys um like i said if you type into google extroverts collective or even on youtube check out some of their documentaries and their videos and they really were a really good organisation group and set out to try and accomplish something uh potentially that you know would be really amazing and great but sadly you know the government please got involved and you know it really didn't have to be that way you know it's pretty sad to go to sugar but yes not only did this one have a lovely aroma taste is most important for me and this one tips all the boxes great aroma great taste clean smoke yeah so uh top shelf cbd massive thumbs up for this one i'm definitely going to be checking out some more new products gassy cheesy and the

YouTube welcome to day 144 from seed and today I plan on harvesting this plant but before I do I just wanted to show you how she's looking and I probably could have let this plant go another another week maybe longer but looking at the trichomes they're looking pretty good and this is around the time frame that this specific plant was supposed to flower so I decided today would be the day and she's actually looking pretty frosty just looking through this video but this is the plant this is actually the plant that I've had the most difficulty with so that's a little bit surprising but I just wanted to show you she's actually looking really pretty from the through the lens of my camera", "6z3QJhG_1js": "yo sup Jimmy Maloney hit you guys with small brief reviews today I'll shut us up our good friends at THC collection and today we are gonna hit you guys with the super cheese which is an indica dominant hybrid it ranges between 20 to 24% THC and of course as always Drupal a when we're dealing with our friends at THC collection there we go we actually got the focus for once look at that [Music] because it helps me clean the camera lens right there we go now we back I already look [ __ ] stoned Idol idol 890 last night so don't mind me hopefully I can still review the herb properly you know I shouldn't be a problem this is the super cheese here I'm a little plugged up so to be honest there's not very strong smell um it is kind of cheesy though I'm not gonna lie like it is kind of it almost kind of has like a faint smell of Cheetos which they got the cheeto guy on there so that's a you know that's a suiting image for it yeah I apologize my my muting systems down a little bit today my nostrils are nothing plugged up all day so probably even hear my voice a bit but okay now that I break it up and smelly it does have a faint cheesy smell to it though oh [ __ ] I should have showed you guys the bug before I broke it apart [ __ ] I wish I cleaned this lens long ago man this is [ __ ] so much easier you can actually see what I'm showing you now posing me taking pictures and [ __ ] and cropping them in that speak too soon so it's a nice bud you know it's not overly covered in Krystal or anything like that but it looks good smells nice it does have a it does have a cheesy smell to it and I'm trying to put put my finger on the rest of it arm it's it's really hard right now with my own with my nachos clogged up um you know got your typical weed smell doesn't smell like anything that's gonna whoop my ass or anything like that I mean this is that high percentage though and uh you know indica dominant hybrid so well we'll see what it actually does to me here but yeah it smells good like it's got like a very very fit it's in a bit of a cheesy smell [Music] and like just kind of hard to put my finger on it right now I'm sorry guys it's easier when um I can actually smell properly so I don't want to mislead you so my apologies but it does have a cheesy smell to it and anyway so we're gonna get that rolled up smoke that up and today we're going with the grape flavor high tea blunts you know me I like my high teas so that's what we'll be rolling with and yeah let's pop it in the grinder and let's see how this goes [Music] all right upon grinding it up I just wanted to follow up with you guys cuz um smells a lot more pungent now it's got a very piney smell to it but I couldn't catch that so much off riff but once you grind it up it does have a very very piney smell to it see if I can get you guys an inside look I know what it such what you're looking at very very almost lime greenish type of color almost like it like you could tell it was cured properly like it's not too dry it's got almost like a a bit of a almost almost overly moist texture though when you actually have the bud itself it's got like a perfect moisture to it I'll say I'm actually I suck at drawing weed so when I said the weed I smoked on a regular basis the [ __ ] that you know the homegrown it's very dry so I bust it up and it's almost you got you got to be careful you give it a couple pulls or else you turn it to powder um so this actually has a lot more of moist texture I'm gonna have to be careful and make sure what I roll the blunt I don't roll it too tight or it might not hit properly but it's almost like almost cured perfectly I would say for like what we're looking for as a weed connoisseur I personally perform I should drive but you know um it's not the best way when you're you know consume that that's not that's not the ideal way to have your weed you know what I mean especially regardless of your selling it buying it whatever it is it all crumbles on you in terms the [ __ ] powder all that nonsense either way seems like it's cured perfectly just wanna update you guys very piney smell we don't get into it [Music] you're going on the surf get the size ballon gets a toe pad [ __ ] I'm getting stung for my breath blow SATs so much with the hopes a bullish dress but I still feel as low as this roach again just part of the process now I even do coke glasses cuz there's never been a single time that I don't sketch yeah and my thongs telling me that I should smoke less before my whole chest explode you won't last for the smoke and champ token plans got me flowing like a pro and they're like a bunch like a postal stamp when the dope is jammed and the cigar that's a mold in my hand that's much cuz the drove is there my loans loan to roll a gram and leave nothing but snails moment of am so high my eyes close to the jams will awake up in and out with the Easter's burn hole in my pan come wit your house getting drunk out club in Hawaii I don't care what sorry about the quality change here you know can't smoke in the station there's a reason why I can't smoke with my trip no more inside so you got your smoking outside there anyways so on my apologies like I said on the change of quality here let's go [Music] [Music] whoa I'm expected to hit like that just punch and once it hits the muzzle it's got a tough flick like tough rough going down [Music] whoa I wonder as well to maybe ask you my name system just being a little bit down today my nose been running shipment ship it's not a good flavor though the pond flavour translates overtop the flavor the blunt good a great flavor plum but I can taste the UH the pine eNOS over top the cheese smell doesn't translate like the bud itself smells a little bit cheesy born she actually busted off you get a really strong pine smell and that's translated into the smokiness Wall Street which I kind of figured it would but but I'm not gonna say creeper Sam given enough time but I will say um it's like it's a good way to word it not like a silent killer not not quite what I'm trying to say but like off riff by looking at it I wasn't expecting the weed that was actually gonna be this potent and I'm like I can already feel it like I'm already starting to feel a little bit buzzed I'm actually really hoping though Mike stone gets here with the beer soon so I could have cracked a couple you know before we start our podcast be a little bit more you know chill cuz I can just tell off this I'm not gonna be very conversational for a podcast is that kind of weird I get already feeling whoa [Applause] well you know what they say don't judge a book by it's cover and this meat is good example of that I'm telling you off rip cheesy smell just a look at the bottom like I assumed it to be you know one of those you know average like like yeah I get me high and [ __ ] but like you know I'm not gonna be [ __ ] wreck like a wood off like maybe like purple crack or something right which lookout we're doing a purple crack view next but all this is strong I can you smoke much more than its really harsh going in this is really good this might be the bud out of everything we tried on here so far that I'm most surprised with as far as some you know even just packaging you know what I mean like the look of like the cheeto guy doesn't it doesn't it doesn't set you off though the image that I'm about to get [ __ ] rap when it's kind of more like a mellow vibe almost I don't know why you wanted me but that's just kind of how I seen it and then break it open look at the bud yeah you know now overly crystal he doesn't look like a [ __ ] you know diamond listening you know what I mean like you know he does some crystal in Italy you know just kind of like a dense almost hydro inch but a little better than high Jewish looking but if you know what I mean like you know when I say hydro New Age smokers ride no idea what I'm talking about but me when I was coming up used to buy weed from dudes and it would just be called hydro much as men is it was like hydroponic indoor grown wheat that was grown in masses and you know not cured properly not cared about that's kind of what this looked like but like the good stuff you'd get we'd

stone um yeah I'm not gonna call it a creeper I can't think uh what's the word I'm looking for man got me - hi - even though think what I'm trying to say but basically in in short form what I'm trying to say is looks can be deceiving and this one is a deceiving one so it's good I would highly suggest it especially if you're looking to get high high and when you smoke it don't expect it to be as mellow as the scent of it is that cheesy scent they gotta be nice and smooth it's it's actually pretty harsh and it gets your [ __ ] rep THC collection calm make sure you check them out www THC

good day", "D46FS80iiL4": "hello reefer crew and welcome to smokin pot with Steve today we're going to talk about the top 12 pots trained to help people who suffer from PTSD I've reviewed around 60 strains in the last six months and these ones are the top 12 that claim that they help in some kind of fashion so I'll give you all 12 and I have created a playlist I've done full reviews on every one of these strains and I'll create a playlist that you can go through and take a look at each of the strains and see what sounds like the kind of strain you're interested in like if you're looking for an indica purine because you know cuz you want something that will help you sleep at night or if you're looking for something that you can stay up so you're looking for you know a sativa or a balanced I'll talk of you know talk about the mix is a different in each of them each of the videos I talked about that what they do so I'll just go through the list right now just so you have an overview like I'm working from the lowest THC to this highest so from the weakest to the strongest so you figure out where you want to be on that list chem dog is number 12 on the list since 55% in dakar its THC is 19% it's that's a nice strain it's a very light light stone next is number 11 is hash plant which is 80% indica and again it's THC is 13 to 19 percent it's a pretty light stone good for people who don't smoke a lot of pot number 10 on the list is blue cheese it's an 8% into car and the THC is a 20% and what I Norris thought blue cheese is it makes you hungry so if you're having a problem with loss of appetite at the same time my help number nine Alyssa's God button it's 5050 indica sativa and the THC is 15 to 20% and I noticed when I was smoking bought the gods but that I really did salon me old a lot I just got daydreaming that if I find myself just daydreaming and so I kind of liked it Ashley number eight is cheese it's 5050 and the THC is 15 to 20% has CBD of 1% and this one's the real meltdown at the end of the day kind of plot so if you wanna get on the coaching you just want to stay there this is really good for that Nexus had headband and it's a 60% indica and THC 17 to 24 percent so now we're getting up into the more powerful zones of the pop range and headband was very I was very creative on that pot and it was fun it was a fun pop to smoke Romulan is a hundred percent indica and it's 20 to 24 percent raw melon will put you to sleep it's my favorite pot to smoke just before I go to bed puts you up like a lighting really nice for that Cinderella 99 it's 85 percent sativa and a THC of 25 percent this has been a real favorite of mine for years years it's a really good pot for going out partying number four on the list is pineapple Express it's a 60% sativa a THC of 25 percent and it's a pretty good stone yeah I'd say it's a nice stone number 3 on the list is Sour Diesel it's 9% sativa THC of 19 to 25 percent and it's a really fun party pot this is a strong pump number two on the list is white widow which is sixty percent in indica and THC of 20 to 25 percent it's great pot and leaves me happy and relaxed and number one on the list is Girl Scout cookies which is 60% sativa at THC of 17 to 28 percent and it's killer pot so now I can now you get out overview go ahead and watch them look at the videos in the playlist and narrow down what you're really looking for and really hope this helps until next time", "xAnjUVebdIM": "okay we're smoking uk cheese from cloud cover cannabis uh cloud cover cannabis has a farm or farms in oregon and

originally bred it um just inbred skunk number one until they got a fino that they really liked and that happened to be uk cheese and it's it's good i thoroughly enjoy uk cheese let's let's get a look at it these nugs are like super dense little like pebble rock size i really like the green on these and the smell is fantastic the product appeal the presentation the downside of oregon is as we've heard before is they don't you brand your jars so you don't you can't get the unique branding or the unique images that draw your eye to the product on the shelves like you can in washington and california so oregon's like a downside for that but just like in a jar like this this [ __ ] looks good i thoroughly enjoy it so i gave it an 86 for presentation at 84 for product appeal for color because of the green shade i gave it an 89 i think the color is really well done on these uh smell i gave it an 88 i really enjoy the cheese and chocolatey combination that you get from both of these i think that's a phenomenal blend of flavors got an 88 again for tastes because that chocolaty smell and taste or smell really comes in through with these i give it a 88 for potency give it an 85 for experience or didn't have me like completely couchshot but i was definitely it was a good way to spend an evening and i i smoked a lot of this while i was just like sitting around a campfire so it was very relaxing and enjoyable so it was good uh info i gave it an 80. uh cloud cover has a lot of information on their other strains and other products that they have but i could not find anything on their website about uk cheese they just provide an overview of every single one of these strains that they grow so it's like a strain library i gave it a 90 for what i recommend and overall i gave it

seven of flowering that's seven weeks 49 days of 12 12 under the spider farmer sf 2000 for these three budding beasts okay right week seven no less as important as week six but of course week six comes first so you've gotta get through that and you gotta follow those key little you know steps that i've showed you in episode in the previous three episodes you're really sure to scroll back to at least episode 13 if you're just tuning in right because this is the week when we solidify all those games okay so we're going to start off right here in the front with our chewy cheese which is the greenhouse seeds cheese crust with the lemon wookie glue and this one folks is getting oh so frosty this week also fair bit of color maturation of the buds check we've got quite a bit of orange to red fiery looking frosty pistols and quite a bulbous cola i'd say overall pretty much above our average board production looking very tasty indeed and lest we forget i just have to take my word from this perhaps the loudest one in the growth hint this one absolutely reeks and what a mixture it is we got like a real vibrant fuel flavor that right there that's absolutely unmistakable but we also have that kind of musky earthiness of the cheese coming through there as well so that one's a real stinker very nice okay now moving along i guess check it out must be like the effects of a remote influencer i've been wishing for things to turn purple this year we got hints of it there nothing to write home about but weren't mentioned nonetheless with our bulbous cola super skunk looking very tasty and surrounded by a crown of pretty much golf ball sized side top boards they're looking very nice again that's the result the minimalist pruning there a little lollipop didn't do an absolutely perfect job you see a few stragglers here and there but you got to just light bit of pruning trim it away shading fan leaves for our tree just you know to develop that lateral growth nicely and then last but not least right the jewel in the corner the growth hand get a load of this colossal cola this one's the showstopper the trophy cola indeed an incredibly frosty as well just all around star performer really can't wait to smoke this get a load of this is the double baked cheesecake and this one yeah it's getting oh so frosty as well this week super dense boards just looking absolutely perfect and like an absolute little bud machine phenomenal flare to leaf ratio right the way around just overall fantastic yeah love it all three of them in fact very pleased with it looks like on track for quite a nice harvest now just to round things off keep consistency with your environmental controls is key here that's why we go back to our thermal hygrometer which is just about still working for me right so you can see there 24.7 degrees celsius 54 relative humidity okay and we're probably going to go down as low as about 50 relative humidity in the final week which i reckon is going to be week 8 so get ready for the grand finale coming up next folks this one's the penultimate episode so if you like what you see folks you want to support the show directly you can sign up and

now yeah so this update is day 70 on this grow and I should be taking down the little birdie today but we're gonna leave them for an extra 47 days just wanna flush mine extra little bit and because of a simple crop and just give them an extra couple of days as you can see everything is looking sweet the smaller plants but let's go through them here this one the one next to one this one here and just one here they're the four blue cheese and the slightly bigger ones I mean slightly bigger tail the blueberries you can see the blueberry really got off yeah so as I said Liberty I'm gonna leave for another seven days for it to $7 flushing and then tighten down the blue cheese is a 70 take you they strained so [ __ ] nobody vote on this bill ready this time rap I'm doing with the playoffs no I can't tell you what the smell is like oh they're definitely the this one here is a blue cheese don't be formation on boards are rock solid blue bird you have to back this ones there because the super coffins at least a week behind the rest blue cheese here because it's a super everything looking great yeah stop feeding them now about seven days ago so everything in here is on the flush at the moment blueberry and as you can see in the background it really got all those plants are about four foot tall as you can see and get some nice border from the blue cheese these are there from the seed expert compared to the blue cheese I grew up on the last girl where which we're doing the same [ __ ] say it's DC's seems to be a lot stronger not better easier to grow better both for him okay board formation and keep our board yes so when as I say I'm gonna leave everything there for another five seven days and then I'll do a video when I take down the blueberry push to the blue cheese where you underneath Deloitte's for the last few days give them an extra bit yeah what I'm actually gonna do is I'm going to flush one of the I got two staff plus some of these blueberries with water and sugar today and flush the rest to keep continue flushing the recipe just straight tap off just to see what the difference is see if the Troy calms pop on it with the one with the sugar in it make up some of this blueberry both well yeah and I also just want to give a quick shout out to everyone that has sold me picked up a few new Sobers in the last couple of weeks so they say thank you very

cannabis I know it's nighttime what I'm shooting this early in the morning sleep is for the weak hmm no coffee no a spliff look cause I've been hmm about stations all week and it's absolutely paid off now it's time to show you guys the final four plants we've got your last look at the most purple cush you're ever gonna see and some two superstars sativas okay let's get through with folks here we grow hmm it's been a very very busy week fortunately there hasn't been any rains hasn't been any terrible thunderstorms but nevertheless - at the ready and I've been keeping unusual hours I've also been busy harvesting a couple of plants so let's pick up with blue coach berry the most purple specimen of the bunch and it is safe to say that this girl is incredibly dank and incredibly close to harvest get a load of these boards oh my god maximum frosted maximum purple tones and those beautiful orange hairs oh yes oh yes okay this week I promise is gonna show you my jeweler's loupe but I just couldn't figure out how to you know get a good angle with on the cameras I can't really zoom in any better on these trichomes than with the with the video camera or something I'm trying to get in under what you can see look it's totally frosted and I'm trying to hold a napkin in there at the error all on this particular plant completely milky had a try comes now I just I'll show you the actual jeweler's loupe in one of the smoke reports or maybe just in the next episode before we wrap it up so you know when I'm talking my book pocket microscope whatever you use was that is all you need you know to really get in there but at the same time you know your quarterly ball I'm gonna be honest with you because I've never come that's of course had so many so much frost that's how many orange airs and within at the end of week age and you know that wasn't dawn so this girl is absolutely ready to go so I've been just flushing it with the five milliliters per liter of coconut water and we'll just take it down here we have a look and the medium is not quite dry so I'm gonna clip her tomorrow wit her sister that has also produced some purple tones now not quite so rich the developments but get a load of these notes oh yes indeed you stuff so just a sugary and just as ripe and ready for harvest too so just a pullback week that Blue Crush Berry is a really killer strain that's one for definite I'll be growing this again pleasure to grow out of the whole lot of the easiest to grow most suitable in my opinion to the environment and the climatic conditions and definitely responded really really well to my experimental organic nutrient regime does it go admit last year was all about you know using the minimal amount of Canada synthetic a typical indoor nutrients and applying what I knew there outside this year starting off with the auto flaring plans you seen back in spring was you know taking that a step further okay seen what's the minimum we can do with the autos with those synthetic nudes but still got great yields okay then with this particular crop how can i integrate as much organics as possible and then finally make the switch where I'm just using organic products on a pretty much there now ladies and gentlemen so the next crop you see sometime in 2020 God knows where I'll be hopefully I'll be on the move applying for a lot of jobs internationally so anyone if you have received my CV take this video into consideration the mind knows how to cross course okay right now moving love and the purple tones don't stop get a load of this LA amnesia they can't you two just keeps on giving okay definitely the sugars and the frosty and fattest colors it luck quite possibly the pick of the litter if I'm honest it depends on the high now it's gonna take a lot to cut that new course very but this is in your direction swinging city but it's gonna be very uplifting as opposed to crack a lock and you can see no popcorn those few boards you say even the kind of stragglers I lollipop themselves just the top no bit so it's all lovely stuff and purple tones yeah that is now confirmed right this is what my hypothesis was going into it that it was the OG Kush if it's in the mix in their genetics and you got a bit of cold water then you'll see some purple tones and depending on how much of it is in there and if it is the real deal OD Kosh has been crossed in and you'll see because I didn't see it I'm a sense Easter because that's not cross that og cush and it didn't see it I'm a Mendocino skunk that's also that's not grass ecology cush but I think all these strains have a little bit of G caution including the atomic cell Hayes get a loaded up these purple tones super sugary nogs now these are actually beginning to rival the LM need very very frosty city without a paradise seeds folks and they don't take that long to flare get a load of this and we gate I reckon next week I'm gonna say now it's gonna be the last episode of the cultivation part and his series so there you have it folks say bye-bye to the blue coach berry been amazed so Colin time I'm eight weeks I'm furious flaring and that was nice you know eight weeks of adjective growth got your shooter mainline and that's another thing if you want to learn how to mainline yourself got a recommend this technique for all the kinds of growers indoors or outdoors want to get total control over your crop and the maximum yield only the top shelf colas that's in looking at a torchon yes absolutely I could have blasted all of these plants out with a variety of chemical fertilizers blown the boards off twice the size oh yeah I could have done that but it would have been fit for human consumption absolutely not why not gonna smoke it up that's another reason why you know I stay away from hydro if I can I'm not knocking it in a desperate situation as yeah as opposed to smoke and not yeah it smoke your highlighter but know when it's my own stuff I want the absolute perfect Sun growing cannabis as natural as possible no contaminants no unknown chemicals that will turn me or future generations and ways behind me into the elephant back you know all right honestly I'm waiting for that the near future gonna wheel a bloke out onto a stage with two heads and six-fingered hands and I'm gonna tell you a week ago you look like Brad Pitt and then you had tree going to

week it's the top shelf grower design now oh yes it's a good day to harvest some purple we have a great weekend and bye bye", "Zq0A1yS1wRk": "[Music] yes yes yes people where we are the deechi sent that absolutely flying along we've got the sun-god the kind LED absolutely smashing down on this is an XL 750 it's set on 20% red at the moment 35% blue and 35% white that does me that's really good just veg in these plants and just giving them a nice easy over the first week and then if we want the intensity up we can but as you can see they're absolutely stunning they're looking great little plants only in tiny little pots and you can see the stems on them they're cracking you know they're they're really really coming on so the idea now is to get them out of these little pots and to put them on to something a little bigger and we're gonna do a little experiment this time something that I've never done before but I'm definitely interested in giving it a go so I was watching the grand master level show and he was just about to harvest the load of his plants I don't know if you guys watch that and basically he was saying that next crop he's running he's gonna run it with soil and cocoa so I'm gonna be the same I thought was an interesting experiment I've got the time to do it so I'm gonna do it so I'm gonna take you guys over well I'm gonna set Coco Coco coco so this is a KOCO brick and they cost literally no money at all I paid like one one pound 50 for this and so it was no money at all and they expand into loads I've just got some PhD Walter here of just PhD it down to six point five and I just add the cocoa blocks into there I start with a little bit of all Ultra if I need to I put the first layer of water in there's but freely as a water to to cocoa box which I thought wasn't going to be enough but and I'd rather out then because I can't take away and so these these these bits are really hard so I've just got another two liters of water I'm just gonna add to the bucket and then just get these last bits breaking down and then I'm going to just leave it to Seco very messy in the gray room as you can see see these some of these are just like I've just gone through it and just broke it all up with my hands and you get like these little dry bits in there and it's important to just go through it with your hands break it up mix it all through and then like I said just leave it overnight I've got this son a gardening mat down here which I'll just put in lined in the bottom of my bathtub and then I've got one bag of all mix fire beers swim and I have got one sack this is my cocoa I've just transferred it into here so I'm just gonna mix one bag it's a two blocks of cocoa you know what happens next guys it's all mixed together it's a lovely light mix makes like all mix is quite light anyway with the perlite in everything but with the cocoa it makes even more like obviously you knew that the cocoa is gonna put more air in the soil and it's gonna dry out quicker and so then the plants are gonna be able to breathe a little bit more apparently this does wonders well we will soon see won't we guys nine plants nine partly there you go they're all planted up they've all had a good water ph 6.5 so normal stuff guys so let's see if this experiment works I hope to see some good results in the likeness of soil with the mix of the cocoa really quite excited about this experiment and I think it's going to go good when I seen Grandmaster love and the other guys on the panel talking about it it just seemed like such a good idea and to know that grand master level has got that many plants you know he's got a big big room there and to give something like that ago it must be worth giving it a go so let's have a go chaps like and subscribe see you all next time [Music]", "wlO8WpGZAUM": "[Music] this gram of blue cheese is out of this world I mean this color of blue cheese of these workers it's really really good shade my guys like you guys

Swiss cheese French cheese just regular cheese and I really like the cheese strained and I like it because of the I'm telling you when you have it you know you have it because it stinks like smelly cheese and it's really really stinky and it translates when you do the vape it really has a very unique taste nice taste but one thing I will say no matter how many times I've tries to cheese and I want to like it and give it a high score usually end of the day the something something's not as good as other strange but we're gonna check out it insane and saying has great flowers so we're gonna see if what we think of insane UK cheese so you can say comes in this packaging they've got a new plastic bag and I think this is probably holds better holds the freshness and better but none of these bags are really good and you can see that's 24.3% THC and it has point 0.5% CBD so it has some CBD and we like some CBD in our flowers it really does make a difference so tell you we're gonna try it out of vapor cup number two and you can see we have vapor cup number two set to 330 we have vaping the strong so we like the cheese and let's see what you Kate cheese is by insane so this flower has a unique taste it sweetie and I'd say it's I've seen cheesier Jesus but it's a weenie cheesy flower and the smell is really strong and even the vapor smell is really strong smells kind of like there's a skunk around somewhere and I'm telling you this flower is smooth like silk I took notes on this flower because for a little while I was like what's up but it was a creeper came on a little bit slowly and in the end I thought it was a good flower I wasn't super stoned and I wasn't not stoned I would say it's a medium stone which is okay it's good you could see I really liked vaping it I just doing it because it's really enjoyable but a weed entertainment we're looking for the best we're looking for the very best batches and you never know where it's gonna show up so is Yuuki UK cheese the best I'm giving this flower in 8.5 I really liked it maybe it could be an 8 7 5 somewhere in there it didn't hit the 9 it just wasn't euphoric enough for me but I liked it and I recommend it if you've never tried cheese insane UK excuse me insane UK cheese is definitely worth the try is the doctor for wheat entertainment paper cups available at vapor cup comm you want to email me you have any

the holy grail for all domestic cannabis growers is to grow their own perfect strain of cannabis plant for some of you the major thc high is the priority for others the cbd content is the target that makes your choice of plant easy as there are ones already in existence such as xx for high thc and yy for cbd potency but what if you want both the world of cannabis plant classification is adapting to meet this change in demand whereas we previously divided cannabis plants into cultivars cultivated varieties we are now beginning to class them as chemivars chemical varieties consequently many growers have been trying to perfect the double whammy the strain of cannabis that delivers on all fronts why they are doing this isn't so much from a commercial angle but more a botanical challenge the curious thing about cannabis though is that there does tend to be two distinct schools those of you who want the psychotropic high who love getting stoned or who are looking for pain relief while some others crave the mental benefits of cbd especially if the goal is to relieve stress or anxiety however while there are many laws surrounding the cultivation and use of cannabis there is no law which says you cannot enjoy the dual benefits of high levels of thc and cbd together so what are we talking about in terms of mixing strains how about royal demeanor and medical mass if you want psychoactive potency then look no further than royal demeanor with a 20 level you can then temper this with medical mass which has a 10 cbd content the result a high that's not quite out of control mixed with the clear-headed effects of a hefty dose of cbd enabling you to still function while being totally stoned alternatively what about sour diesel and og kush mix here you get bags of flavor and bags of thc while sour diesel is more a sativa strain and og kush is an indica heavy strain the combination will result in hitting the sweet spot time after time fancy a snack before a nap try mixing cheese with blue mystic while cheese gives you a terpenes-rich cheesy flavor in abundance blue mystic will balance this with sweetness sugars and fruitiness the result this time get the pillows

cookies by nectar farms now if you guys are like me and have never tried confidential cookies let's go ahead and talk about it so this strain has been brought to you by mad scientist genetics who have crossed confidential cheese and dream cookie to create this indica dominant hybrid strain it is a 70 indica 30 sativa and i can tell you just based on the looks of this stuff i am excited to try it so before we get into this review let me bring this stuff up on the screen for you guys to check out then we're going to take a look at it together okay so what do you think of the confidential cookies by nectar farms let me know in the comments below i will tell you what i am so excited to get this jar open here and take a look at this stuff okay this is interesting it's that typical cookie smell but it's kind of light it's it's very um it's sweet there's a little bit of the cheese kind of creeping through i actually smell a little bit of musk in there and that's definitely coming from the chi uh excuse me coming from the dream cookie there's no question about that but like a nice subtle kind of sweetness there and there are terps in this they're just not super loud i will tell you that upon grinding this stuff up all those flavors came out it really does smell like just cookies with some extra sweetness there so anybody who has tried any of the cookie strain strains you'll know the strand you know the smell that i'm talking about almost like um again just like a subtle sweetness is and it's very nice honestly it's very very nice and enjoyable but let's take a look at this stuff with the light oh my god besides like this one leaf that i'm looking at just having maybe a little bit of extra excess leaf material and this is the nug that i'm talking about you guys so to me i think this nug that i'm looking at right here could have actually been trimmed up a little bit better there's some excess leaf material on this bud but like it's really not bad i could tell it was still hand trimmed this stuff is covered in trichomes not only on the inside but they are coating the outside of this butt i mean they handled it this bud with absolutely the utmost care man gosh i don't know that little extra leafiness on this one bud is not my favorite though and that might affect the rating let me pull out the biggest nug in the jar here which was this one and this is one thing like you know when you get weed in a jar it should all be nugs like this i really shouldn't have popcorn tiny popcorn buds and i did have a few in this um which is kind of a little bit of a letdown but it's like it's actually it's funny it looks light green to the naked eye but it's really kind of on the darker side of green purple undertones some dark leaves interwoven throughout there these bright orange hairs really again nice coverage of trichomes on this bud i mean it really looks exceptional i mean the the proportion of crystals to hairs on this bud is honestly flawless you guys they did a great great job with this stuff now before i got started today i went ahead and i threw the confidential cookies on the penny pincher test to see if we can catch nectar farms penny pinching you guys know they give you 3.7 grams in their age so let's go ahead and get to the penny pinchers test right now to see if this weighs 3.7 grams okay so the time has come for the penny pinchers test let's see if the confidential cookies by nectar farms weighs 3.7 grams like it says they're on the package so let's go ahead get the scale turned on i'm gonna go ahead and put a dollar bill on the scale just to make sure that this weighs a gram and that we are calibrated okay perfect so basically this is just telling us that anything that i put on here is just going to be .02 grams heavier because this dollar bill should weigh exactly one gram so we'll take that into account let me go ahead i will put my cup on here let's go ahead and tear out the weight of the cup i will go ahead and get this jar open up now and let's go ahead and dump the contents right on in here and see if we are at three point oh yeah 3.75 grams that is a pass by nectar farms way to go you guys boom that's how it's done you guys 3.75 grams exactly what was stated on the package and that's what i got so i am very happy about that for sure you guys um now i can tell you that just based on the smell and the looks alone i'm really excited to try this stuff out it's not like it's super pungent out of the jar it almost smells a little bit like gmo but like i'm not a huge fan of gmo but this is some stuff that i can for sure get behind and i mean just based on the looks alone this is some stuff that i'm excited to puff on so today i am going to be enjoying the confidential cookies by nectar farms out of my arizer extreme q desktop vape i've got this bad boy set to 375 degrees fahrenheit as you see right there i have got the whip which is basically just the silicone tube that gets the vapor from the vaporizer to me the end with the screen on it that was just cleaned out as you see that one's gonna get plugged into the bowl itself which is sitting right on top of the vaporizer and i'm gonna take that right now and smell that almost like some cinnamon apple like like a crisp or something like that that's been sitting and it's warm on the oven or a warm apple pie truthfully what does it feel like it feels like warm apple pie i know a lot of you guys are going to be too young to know what that's from but it smells really good the nice subtle sweetness and again it kind of has like an appley type smell to that this end is going into the bowl which hits the top of the vaporizer it looks like that and that sits on top of the heating element of the vape itself now this end is going into my scientific inhalations triple filtered bubbler i'm only using two of the three filtration chambers today i've got distilled water in the second chamber i've got my organic cotton filter in the third chamber that'll filter out any potential impurities that might not have gotten purged down the final stages of growing or flushed you know um so i've got that in there but we know nectar farms grows clean medicine the first chamber there it sits in the downstem that actually holds carbon to prevent ash from reaching the water but you guys know since i'm vaping today we left the carbon out because there won't be any ash tainting my water today so if you guys are ready i know i certainly am so let's go ahead and try out some of this confidential cookies by nectar farms and see what it's all about wow i'll tell you what i actually got some visible vapor that is shocking now i'm getting kind of the prototypical gmo type flavor but it's really being overrun by this sweetness and then in my like nose all that i can smell is that like fresh um like soapy almost like a cotton lineny type taste but it's almost soapy it really soapy is the best word to describe it because when i breathe out that's all i can smell it's kind of just like some floral type soap so let me dive in for the second rip here and see how this bowl develops here on the second one wow another ultra smooth rip about 75 80 percent of the way through wow is that a big boy i'm still blowing out vapor i can feel this coming on now the flavor that soapy ness is starting to kind of fade a tiny bit here um but it's still the main predominant flavor that i am getting in my mouth um a bit of sweetness but it's really everything's being overrun by this soapy flavor that i have in my mouth and my tongue it's not overly powerful it's not like coating my mouth but boy is it there for sure and i'm not the biggest fan of the soapy terps to be honest but i'm curious to see how the bowl develops here so while i am finishing this bowl i'm gonna bring this stuff up on the screen for you guys to check out under the magnification of 25 times macro lens so you can get a little bit of a better up close and personal view of the confidential cookies so here they come now okay so you are looking at the confidential cookies by nectar farms and oh my gosh where do i even start i seriously think i am looking inside of a kaleidoscope there are so many colors i'm not sure if this bud is just that really light green coloration or if it's kind of on the darker side because you guys can see there's like patches of light there's some patches of dark some of those leaves on there are almost going towards the purple and then you've got that kind of just typical green there that you guys see on a few of those leaves there right in the middle most of these hairs are just that nice a little bit thicker than kind of the medium thickness but the bright orange i absolutely love the way the hairs offset this bun and can we reflect on how many trichomes are on this bud i can't even look at a part of this bud without seeing trichomes and as always this stuff like all of nectar farms was manicured just beautifully and perfectly absolutely looks hand trimmed the leaves have been trimmed right up to the bud and this is some exceptional looking okay so what did you think of the confidential cookies under that macro lens let me know in the comments below now let me tell you i just finished puffing some of this stuff and there's a lot i want to talk about i mean there was highs and there were certainly some lows too in all honesty um and i want to talk about those so how i do all of my strain reviews i rate all of these strains out of 10 0 being the worst 10 being the absolute best i break that down into four different categories look smell taste and potency it's that simple i'll assign up to 2.5 points each in each of those respective categories we'll tally up the total at the end and then i'll give you my final rundown on what i thought of the confidential cookies now anything seven or above will get the dank thumbs up approval stamp of approval here on the channel and then if it does get seven or above i'll tell you if i would recommend this trainer if i would go back up and pick this strain up again i mean this stuff was not cheap 50 bucks on the price tag plus tax it's like 55 bucks out the door for one of these jars so i want to talk about if it's worth your money or not so let's go ahead and start by talking about looks bag appeal or in this case jar appeal of this confidential cookies by nectar farms so here it comes one last time okay so you've seen this stuff multiple times and i want to start to talk about it let's go through the looks i've already told you it's kind of that dark coloration it's almost purple on the undertones of it but then there's some light neon um you know uh parts of the bud and uh some darker leaves as well there and you know on the bottom there's a very beautiful violet color on the bottom of the bud the only thing i don't like is one of those nugs was really a little bit leafy there's the uh little bit of violet there let's see if i can get that to actually focus on the um part of the bud there with the violet and it really does look look very legit covered in trichomes i just didn't like that little extra leafiness on that one bud but so it really would sit somewhere between a two and a two and a half but truthfully i think this is closer to two and a half than it is a two it's not the best looking butt i've ever seen so don't you know think that it is but this stuff i bought based on looks when i saw it i was like damn that really does look good you know not knowing anything about the strain so it's going to be a 2.5 out of 2.5 for the looks now the smell the smell is a bit faint and typically you know when it is faint like this like this is some gmo with a little bit of sweetness and it's kind of musky but like you really have to get your nose into the jar to really really appreciate it um you know when i open the jar though the flavor did come out a bit and it's not like there's no flavor i mean i could still smell something i smell cookies kind of like gmo i smell cookies and gmos when i'm smelling and you know for me the smell is there but it wasn't until i really broke it up and was grinding the herbs up that all of that you know aromatic flavor came out so what i would say is that the smell was good it wasn't great there's still some work it's kind of between a one and a half and a two this is another category where i'm going to give nectar the benefit of the doubt i want to give them a 2.0 in the smell of this stuff let's get to the taste the taste for me that soapy flavor just does nothing for me this stuff was pretty smooth i have a tiny bit of scratchiness on my throat right now which is a little unusual smooth going down this was just after the puff um and that's not super enjoyable honestly that i don't really like all that much and the thing about this that really missed besides just that soapy flavor was that the flavor just died like even that soapy flavor it just went to like just the floury burnt kind of flour taste and it just did not hold through the end of the bowl and that was really a letdown for me i think it's a 1.5 i don't think it's a one i think it's a 1.5 i mean there was some flavor there if you like soapy tasting buds i mean it's almost hard to describe until you've had it but like think of just what you would think of with soap i mean it's a little floral it was a little sweet it's just not not my favorite honestly but it wasn't bad so it's gonna be a 1.5 in the taste just wish it didn't die so quick now let's get to the potency for me you know i feel okay i really do i feel actually decent but i don't feel like a 70 30 indica 70 indica 30 sativa this is hitting me more like a balanced hybrid which is actually what it says here on the package it says indica slash uh you know sativa when i looked up the genetics it did say 70 30 it's maybe more like a 60 40 or a 50 50 the way that it's affecting me i have a nice slight pressure on my head and i feel okay i feel okay i don't feel like i would say i'm like feeling really really good and really medicated i feel like my head is kind of where i'm feeling the medication the most just that pressure on my head a little bit of relaxation in the body um i'm pretty clear-minded and focused a little bit of haziness in the head not really too much heaviness on the eyes just a little bit and you know for me it's just leaving a lot to be desired i i don't even know that i would put this in the like it's between a 1.5 and a 2. it really is it's between a 1.5 and a 2. this is one of the categories i don't think i'm gonna give nectar the benefit of the doubt and give them the two because i don't think it's leading up to the two i think it's rounding more close closer down to the 1.5 in the potency so for me it'll be a 1.5 in the potency department so if you have been following that was a 2.5 in the looks a 2.0 in the smell 1.5 in the taste and a 1.5 in the potency it's a 7.5 and honestly i think a 7.5 is pretty much exactly where this stuff sits i think it's hitting just like a a 7.5 which means it's gonna get our dank thumbs up approval here on canopedia for sure um anything seven or above gets that stamp but would i go pick this straight up again i personally would not pick this straight up again it's an easy no for me i mean there are just way too many other strains 55 bucks like to not have the look is okay because it can make up for it in the taste smell and potency you know um even the smell if it doesn't have the smell that's okay it can make up for it in the taste and the potency but to not have the taste and potency i think those two hold the most weight by far of all of the the parts of the review like how does it taste did it smoke good and uh just do you feel good you know how do you feel do you feel medicated so for me those are the two like biggest parts of the review i mean if you're not getting a 2.0 and higher in those two categories it's it's a pretty easy no for me so no i wouldn't pick up this nectar farms um there was too many areas where it could have gotten the benefit of it doubt and gone down like the smell could be considered a 1.5 for some people for sure the look for sure could be considered a two uh instead of a 2.5 um you know somebody might consider the potency of two instead of a 1.5 that could be argued as well uh i don't think you could argue the taste any higher than a 1.0 in all honesty i think a 1.0 is actually very nice and generous on the taste because this is not leaving a lot for me to be desired but it is still 7.5 which is again going to get the dank thumbs up approval here but yeah i wouldn't go back for this uh confidential cookies by nectar farms what do you guys think let me know in the comments below is it a 7.5 am i absolutely crazy and then let me know what you want to see me review as well and until the next one you guys take care of yourself and one another and i look forward to seeing you again soon peace yeah", "Bm6doKbuHkQ": "hello youtube and welcome to episode number two of my first indoor grow with 400 watt metal highlight and a high pressure sodium so yeah the last episode I talked to you guys about my setup I showed you guys a little bit of the setup and what I was gonna be working with this season and this episode we're gonna be touching up on some of the strains that I'm gonna be drawing and the one that I want to share with you guys it's the alien og I'm only using I'm only gonna be using one clone of alien og for this grow so we're gonna see how it turns out and hopefully we get good results and we can use it again for the next season so the alien og as you guys can see it it's an indica sativa hybrid the breeder is a cal connection and the dispensary where I actually got the clone from they actually got it from the cattle connection so it does good both indoor and outdoor and here's some of the genetics as you guys can see here it's a cross between Tahoe og and alien crush and as you guys can see the Tahoe G is cross between the og courage and SF be OG Kush which is a San Fernando Valley so here's some of the other genetics and most of this plan its indica dominant so you know I I grow for a patient that suffers from migraines so I'm very specific with the strengths that I get for this patient the sativa strains don't sit well with her and actually cause her to get headaches so we stay away from those at Eva's for this patient and we go with nothing but indicas or hybrids but specifically indica dominant plants so you guys can see here the San Fernando Valley strain genetics the alien cush genetics and what the alien cush is cross with pretty good pretty good strains in the in the genetics of this strain the family tree is pretty strong and here's some results of the THC 16% you know not bad CBD point 20% and so on I also want to touch up on some CBD strains on the next episode so stay tuned for that one so yeah this is the cali connection alien OG and we're growing one clone from this breeder and now we're gonna be gone with blue cheese the blue cheese is a Barney's farm strain the the blue cheese also does good an indoor and outdoor it's mostly indica as I told you guys and about the other one we we tend to go with the indicus for for this specific patient flower in time sixty days which is what we will we prefer eight to nine weeks flowering period and the genetics are Big Buddha cheese crossed with blueberry for the outdoor harvests you're looking at the end of September and here's some of the you know genetics and the phenotypes like I said you know about sixty days it does well both indoor and outdoor the year is pretty good all together like they say here you know it's it's quite recommendable so you know the harvest on outdoor it's about the end of February we actually are shooting for mid-january maybe the beginning of February so but we're gonna see how how they how they react and during the vegetation stage first well yeah so here this is the you know some of the genetics as you guys can see here you know it's it's a pretty good strain and you know it's it's got pretty good a pretty good genetics and phenotypes here I don't know if you guys have any experience with some of these strains that I'm showing you guys and I'm sharing with you guys but if you do please share them with me I'm gonna be going to clones from this one and you know hopefully we get good results THC 18% a little bit higher on the CBD and I'm actually in the worse of growing for another patient but this patient specifically wants CBD strain so we're gonna be touching upon some CBD strains also on the next episode and you know I want to know what you guys also know about CBD high CBD strains so this is the the blue cheese alright guys now we're gonna be going to the purple diesel and the purple D saw I couldn't give you know - too much information on it but you know here's some of the information that I was able to give it's also a hybrid it's Sour Diesel mixed with a purple kush it's 5050 but you know somewhere Diesel's have been known to do really good for migraine or headache patients so here's the yield not much information but from what I've researched it's it's a good yield er not great but good yield ER CBD only 2% I saw high THC 16% switch what we're looking for like I mentioned before you know higher THC sometimes cost you to get a little bit of a head high and we try to stay under a 19 percent THC I know some of you guys probably are asking why but you know for this specific patient under 19 percent you know and personal preference that's totally different so flowering period nine to ten weeks we're hoping for no later than nine weeks maybe you know we're gonna see how it does and hopefully we can we can go no later than nine weeks so this is the purple D so once again if you guys have any information on the purple diesel please you know let me know and you know let me know a little bit of what you know here's a little bit of the history that I was able to actually find on the purple diesel and you know it's uh you know it has a lot of you know good information on the purple diesel so I'm sure you guys able to see some of this information here but you know it does have a healthy green pigment right now so I'm really looking forward to it turning purple and starting to smell sourly I mean that's you know that's later on during harvest stage but you know I can't wait for that time so this is a you know some of the restraint history for the purple diesel okay and now we're going to be going to the black water excuse me for this here we go so the black water strain is also a calculation strain it's also mostly indica it's also a sixty-day and as you guys can see here it's a first-generation mando perps makes it also another San Fernando Valley og and this one um you know it's a so far I mean a really good things about the Blackwater here's some of the genetics in the family tree so you know mando perps crossed with San Fernando Valley in the Mendel perps is obviously mostly indica San Fernando Valley as you guys saw on the alien og what it was crossed with and that's the Afghani also and what that's cross with a beer but it's mostly you know mostly indica indica dominant and that's exactly what we're looking for in the contaminant strains so we're gonna be you know doing some super cropping on this black water I'm going to be growing two clones of the black water so we're gonna see how that goes and you know flowering time eight to nine weeks or like I said before we're shooting for a but you know we can't fully fully control what these plants want and what they what they need so they need a little bit longer then we'll go ahead and let that happen I'll be a guy's you know this is gonna be my second at least you can say indoor grow I have done a few in their burrows but see it fails and I don't really you know consider that a real real marijuana grow but you know we're going to be going with this operation this time and hopefully we get great results hopefully the patient is happy with the results and you know we can continue to grow as as growers and we continue to learn and you notice what this is all about I want you guys to please you know give me some comments if you guys have any questions you know I'm not a professional grower but every day you learn something new and that's what this is all about stay motivated continue to have a happy grow stay positive around your plants play some music around your plants and do your homework before you start anything you you realize that by doing a little bit research you know you will have better results so this is all brought to you by CE finder and marijuana calm so check them out they have been very helpful for information on the strengths that I'm growing and they have pretty detailed information on the genetics and then you can also do some research on genetics yourself so don't want to take up too much of your time thank you for staying tuned and stay tuned also for episode number three where we're going to be talking about some CBD strains and we're also going to be taking a look at the clones and see how they're doing they're going to be going into bigger pots we're going to be preparing them for the flower stage we're going to be talking about some of the nutrients and we also got to be talking about some different methods all super cropping so thank you guys and have a happy grow please subscribe give me a thumbs up and stay tuned for the next episode that'll day week guys", "sip8VhFVHys": "[Music] hey guys what's going on welcome back to another stream review today we got an awesome stream that we wanted to review for a while too it is called strawberry banana [Music] [Applause] strawberry banana is a hybrid with 70 indica and 30 sativa so it's an indica dominant hybrid and it's a cross between strawberry bubble gum and crockett banana kush this strange gac levels range from 22 to 26 which is why what the hell is stuck in here which is why it's a really good stream for draining all oh wow let's take this all of this out this is really good to treat um appetite loss depression stress chronic pain because it's htac content oh it smells so good okay this right off the back as soon as i open the container oh this is a pretty cool container right a lot of people think it's an actual soda you you can see i have a video of this that i put that i made with this so if you want to check the video showing you somewhere over here you know the drill it's going gonna pop up dude click it and you can see it there anyways so i was telling you the smell of it is sweet earthy earthy sweet smell it doesn't smell like strawberry like i thought it would it would actually do you know but it smells really good it's most fruity though well not so much fruity but it smells more like earthy but sweet oh wow look at all those strike homes okay break it open and that sweetness just gets better and that mom's pronounced in fact over here does smells fruity when you actually oh yeah oh wow it smells like bubble gum it smells like candy bubble gum oh it smells great let me show you all of these strike combs that are in here it's white i hope my camera can can capture this let me show you this beauty look at this guys look at that let's grab this piece over here real quick because the camera is having a hard time focusing so let's give it just one thing to focus on look at that all of this white is caked on this all these white trichomes it's beautiful oh that is a great smell but it's not pungent he's really pronounced when you break it so on the outside without breaking it you got this this earthy smell to it like this earthy tone break it open and it's like breaking open a bubble gum like when you open a pack of bubble gum and you just smell to it that's how it smells it smells really good i was expecting to smell some bananas but now it just smells fruity it smells real fruity i can see why it is one cannibal's cup he actually want two kind of cup if i'm not mistaken oh it smells so good this thing has won several awards including the first sativa flower a 2015 on the honeywell on the high time cannabis cup and the first josh's choice cannibal cop in brazil in 2016 i think it was oh wow oh you know what let's grind some though because that smell the more i break it the more i can smell the sweetness to it it has a really sweet smell earthy on the outside like i said but real sweet on the inside so i'm really hoping that it's going to taste sweet like that like i'm not expecting to taste the strawberries or because you can't even smell it you don't even smell terpenes actually it's not like that pineapple express that we had that you know it was like so pineappley it's like it was dipped on pineapple or something those terpenes were like really pronounced but in here i mean even though it's called strawberry banana i don't smell any terpenes it smells really sweet like a candy sweet bubble gum sweet and oh man let's just let's just try it let's see what it tastes like here just put up a little bit more i like this man let's take that outside so i can keep on smelling it i mean you got to ring it to your face i'll people doing that it's not pudging either oh wow look at this you know what i think we gotta grind this one instead we're gonna grind this one instead and that's always green bow brand new screen oh man grind up now i could smell it all the way over here like before you grind it if you break it bring it to your face it smells so good grind it and you don't have to bring it to your face he actually it comes to you it's a great smell i like it i like it that first hit was a little bit harsh a little bit harsh however i was able to taste the sweetness you can definitely taste that sweet taste to it it smells like bubble gum but it doesn't taste like it but it does taste sweet it has an undertone smell of earthy smell but you do not taste that earthy taste to it so it's just like smoking a sweet strain it's really good okay i'm on the fourth hit now the flavor is no longer there it's starting to get a little more harsh on the third one i coughed a little and it was starting to get harsh but now it's a little harsher and it has no flavor all right we finished the bowl surprisingly i don't know how but it finished smoother then they started i don't know how that happened but i it was a little harsh on the third hit harsher on the fourth coughed as i finished it it just got smoother i was still getting a hit so but the flavor was good on the third head that's kind of disappointing it's been only one ball i packed it really good i finished it i'm already feeling it i'm not feeling relaxed so i'm not feeling like my pain is gone but i'm not sober like how's that it's already hitting me like i'm not stoned i am not like hell you gotta try this man no but it's it's surprising that i gotta deal with your smoke a bow and i'm already not sober it's already hitting me that first hit is so good it's so good because you really taste that sweetness that bowl of that candy flavor is awesome anyone really down really smooth you know what we should try it off the babe let's try it off the baby i don't know if you guys seen the review for this before but if you haven't check check up here you know you know the drill is up here somewhere it's gonna yeah click it and um so let's test it out let's just put something here let's wait for it to warm up that's what i like about this one the only thing is that that is it works out pretty fast oh wow i'm gonna say the flavor it's way more pronounced and it has a really really good aftertaste like you you could you still tasted it hate after hit do you taste it i lost you know what this is gonna be one of these strains that i'm gonna rather put on a vape than a bowl i haven't tried out of a droid yet but the joint i don't have any raw black which is my favorite papers raw black and any other paper joining it always changes the flavor of the cannabis so for a review i like to stick to glass or vape which is that you know this is good actually i'm gonna stick to vaping this this is the forehead now still got the same flavor it's like got the same flavor it's still smooth so you know i think in my personal opinion this is the type of strain that you just want to put in one of these or any babe whatever whatever vape source you're using like if you have a pen or a portable one or a volcano volcano is the best volcano is the best wow i am i'm stoned now i'm feeling like really relaxed now my body is starting to feel loose i don't feel tense i feel relaxed i feel good flavor wise is really good on on on a portable baby i've been taking many hits in this one i'm already stoned how long has it been it's been only a matter of minutes and it hit me right away it was only three hits into this when i started feeling the effects then i finished the ball i was feeling already then i switched to this and now i'm like i'm good i'm really good see one thing i like and it's like right away it hits you with that cutting mouth oh i don't like that it's too fast now you see all the strings it's after a while i'll get the cotton mouth but right now i'm getting it like right away after one bowl and couple of hits of this and i liking it but i am so blasted though like you know i don't think this is the type of strain that you want to smoke before you have something to do like basically anything i'm stuck i feel like as time passes by i'm gonna get stuck on stupid i wonder how is it gonna go when i started editing this video it's gonna be fun it's not been fun it's not i keep consulting out like i mean spacing out i'm looking at the music at the track at the editing and and and i just stare at it and space out i'm supposed to do a cut or something and i'm spacing out thinking about the cut and thinking about thinking about thinking about the cut i know no this is not the strain that you want to smoke before any task public service announcement so let's finish this video while i still got some brain cells left like here's what we know about this strain it's an indica dominant uh 70 indica 30 sativa come on let me let me move to brain cells a little bit more this way from strawberry bubblegum and and and what was the other one um crooked banana yeah it's it's it's really good with stress anxiety uh chronic pain loss of appetite which by the way have not felt at all i'm not hungry at all yeah no it's not that bad that it tastes really good smells really good it doesn't smell like strawberry or banana however it does taste and smell like bubble gum the first couple of hits are awesome after that on the ball starts getting really harsh it tastes way better off of vape this can go between 22 and 26 percent cac one two cannabis cups oh yeah so i mean it's a really good strain overall and if i have to release i will say i'll give it eight out of ten make it eight point five holy crap it hits fast it hits hard damn i don't think i'm gonna be looking forward to editing i bet you're gonna have problems all right guys thank you so much for watching i'll see you

"okay so I'm doing another video right now mmm and the strange that I have for today is cheese candy wonderful strange cheese candy is 8020 sativa dominant hybrid and it's cheese cross with Carmelo so two really great strains and both these trains have skunk um so this is a pretty pungent smelling strain very dense nug solid lot of orange red hairs from far away I thought the bud look really Brown pull anyhow I really enjoyed medicating with this and I wake and bake like this midday afternoon time evening time just totally great the whole entire day had a wonderful day it's very happy and for ik uplifting kind of energetic in the beginning motivating you get to get things done kind of like very productive but it also has a crash so that's something you got to watch out for it's got crash slight munchies and dry mouth will cut him out so those are like things I noticed with that the crash is kind of strong too well for me it was and I don't get much sleep at night I sleep late I wake up early so I already shortchanged myself with sleep all the time so if something is gonna be couch locking or you know have any had those things I'll feel it I'm pretty sensitive to that so yeah for me it just kind of wasn't just gnawing at me the whole time like it was on the decline about three and half hours after medicating I noticed I was feeling really Authority yawning a lot just doing run around I was always looking for like a bench or some place to go sit down and chill looking for a spot to go mary-kate couldn't find any spots man so it's kind of brutal but I pushed through and I made it and Here I am today and survived on all that stuff survive to be able to come and Medicaid another day and this is wonderful it's got a bit of a kick to it but after like after your first book we still work in a second your lungs kind of adjust its are nice not harsh at all they're smooth because absolutely flavorful you get all that that nice taste it's on that's in this and it's kind of like some really dang amaretto some kind of creamy putting your tea or coffee really nice it has a bit of tickle in the lungs so you might find yourself like mm-hmm doing stuff like that a little bit of coffee here and there but other than that really nice I like it um I would totally get this again I really enjoyed medicating with this really nice high body stone is wonderful the pain relief that's about three three and a half hours long long and the high is about the same really great from what I read is good for stress depression anxiety and even though this is a sativa dominant I didn't experience any anxiousness or nervousness with this train even when I was kind of in that uppity energetic beginning you just kind of a it's slightly kind of focused at times it can get hazy though it's got a really nice vibe to it though you feel kind of warm and fuzzy kind of like tingly high throughout your body in the beginning but it's really nice I really enjoyed a medicating with this strainer I definitely get this again man because I really restraint to uh to have on a daily basis you know", "IZ-4l6u2s8I": "oh gee deliveries presents the review of deviant dabs raphson 1,000

"91gmYu1RI3Y": "what's happening all you stoners and stow nets out there in YouTube land it is a brisk wind e spring day and on this windy and brisk spring day I'm bringing y'all a strain review we have again by a pills cultivation there blue cheese now this isn't the only rendition of blue cheese out there and Washington DC right now there has been alternative solution blue cheese floating around I know it's at a couple of dispensaries right now if people are familiar with the rules and DC rules and laws that govern medical marijuana in Washington DC patients have to choose one dispensary and only go to that one dispensary so unfortunately I do not have access to blue cheese by alternative solutions right now that I could do like a head-to-head bash with them I would love that but it's just not going to happen probably because I don't think capital city care is going to buy more blue cheese when they already have blue cheese on the menu so what are my thoughts on this blue cheese by appelles and I'm also going to compare it to the blue cheese I have had from alternative alternative solutions but of course that's all done by my memory and everything like that and there's any of you good little stoners a stone at snow or memory can be not so great it sometimes but I'm gonna do with the best I can first of all and with this blue cheese it smells good I'm the very first thing it's like anything you see with the name blue in it and then blueberry and all that you get a really strong blue sent to it not with this stuff though I didn't pick up any of that blueberry kind of great be you know blueberry kind of scent to it but it smelled good it was like some it's some earthy kind of pungent skunk you know our romo to it so it the cheese was what's really coming out and not the blueberry the it you know it looks there's a lot of trichomes on it but frankly the trim job could be a little bit better so appelles cultivation c'mon guys you can do a little bit better on your trimming there's a lot of families in this I gave you a pass on the on the blue oh gee because of the compact nature of the buds and structure and everything the way it look but this looks kind of lazy I'm going to give it a taste and I'm going to let you know exactly what I think of this blue cheese there's the blueberry tasty yep there's the blueberry cheesy skunk2 definitely taste the skunk in it you see me going right back for another taste of this good stuff I'm liking this for their first harvest from them good job with to the blue cheese you know I know that it's only going to get better the blue OG and I ready to a 2.5 but I know that you know once they get everything on track there they learn the plant you know after a couple more harvests from it they know exactly you know the nutrients and everything what to do to bring out everything that's right in the planet I believe that they can do it this blue cheese the only thing I need to do with it is make it a little bit more powerful a little bit more potent see how they can bring that out it's rated at sixteen percent THC yeah and then like one percent TV is what i have on for the test data so yeah if they can bump up the potency you know finally figure out how to do that i would i would say this is going to be some great bud right now as it stands i'm gonna have to give it three and a quarter star it would be three and a half stars but the trim jobs got to take it down a little bit but definitely if you want something a little bit different than the other stuff on the menu and you want to try out a new grow people in town then pick up some of those blue cheese i would definitely pick the blue cheese over the blue OG as it stands right now and i am really looking forward to the new strands coming out by a pills and you know i'm looking forward to all that they can do and it can only get better so until that time stay stoned", "r7rhl6dPchM": "Milo I'm big brother now we're

another video what's up guys my name is Matt welcome again to Mr Cook nuts grill and I just want to say welcome to all the new subscribers that's right we've had over 2,000 subscribers in the last seven days that it's just lit you guys rock man really appreciate all you guys clicking that subscribe button hitting the like jeez man you guys Rock really appreciate it okay well this video is going to be another harvest video another one I'm not going that's right another harvest video can you believe it my last three videos have been harvest videos just to bring out the speed we had an auto flower crow which we had four Auto flower strains they were kind of all doing their own thing and finishing on their own time which then created a bunch of harvest videos and this is the fourth in last harvest of the auto flower run and that is the white widow auto flower from Dean fm now I just want to point out if you are curious in those other harvest videos just go back into my channel's video playlists and you can watch them there now let's get into this white widow the structure let's just start off with the structure the structure of this plant is incredible such a large auto flower in comparison to the other three I just took down and yeah I'm very impressed honestly the size and just overall structure is bang-on next is the THC trichome production which is a big thing for me I love pressing for rosin and honestly honestly the Auto flowers aren't something I expect I'll be pressing for rosin just because they don't produce the same THC trichome potencies as photoperiod doing just ask the honest truth I found the sell firsthand by actually growing photo periods and actually growing Auto flowers impressing them both I've always managed to get more rosin more yield return when using photo periods but that doesn't mean the auto flowers don't have a point in place in your grow room I actually run three grow setups and the middle grow I have is an auto flower slash bedroom so while I vege my plants my photo peering plants for my flower rooms I do actually put a couple Auto flowers in that room to increase my yield I run all my Auto flowers on an 18-6 lake schedule and I do that right from the start so I pop them right into the three gallon pot and I finish them off in that three gallon pot and they are under eighteen six the entire time back to the white widow we managed to get a gorgeous fade on this girl some beautiful colors are coming through we got a lot of purples and yellows of course we got those dead dying leaves which we are gonna remove before we actually chop and hang dry I was a little bit nervous based on the fade that I was gonna have a little bit too much amber trichomes in ratio to the cloudy try calm well after pulling out my 45 x micro scope and getting right in there I actually found an immense amount of cloudy trichomes in just a few amber so I'm very happy right now with the overall fade and the old-world Shrike production and of course the huge size and structure of this plant it's just a home run if you're a beginner and you're looking to get into some auto flower grows I just really recommend this white widow from Xena femme even the Moby Dick from the nfm it's not a huge tall plant but that is incredible bud structure size so those two plants are great beginners once again those are from Dena fan that's the white widow and/or Moby Dick so after removing all of the dead yellowing leaves we obviously are gonna hang this plant I normally like to hang my plants whole but this plants just too big to hang in hole so I'm gonna cut it down into a few pieces still keep the whole plant very big I want to actually extend my dry time my environment is not the world's best for drying so I need to keep my plants whole keep as much foliage on there as I can this way I get my 8 to 10 day drive Pirie which is like the most ideal for me I find when you get a nice lower dry you do have a lot more flavors when you are smoking that joint three months down the road after a nice cure that part of the video is done I still kind of want to just give you a quick update on the three grouse I have going so let's not waste any time here's the Otto bedroom we have one gorgeous Otto from Canucks seeds that is the Otto cheese we managed to build an amazing structure on this plan through low stress training and the foliated this plant just had a lot of leaves everywhere just blocking all kinds of bud sites I made it a point to get those leaves out of there increase the light penetration and after we did this gave this girl a good two weeks itch to recover and look at her now she's looking beautiful great structure we're gonna have a lot of hugh colas and i basically by doing this we're increasing our yield potential so definitely recommend doing that i also want to mention that not every plant requires that heavy did defoliation like this this one definitely did we have this girl under the meysy 600w both with some veg and blue switches on for a total of 277 true watts from the wall we also popped for more otto flowers which you know what i'll go through in a later video but for now we just have them under the meise 300 with just a veg switch on which pulls a hundred true watts from the wall we also have our Mars hydro 5x5 grow tent and in this tent we have nine photo period strains and this is the grow that I'm super excited for to get into flower I came out wait we got some absolutely dank strains in here fear just vegging away very nicely this week I hooked them up with top dressing of Gaia green organic amendments I mainly only use the four for for all purpose with a small ratio of the 284 to help induce some wreath development we have these girls under the my Z 900 W and the Mars heiko reflector 960 with just the vet switches on in those total about 550 true watts together of course once we have in the flower we're gonna flip both the blue switches on on both those lights and it will give us a total of 820 true watts for that 5x5 Pro 10 and that's with LEDs our last grow is just a small 2 by 3 closet grow have five strains in one gallon pots in week five of flour this will be a small yielding room but 100% pure fire strains we have here we have the black dog and chocolate mint og from Humboldt sedum organization and we have Morning Glory and LSD from Barney's farm as well as bubble G from Canuck seeds and we're back nope it's got to go face no all about presentation okay that's this week's video I really hope you

"sDPRI1-obCI": "hey guys a sneaky Pete here and today I'm gonna be bringing you a review for Blue Dream by Aurora now I bought this on November 14th it was packaged on September 10th I'm hoping to see it a little bit fresher than that but maybe that's just going to be the norm now the stats on the Blue Dream it is a sativa THC is at 17% and CBD is 0% this strain cost $7.99 for one gram let's go ahead and open it up I haven't bought a 1 gram before so I'm interested to see how this packaged up and ok similar to a 3.5 grams just on a smaller scale a little black package like this blue dream sativa let's go ahead and open that now this is 17.1% 17.1 1700 k 17.1 i stand corrected okay let's go ahead and open it up here a very childproof container like unnecessarily so this was already open here this wasn't sealed like on the other ones so jeez let's go ahead and pour that out a lot of flavor but you know a little disappointing so far okay and there's a gram so I mean it certainly looks nice not getting a lot of smell here don't a lot of aroma whatsoever I think it was because this has been opened you know theoretically since early September so as you're seen for the ground here we've got a few small main buds seems to have a nice trim on it though not seeing a lot of little leaves or extra bits that should have been cut off get on that odor we're just not getting much at all hopefully we're gonna get some more aroma here now that we're gonna grind it yeah it's quite dry really I wouldn't have ground it that much how's that dry see if we get any more smell no definitely a little more of those pine tones but nothing too recognizable so I'm gonna load this up into an air Iser solo - I'm going to turn this at about say 375 that's the regular temperature I vape at on most vapes you know every vapes a little bit different but I usually set it at around a temperature like that and adjust from there I just clean the stem so it's completely clean so we should have a very very clear and true flavor profile on this strain now when you load something like a solo to properly the herb just stays suspended in the stem so it's not coming into contact with the heater you give a very very good flavor on this fate go ahead and load that in there just let it get to temperature it's already there but give it a few minutes to really warm up let's give this stuff a go mmm so I'll get a little citrus little pine nothing too much though I'd say pine is kind of the main flavor I'm getting definitely tastes better than it smells doesn't taste amazing but it certainly doesn't taste bad there is a nice flavor to it sometimes when you have lower quality or really dry herb you get that plant flavor that kind of chlorophyll flavor personally I really don't like that flavor for me that is just bad herb so if vapes really really nice it is very smooth can certainly start to feel those sativa effects kicking in already but what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna finish this bowl I'm going to finish the entire thing here then I'm gonna set my timer for 15 minutes I'm gonna come back in 15 minutes because I think it'll be better to report on the effects after that [Music] hmm so there you go still pretty smooth that's about what I would say is you know a good length session for me for one person I don't know 10 hits was that definitely a little bit more than normal but I really wanted to experience the effects so see you guys in 15 minutes okay so it's been 15 minutes and I think that's maybe a better way to assess the effects cuz you know it does take a bit to kick in and to really see what you're gonna get so overall that is a very very nice sativa it's not super speedy you don't get that kind of you know anxiety sort of like this it's a little more relaxing and euphoric but it wasn't couch lock II certainly did feel it in my body though so overall not you know super impressed with the date it was packed on as compared to when I'm getting it flavors good not great but overall the effects are very very good I definitely would try this strain again I would hope to get a little bit of a fresher batch though and probably something with a better seal on it you know what I mean what's the point of having the seal if it's not going to be closed so overall this is one I would try again especially for $7.99 so I hope you enjoyed that stray interview guys that's Blue Dream by Aurora keep it green keep it sneaky and we'll see you next time", "hATKOs0dtNo": "[Music] what's up well juvenile Styles coming at you with a cannabis review so today we got blue

people what is up we are here and we have a new strain to review from a clinic we haven't ever reviewed this time we frame it down to Breda altar medicine right yeah Bray alternative medicine in Brea California yeah it's kinda it's sitting right next to us so it's pretty close to us and apparently time to pick up some of their stuff and this is some of their dark blue it's a sativa dominant strain I'm assuming it's a blue dream crossed with some kind of like a purple or something like that it's got a very familiar blue dream thing going on the really earthy kind of slightly citrusy pion kind of essence but it's got this really nice sweet smell to it really indicated indicative of like some not only like a purple it kind of smells like a Romulan to me like that across of a sweetness and the more sativa end of things it's just really really nice and got a really nice buzz structure I'm gonna try and change the lighting real quick whoa camera took a phantom and knocked it right off the table that was my bad back back to what was going on so as you can see in the lighting it's really really frosty it's got a really nice snow structure - it's just really really covered in frost this one was really surprising for the amount of THC on this thing man just a ton of crystals on this guy all I know specifically it's a high THC content but there's a ton of trade heads on this thing they're really really lush beauty buds it's a little dry little dense but on the outside what's very very dense very nice but it's really key fee to the container you guys can see a lot of Keefe buildup on the inside there it's just really really keep these stuff break a little piece off for the ball here oh well the nut kind of broke in half so okay sorry well not working how quietly I wanted so I was gonna hold it it's a really really nice soft little little baby aren't chairs in there let's get some weird art slightly off colored undertones my song borderline purple I guess there's very few there's something great down at the corner and stuff just a few dark undertones you don't ever really see in blue dream and just really nice looking what's hairs are almost completely covered up it was like white thorns it's really thorny looking for really good stuff time to break apart with the piece of the stone packing up in the blue take a snapchat out this little [ __ ] lights coming in really an ending we've been smoking a good bit of oil this morning because I took my last final today or the last important one my friends over here studying for his because he's got a few coming up sucker okay but uh so I'm nice and thoroughly medicated in the celebration of the day because I might enjoy the [ __ ] out of this weekend about to go over to Molly and Tyler is a little bit too obsessed with them get some new glass for us to check out as always it's [ __ ] ridiculous those two yeah Oh Molly and Tyler other their glass bang oh it's like every three days they have like a new piece it's not even like cheap pieces they're all like heavy ass like some of that half of that there's new rigs like straight up rigs oh my god damn I have like I need that I need that cash flow to spend too much on the concentrates yeah I just picked [ __ ] the police awesome some would come do a little upshot like this little up angle see how this works out I know the bomb is a little dirty I've cleaned it in a while cuz the finals just finished so I'm gonna start doing a whole bunch of editing I have all the CCC videos I gotta edit and a few other ones and I have a lot of glass to clean I've had these bowls soaking in an alcohol for like I don't even know probably like five six days I've just been so busy I have like that's how busy I've been I can't rinse out [ __ ] [ __ ] so this is what the blue dream from alternative medicine Thanks keeping me honest Cheers really good flavor just real typical blue-jean flavor for sure that was gonna be a little sweeter in flavor from the smell it's just a really really good solid blue dream for sure I'm sure there's other parts playing playing around in this thing besides just a regular blue dream stuff you know because it's dark blue and it's got some different coloration but I'm just talking about in terms of flavor it's just real typical blue dream just slightly brings out the citrus a little bit more it seems it's not as earthy in flavor it's got a bit more citrus coming out in the flavor oh but not even like zoomed in on this [ __ ] here we go in the light a little bit better you can see just very very frosty stuff real nice just pure green coloration on the inside just really healthy looking green it's probably something that outdoor crop that's coming through possibly I'm not really sure but I hear there's supposed to be a [ __ ] ton of blue dream this year very very good stuff from Brea surprisingly good medicine from Brea I wasn't expecting that being so close to us I was expecting them to suck but they're pretty good so I'll see you guys for the next one piece of pop", "zDe2a6S6Mj4": "ooh sorry what up guys welcome back Klaus TV this 21 / channel dedicated to people of marijuana music sports and gaming so today's episode surprisingly we're gonna be doing a strand of you so hope you guys at home have you spoken to by slaughter to join counter to the part about showing as always the heifer a challenge we guys have enough bulldog hurry up every time you see me to get a summary why don't want you guys at home to do the same and smoke along with me so I have to just gotten this gift it to me alright I just got a little bit against it to me but we happen to have some blue berry Kush I finally got something blueberry some real blueberry blueberry cook this is blueberry x OG Kush to mother [ __ ] bad-ass dreams put together hopefully to make one really good strength this is grown by Gaia cannabis like I said we're very cush one gram I did I did not get a gram by biggie little bit I did you little bit of it the guy get to you so let's go ahead and show you guys the stature poor again to the [ __ ] that strain review here so Gaia cannabis company harvest date was for 30 or 2016 strain name blueberry curse string type this is to get indica dominant hybrid total THC is 22 point thirteen percent total CBDs are pulling 10 percent total cannabinoids are 26 point forty five five percent Delta 9 THC maximize 25.20 to Delta nine ket is 25.10 Delta 9 THC is 0.12 CBD maximum is 0.01 percent CBD a is point film CVG is point eighty three and then CBD n is zero point 13 so not too many CBN's but very very strong indica mainly probably because of the blueberry on top of OD cush is also to dwell [ __ ] got some indica in that bit that is our guy cannabis but show you guys a little close-up shot of this cannabis right here so pretty try it out it's supposed to be blueberries so maybe a little purple oh yeah you guys see that little bit of purple right there hiding in hue so we ate it is it does have blueberry in it yep there's a purple right there guys let's bust the sucker open let's see what it looks like on the inside so I believe there's some purple up in here I do I do a little bit little bit not too much stuff not too much but there's a little bit of purple in there as you guys to see oh [ __ ] Ashton fell on it Ashton fell on oh [ __ ] drop it now drop it now alright but let's go on to get into the strain of you gonna do the small test the [ __ ] taste test in the high test get some up along guys alright let's get into the small test guys this blueberry chick that's a very interesting smell so we get some sweet rich pine almost some sweet key lime pie type of a smell some like really sweet key lime top smell Oh that'd be nice berry-berry super sweet skunk smell very interesting smell weed holy [ __ ] mixed up a little bit more trying to get all those smell there's a lot a lot of smiles up in this bin so yeah it's like sweet rich pine and then like a sweet key lime pie smell small like key lime pie and then a little hint on some sweet super sweet skunk like just really sweet [ __ ] that'd be very strong very loud package and [ __ ] very great smelling so straight up the small test of 5 out of 5 fire says sweet pine rich sweet rich pine sweet key lime pie and [ __ ] a little hint of sweet skunk well I guess that very strong berry la package a 5 out of 5 for the smell test guys so we got a bowl loaded up here into our og chill oh god nice a little bit of blueberry Kush up in here it's got you a quick greens taste test I guys toast Oh very interesting get a tiny tiny little hint of grape you get that sweet [ __ ] skunk that sweet pine and a little hint of that key lime pie type of taste this tastes the same way it smells but you have a little hint of like a little sweet grape taste in there like some grape soda so a green stays does the five out of five some amazing stuff very very sweet definitely a desert type of [ __ ] strain right here some tasty [ __ ] but wait a couple more hits here guys and then we'll tell you what it tastes like on the after greens taste it so the next hit I took out the green sage test was really good it taste is just like you know the first hit but then what you start getting third fourth fifth it it really starts to get a lot worse and like drops dramatically so dr. greens taste test I'm probably gonna give it a 3.5 out of 5 do you do so get a little hint of that sweet pine in there little hints of the sweet skunk you do you lose the grape used key lime pie face but you get a very strong already combusted wheat flavor in it so straight up I'll have to give you out there in CSS the 3.5 out of 5 just a little bit above average but definitely not up there's the part with good or even elite top-shelf [ __ ] taste so 3.5 out of 5 for the outdegree taste test know the high let's go ahead and take one more rip here but I like about this little ho g chill if it's perfect in my little 14 millimeter [ __ ] extension I don't get out to push down on her nothing just set it in there looks a little wobbly right looks like it's probably not airtight watch porks Burpee so the hi I'll definitely give the high of five out of five I'll load it just a little point warned up in here just look how much I have left just a little one point low point one and I'm already filling the fetch that'd be a very good strong CBD relaxing body high even though it's not technically a body high you know I feel very relaxed muscles feel very relaxed back feels a lot better amazing what it just did to my back because I was having [ __ ] you know horrible spinal pain [ __ ] or like you know back pain but you know up and down my [ __ ] spine and [ __ ] it really match that right there so it's really good for back pain I'll tell you that much good for you like I'd say you know your legs that [ __ ] like that needs definite load on my knees right up here my arms and [ __ ] like that and like in my elbows I do feel a little bit of pain you know I do have someone who suffers from a lot of [ __ ] body pain top to bottom alright but [ __ ] yeah but the most part really good CBD high [ __ ] I just off that little point one and a very relaxing sativa hedge height it's not very energetic you know it's something that something that you're gonna want to smoke and go out and go jog and go know do a bunch of activities throughout the day this is don't be something that you want to smoke after you get all your activities done for the day don't be something very relaxed and you can still be very functional you know I'm saying you just I definitely want to be jogging or running or anything like that beat up you sit there cost rate function I'm saying you need write stuff down and stuff like that but yeah don't be very good [ __ ] relaxing high so the high a 5 out of 5 like I said I chose good seed sativa high indica high it's just very relaxing it does take away some of the pain it's not the best for nausea and not the best for appetite but it does work I will say cuz I do feel a little bit hungry or I do a little say my stomach does still a little bit better but straight up yeah the high 5 out of 5 so my overall review of this blueberry [ __ ] Kush here I will have to give it you'll find out after this it I will give it a 4.5 out of 5 besides that after greens taste test this shit's really good it smells amazing tastes amazing in the first two three hits but like you said after that it really drops dramatically that means taste that's not the best but definitely very potent very strong very relaxing I wouldn't say couch launching if you smoked a couple balls you probably would get couch lock but definitely a very nice relaxing from head to toe relax them [ __ ] high CBD high with a good decent relaxing sativa high like I said but like I said I'll give this here a 4.5 out of 5 to dr. greens taste tester just a little bit better how to party give it a 5 out of 5 but besides that it is pretty much almost Topshop besides the after green teeth test take that away this is some top-shelf cannabis so I definitely recommend you guys to go to your medical records or even their black market wherever you go to get your cannabis set go see if you can get yourself some blue berry cush great night time

take care see y'all later deuce", "1PuK2PFwDc4": "hey everyone it's tech crazy today's video is going to be a review on can marx i believe that's the company name um mezzario blue vnm i guess that stands for blue venom blueberry mixed with white widow i got a half quarter as you can see i got it on sale um usually they don't put um products on still that much so i decided you know what i better run over and grab one and check it out while i can to save some money but uh anyways this video i'm gonna go a little more detail um i went right on the page for this where i where i usually order from and as you can see the prices are not always the same because sometimes they're sales sometimes they drop prices so if i were to put a price in a video uh maybe tomorrow would change and when you go to the store so i i just want to throw that out there most my ratings are on prices per quality so i'm going to rate this one considering the fact that it might be bit dry it might be dry flour and they gave me a sale price but i'm gonna i'm gonna try my best to give you a normal rating on it regardless i just wanted to point that out some of the strains i do get are on sale but i always show you the dates on them this one should have the date on it somewhere [Music] but it looks it packaged 22 may so this was packed a few months ago so this might be dry flour these bags i tend to dry out the flour uh pretty fast so let's go over it's uh based on its indica dominant heritage blue v nm typically produces buds that are both large and densely packed these with a dried flower range in color from army green and dark eggplant interwined and bright orange pistols the buds are covered in thick layer of trichomes a result of white widow liners blue venom is a fruity and aramic cultural whose unique terpene profile is dominated by the mercene humeline guolian and a lot of these words i've never even heard of um kind of lost on this description but uh limonene is also present here in specific qualities delivers uh tangy notes of citrus and mint some of these words i might want to look up down the road but let's see i'll get right into it um i got a 3 3.5 i got a half quarter [Music] there's the thc percentages uh i don't think these are very accurate i think they're a bit higher than they say like i've said it many other times once again this is a canadian government dispensary product i haven't opened let's go ahead and open it [Applause] i find these bags too rip it from both directions so that way you don't rip your seal and then uh end up with a a bag that's not sealed properly you kind of want to keep it in the same bag or you're going to lose its taste and flavor i'm going to do the smell [Applause] smells all right i i thought it was going to be like a dryer spicy smell because it was on clearance now this is one of their high end half borders so it should be good it smells really nice i won't even lie it smells kind of gassy and the can looks okay um [Applause] check out the buds okay so this is the half border i got as you can see it's a half decent half quarter um i don't know how i would show you their count so i'm going to start using my finger for the counts but there it is it's not bad i'm i'm gonna take a couple of pictures and i'll add it into the video i'm gonna go ahead and roll a joint and i'll throw that in the video as well and uh i'll give you the full review it does look pretty nice but i'm gonna give you a better uh picture with the with some nice lady i'll see you soon all right i'm gonna spark up the j i rolled up a nice size joint just like a a nice one paper except for the beginning of the day so i don't want to smell too much but let's give her let's give her a try for a sales price i think it tastes pretty good um i imagine it would taste a lot better if it was fresh not that it wasn't very fresh but it was i think these bags like i said dry it out really quick burning really good it's got like an aroma a blueberry i think the strongest i'm getting there's like a little it's got a little kick too i think that's the white widow the sweetness is definitely the blueberry i can almost taste the blueberry the first pull i could taste it this bud's a little bit dry so i'm getting a little bit of a dry taste i believe this is a indica dominant i was looking an indirect dominant heritage yeah i can feel it kind of already it's strong i took two pulls and it was pretty strong it's got like that white widow bite to it i think it was fresher it'd be much more enjoyable not that it's not enjoyable it's just i can really taste the dryness to it i save money though so i can't complain like i paid like half price but the buzz should be pretty much the same if not a little heavier for the fact that the trichomes had longer time to cure for the price it was fair it tastes all right the buzz is pretty good the buzz is kicking in pretty quick you know for the bus i give it like i give it like a four 4.2 you know what i mean it's pretty good buzz it's like hitting pretty quick it's not like hard with some of the streams i would give it a five where it's like bam you know like i'm stoned man holy [ __ ] i can't even smoke anything i can smoke this whole joint it went out now i usually do that in the videos i i sit there and hold it for like 10-15 seconds to see if it's going to continue to burn because a good joint will continue to burn it went out it's dry i didn't add tobacco nothing um i do what the end of the joint when i spark the joints so i don't canoe it as you see i'm way past the halfway point of the joint so i have nothing to do with that i imagine this was fresher would be a lot better for the price for quality i'd say it's a 4.2 as well i'm probably gonna rate this wheat overall 4.2 i can already tell the buzz the buzz is already like this buzz the more you smoke it the harder it gives you a couch lock [Music] i might get a little bit of caught mouth very little bit of cotton off not much i'll give you a little bit of eye drop too i feel my eyes like dropping a little bit see it went out as i was smoking so i don't know i'm gonna i'm gonna say right now i've i've had i've had indicates like this where you more you smoke them the more you get high i kind of thought that i was going to be like that because i've had white widows before where it's like don't roll too much of the white widow or the blueberry if you got stuff to do during the day because if you do you're gonna end up not doing it this weed might make me lazy i'm gonna go i'm gonna go an overall rating on this joint because i already know what the buzz is gonna be like for like how would i put it for it being a little bit draw drier and on clearance i'm going to give it a 4.1 i know i didn't pay much for it but on market value 25 half quarter i can get some pretty decent weed at twenty five dollars a half quarter two hundred dollars an ounce you know i can get some really nice wheat at that price definitely better than what i got here but um this this was really nicely dried and it's it's not bad these guys test their weed too i believe they do testing and they make sure there's like no mill to our mold so it's not bad it likes to go out it's not very resiny it's uh just likes to go out yeah i'm gonna stick with 4.1 thanks for watching uh any questions feel free to ask all

last time and this time we will be doing the cheese quick over here on the right so we did this two TV last night in the smell and the taste is a little weird different but the high was excellent lasted a good probably solid hour and it hit real fast so and a nice light body high energy high for sure so it was pretty cool eyes actually took a toke to go to bed and ended up staying up another hour working on my website so awesome it was good it's a excellent high here we got cheese quake it's their indica this was recommended to me by a Cameron I asked him to pick two of this farm so he chose it at an indica sativa and he gave me a cheesecake for the indica the stats are THC 22.7 1% CBD is point zero 4 CBC's 0.56 I don't know what that is but it's point zero 3 and a total of twenty-three point three four percent so harvest date was on February 1st of 16 package March 31st of 16 and this is one gram highway 420 out in Remington awesome shop if you're ever in there alright let's see what she tastes like smells like oh and that smells awesome it's nice skunky smell so you smell mmm that smells excellent it's a really nice funky smell there that's a great smell if I was doing the number ratings still I probably do that like I saw it eight and a half all right let's see what it tastes like Wow okay so it tastes skunky for sure and it expands like a mother Wow yes expansion okay so tastes good definitely got the same kind of scent you taste as it does smell but be careful when you hit it because it expands we'll take one more token come on back and there's the but up close pretty light not incredibly dense but kind of dense but decent for sure alright let's know the highest great smell a good look good taste Welbeck alrighty welcome back well cheesecake quake is a definite indica it's a pretty hard and fast and doesn't last too long but it's decent it smells good it tastes good it's a nice high but like I said it doesn't last too long I'm pretty heavy so indica I would say is a good description and this is the second from the double delicious so it's so far a pretty good farm so I've had to UM I had a sativa and indica both of them were nice and I would recommend him so if you're in the shop these were $14 grams definitely worth it excellent value see you next time", "HVfhX2_-r8I": "everybody welcome to Viper ahead TV I'm indica pine and this is my Stern review on UK cheese and um you didn't catch the bud before here's the bud um part of it I smoked already uh UK cheese is actually a phenotype of skunk number one it's not crossed with anything a phenotype is the the appearance the smell the taste kind of like our brown eyes is our phenotypes so if your mom has blue eyes and you don't you do carry the genotype of lies in your DNA sorry buck further confuse you some guy in the UK somewhere and decided that he wanted to grow bunches good number one right so one of the skunk number ones happen to have the smell or the appearance or the taste that he desired the most so he took that skunk number one and he bred it further and further and he artificially read it to carry this specific phenotype that the other skunk number once had but not as heavily not as prominently and the more he bred this type this phenotype with this phenotype um the farther away kind of got from being a skunk number one and once it became its own strain in its own it was named UK cheese so really simple explanation but if you kind of get the idea that's what a phenotype of skunk number watching um it has 52 twenty percent THC it isn't indica dominant hybrid though you do get a very amazing cerebral affect the buds are very compact very hairy resinous very crystalline and sticky and due to its indica heritage the cheese plant looks pale on with different shades of light green the effects of the plant are of the the flower are you foreign uplifting too great an antidepressant a very heavy body mount and it does have heavy couch lock effects so this this isn't something you want to smoke right before work it is great for pain joint pain muscle pain it's good for anxiety stress panic attacks paranoia really good for insomnia people that have issues sleeping again help your depression also headaches it's good for my head to turn my headache um it has a musky skunky cheese outer and when broken heart it almost sounds like a very edge the taste is slightly cheesy on kind of woody on inhale but really musky on exhale the skunk taste lingers not much else I really know what to say but um that's my straighter view on UK cheese

Tea. Gage. Muchuacan, Maui-Wowie. Acapolco Gold. Panama Red. Purple Haze. Skunk Number One. Northern Lights Number Five. Williams Wonder. Chocolope. Supersilver Haze. In late September, Oregon and their Cannabis Control Commission decided to ban the use of particular terms when marketing cannabis strains to adults via retail. Their concern being that some of them might be mistaken for other drugs, not that we have an illegal LSD market or an illegal GreenCrack market, but those names have been wiped out. Or that they reference things that might be thought of as fun for children or appealing to kids, such as Grape Ape, which was a cartoon that\nwent off the air in 1978. I remember watching it, I was ten. Which means that the person who is most likely to recognize Grape Ape for being a cartoon character is in their forties or older. A lot of people are worried and the funniest damn thing is that the codes that are gonna be recognized by children, the adults won't\nrecognize. Kids use different words than their parents do to describe things that they don't want their parents to know they're talking about. Duh. So, what we did with regard to naming cannabis, we gave it a whole bunch of different names because it was under prohibition. But if you look at how these names changed over time, first it was ganja and cannabis, the broader hemp type of broader, generic\nterm for the plant. And then we start decarboxylating in the West. We start taking tetrahydrocannabinolic acid, we loosen the carbon dioxide molecule from it, we render it into a psychoactive substance, THC, and that THC then is volatilized; \nturned into a vapor of a sort, inhaled, crosses through the lungs, the capillaries, crosses the blood brain barrier, goes into the brain, the cannabinoids attach their \nnatural receptors in the brain and you feel high! (YAY) And, once we started doing that, people started going to 'Muggles' and 'Mez' and 'Tea' and 'Reefer.' Particular references because you couldn't call it cannabis or hemp because the law was starting to crack down on those things and then, suddenly, in the 1960's, 30 years after prohibition, there's this massive explosion\nof the retail wholesale global retail cannabis market. And global importers want to set their products apart from others so they start identifying the regions, the nations the cultures the\nlocations where their plants are coming from. 'Jamaican Lambsbread' is different from\n'Durban Poison' which is different from 'Thai Stick.' So these become means by which you identify strains, they become commonly known, they enter into the lexicon. You can find them in Cheech and Chong films, you can find them in comedy albums,\nNational Lampoon and other stuff they talk about 1970's into the 1980's. And, then we get into the 1980's and the drug war\nand all of a sudden the penalties from importing and the risk of importing \nbecome much greater, the problems with cultivating outdoors in\nthe domestic United States becomes more difficult with fly-overs\nthat continue to this day, 30 years later. So, much of our cultivation for cannabis\nfor the sake of producing psychoactive flower tops was moved indoors. And when you move it indoors, now it doesn't\nyou don't have what's known as the 'Terrroir.'  You don't have the locale, you don't have\nthe land race, ecology and climate that you would find in Panama or in Colombia. Instead, you have a grow room and grow room, well, the lights are set on timers, \nand the humidity is controlled, carbon dioxide levels are controlled, \nthe nutrient drip is controlled. Everything, as much as possible is under\nhuman control. So, a grow room in New York City and a grow\nroom in Amsterdam and a grow room in Los Angeles and a grow room in Tokyo and a grow room in, in, wherever, Bali, will more or less produce similar growing conditions. And therefore the genetic trait of whatever\nof that strain is will be expressed more or less uniformly. So that's when we see the names shift into\nmore esoteric things like 'Williams Wonder' and 'Northern Lights' and 'Skunk' and\n uh, 'Kush' and things like that. Now we've moved into another realm where we\nnow have the commercialization of regulated market. The state is now stepping in saying\nwhat you may and may not call your product. That's part of regulation. It's part of bringing the market above\nboard. and the states concern, whether it's misplaced\n(as this is) or if it's legitimate, the states concern is real and they have the authority. So, you will not be able to market\n'Green Crack' or 'Bruce Banner' any longer or 'Grape Ape' any\nlonger in Oregon under the current rubric. You will be able to rename it; you can ask\nyour budtender, \"hey, you got any Green Crack?' and the budtender'll say, \"yeah, sure, we've\ngot some of that right over here, it's GC.\" Right? Just call it the 'GC.' \nOr call it 'Oregon Ape.' Because we can't call it 'Grape Ape' on the\nreceipt, we'll just call it 'Oregon Ape.' Everybody knows 'Oregon Ape' is just \n'Grape Ape' given the Oregon name. So, that's where we're moving now. And, of course you have the branding. Willie's weed, Snoop's weed, uh, who else, uh... all of them. Everybody who's gonna have their own strain,\nuh, those strains are their own strains of cannabis that could've been called something\nlike 'Hollywood Kush' but instead it's name is 'Snoops.' Or it's named after Willie or it's\nnamed after Melissa Etheridge or somebody like that. And that's where we're going. We're gonna see much more direct\ncommercialization of product. These names we've come to know and love\nover the past 25 or 30 years are still gonna stick around in the lexicon,\njust like 'Reefer', just like 'Tea', just like 'Gage', but they're not gonna be as common. People are gonna start to become more proprietary\nwith the genetics and you will see, um, perhaps less appealing, just simply, \"This is the Seed Company and this is #22.\" And that's what you get. You get, you ordered #22.\n#22 is an indica sativa hybrid that's got a high concentration of THC, it's got\nabout a .2 % CBD, it's got a nice pinene terpene profile with a lot of mercene in it. That's what people are gonna be buying in\nthe future, the differentiation between high-grade\ncannabis is very small. Yes, there are connoisseurs and connoisseurs will\nbe able to tell the difference. like with fine wine they can tell the difference\nbetween a Malbec and a --pick another-- Pinot. They they do it by scent, they do\nit by appearance, they can do it by texture. Cannabis users, the advanced cannabis\nusers can do that. Most cannabis users will not just. Just like\nmost tobacco users don't differentiate between, aside from the brand of cigarette. Most beer drinkers don't really differentiate\nmuch besides the style of beer. Most people who consume other products; \norganic, agricultural products don't really differentiate between this apple and that\napple in any grave degree.

anyways it's the next time these", "tEiB7EikRws": "I've smoked how you doing so is Wednesday is that time of the week again for another strain review and today we're going to be taking a look at that freakish this kind of restraint is amazing so I've had this now for a few days to sitting there waiting to be reviews it's like a quick little join out of it just so I can see what it tasted like it looks beautiful so I will show you what that looks like and we will smoke some of it as well and let you know how the effects of it it is a powerful indica known for its pain relieving the facts excited to review this for you guys and abut that I've got is almost soft wrapped around itself which is orange hairs I looked out from Leafly and that's in the genetics and it is pretty much purple really strong purple colors running through the whole but there's so much so but when you grind this up in the grinder it seems more purple than green which is fantastic and it just shows you the diversity of the wonderful cannabis strains though blackberry Kirsch is one to look out for if you want something different I have recently read that you can force canvas to change color when there's flowering when it's growing by subjecting it to different conditions this is one of the strains where it's actually in the genetics to be purple so worth noting that it is really different to most of the stuff that I have tried Wow so you get the earthy cushy smell coming through but you also get really fruity notes which obviously is partially the reason they're called it black berry coach almost the aftertaste of a ripe [ __ ] that sort of smell will get to me is what it smells like let's talk about the true job on this bit of but there are bits of popcorn leaf still dying around in this but however when you see a close-up of this and you see just how covered in crystals they are you can see why I mean this little bit Salif here to pick off that will go into the I smoke jar which will be turned into cannabutter but that's a lot of time to build up and these little strands and lift weight nets and nothing so you're not really losing out when you pick up a bit of bundle it's got its leaves on like that obviously it's not the sort of level you see with dispensaries are in America but for somebody is sort of grown this themselves as a project that is a great bit but and the development of the crystals and the formation of the button attest to that as well we're going to do a separate video at some point where we talk about the different colors of cannabis ranging from purple to green to black to red hues as well there's all different colors everything in between all the different shades within the cannabis plant and it's a lot rarer than the green so it's great to see genetics where that is shining and you can tell that it's not your everyday beer but according to Leafly blackberry Kirsch is a mostly indica strain mix of Afghani and battery strains it's got dark purple buds as we know with orange hairs a plants flower at between seven and eight weeks and on particularly high Yildiz which probably explains why you don't see more blackberry here it's not gonna be commercially viable to grow them unless you're doing it for yourself blueberry Kush tends to have a hashey jet-fuel smell definitely smell that and a taste that is balanced by the sweet berries and is often recommended the treatment of plain that thanks to the strong indica body effects so the things that this is gonna make you feel called into literally are relaxed sleepy happy euphoric and hungry do check out your Bible to see you can see on leafy that's always a good brief what we can do now is we are going to cover the taste and we're gonna roll a joint of the blackberry cush and show you how it smoked is the art smoke probably box probably pure as we do six days strong smoking no tobacco and absolutely loving it [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I'm sure that that's gonna make me feel ready kids a nice indica wake up in the morning just got in from having a blackberry cush and wow it is a fantastic tasting bit but really really sweet that indica higher is starting to kick it now because I smoked it pure I find that there's a little bit of a lag and I start to feel the effects probably about 10 minutes later which is a little bit slower than when I used to smoke it in this blue with tobacco but for being healthier it's a much better option I am feeling good and relaxed and nice and chilled out it was my first one of the day so I'm not mashed although I'd normally stick to sativas in the morning I can definitely see the medicinal benefits of a string like this when you wake up especially if you're in any kind of pain or if you feel in sort of like you need to relax it's blackberry Kosh strain is a great option under night I forgot my hat in it and it went hi great London big up guys and gives gives to me rock in kinda friendly businesses here in the UK so I've been Tyler green check back next Wednesday for another straight review we release videos three times a week Monday Wednesday and Friday make sure you subscribe to I smoke on YouTube

you with another flower review today I've got my hands on some revolution Kentucky bluegrass which is a cross of blueberry and huckleberry Kush without further ado let's get to the categories and check this bud out interestingly this stuff really does have a little bit of blue coloration when the light hits it at the right angle that's probably attributed to the blueberry genetics or maybe even the huckleberry cush genetics I could see either having some blue to purple coloration depending on the phenotype and you know the expression of that but the stuff looks really good it might be slightly leafy ER than other revolution strains and slightly less dense but it still looks fantastic it's unbelievably sticky the cures really good so I'm gonna give it an 8.5 out of 10 for looks this flower has a pungent sour floral aroma and then beneath that there's undertones of sour blackberries it's got a very interesting smell it's not these strong is smelling in terms of like the volatility could be a little stronger but it smells fantastic when you break the nugs open I'm gonna give it an 8.5 out of 10 for smell as well the smell of this flower didn't translate incredibly well to the flavor in my personal opinion it was a little more of a dry herbal flavor then the smell led me to believe it would be it still seems cured really well because the smoke was super smooth it just didn't retain as much flavor so I'm gonna give it a 7 out of 10 for flavor in many different sessions with this flower I found it consistently to be very sedating and relaxing and oftentimes it put me right to sleep I would smoke it right before going to bed and it made my eyes heavy and helped me sleep on a cloud this is very good for relaxation doesn't do as much for generating novel ideas if you're looking for a flower to help you with that but it's extremely relaxing especially on a psychological level I felt like I was very mentally relaxed which i think makes for a good recipe for sleep often times even if it doesn't provide you as much of a body hi in this case the supreme relaxation can help you fall into a nice peaceful rest so I'm gonna give it a 9 out of 10 for the effects I really did like medicating with this stuff so that's gonna give this flower a composite value of eight point two five out of ten which is very solid stuff I would definitely recommend trying this stuff if you're looking for something that'll help you relax sort of quiet your mind a little bit but that's all I got to say today stay safe everybody and let me know if you've tried this stuff in the comments if your experiences are similar or different and if there's any other products I should be checking out right now", "CxypGt6qXTQ": "hey what's going on is that premium cannabis coming at you with another weed Wednesday garden update this week in Doris were still fighting the spider mites the predator mites I released last week they did some work but I guess it just wasn't enough it was supposed to be enough for three thousand square feet however this is obviously not that and it didn't work so my thinking is Amazon kind of messed up and maybe not all of them came live so step two we're gonna get some ladybugs in here so I'm pretty sure I took down some plants that were horribly infested and I replaced them with these two that just came into flower now on the far left I believe they're both mento dope not one is blue cheese but either way they're doing good I sprayed them in veg to take care of the spider mites so hopefully none will be transferred over to the flower room from these guys in particular looking good not too much going on here these are just cleaned up ready to go into flower to begin their journey and moving on we see that the next ones we're looking at are starting to really get a lot of pistols so that's good news the thing is you still see spider mites here and there so I've been going through and selectively taking the leaves that have the most damage to try to minimize the amount of spider mite damage and presence in the room I'm going to probably have to take more plants down however it'll be okay the ones I do take down I can use for hash or something and unfortunately you know it's a it's a it's a loss there's no way around it but that's just the way to deal with spider mites if you hear for spider mite advice here it is cut down your guard and reset clean it not everyone can afford to do that but that's the way to do it that's the correct way to fight spider mites in my opinion in my experience spending time and resources fighting them is just like a waste of time because they are just so prevalent and staying alive and reproducing and hiding in places where you wouldn't even think to look so if you're looking for advice that's what I say to do I'm not going to do that because I can't afford to right now with the way things are going also figures me an opportunity to kind of experiment with different spider mite preventative measures and fighting tactics so we're gonna make this kind of a learning experience and make it make the best of the situation everything's going pretty good as you can see this Mendo dope looks great however what those coal is is having a hard time I don't know what's going on here it doesn't look like there's spider mites on the leaves so I don't think that's what's causing it but it's super weird that it's just that top cola and like the top half of the cola and then it starts to get thick on the way down but it's all this is the same plant here and that one goal is just not developing I don't know what happened so it's a it's a very unique Nichola right there but overall this method Oh looks okay and I think I might have to take this one out because I see more spider mites than I'd like to so that might be a bummer but this big girl over here I think she'll be sticking around to finish up because they don't seem to be too crazy on this one so this is good because this one's nice and trico mean look at the frost and the hair is this am endo dope free fire phenotype beautiful beautiful Phoenix I've got crazy orange terpenes your new with the men you'll know soon enough that the orange terpenes are crazy especially on this phenotype of pre-fire a phenotype has like the orange peel not the orange inside like a lot of Tanja's you smells so it's a pretty interesting Turk fra Turk profile excuse me and I'm really lucky to be able to grow this one nice big coal as you can see next to my thumb there got a decent way to go so we still got a chunk up some but as far as like sighs I think this is getting there get into the finishing lines here and like I said this one before was having issues so this is probably a half plant but it's still Mendo dope so it's gonna be some damn good hash probably turned some of this into rosin as well don't want to press rosin since I reset my room and without having any trim or anything to make hash with it's a bummer because I just haven't I've been looking at my press for the past like two months now so getting excited gearing up for harvests I know this solar flare is gonna be great the buds are so dense and it makes really nice hash and also some of these leaves might be good on some canna gars I think I mentioned that last week what that'd be awesome if we could get those into some canon gar wrappings because they look really beautiful it's like a orange sunset and the beach of Tahiti both this and the blue cheese are coming to an end these are the first two that were put in here so the rest are at least a week or more behind so these are gonna be the first ones however I think I am gonna cut them a little early just because the spider mites are so prevalent on the blue cheese I don't know if I'm gonna zoom in here on any leaves in particular but they are there and they are hungry and as you can see blue cheese is havin nutrient problems as well so I think it just might be an all-around better way to utilize the space is to just take it down and and and not deal with the problems and just try to fix all that spider mite stuff in that area maybe clean it up before moving any other plants over there because we just want to make sure that this whole flower room is on point and can't do that if you have an infected plant so as you can see the trichomes are nice starting to get density at the last two weeks of its life here I think so not bad and a little corn fell shook it up make sure to throw those spider mites around oh wow it's gonna make some good hash those blue cheese is a very nice sativa I know blue cheese indica dominant strain over this is a sativa dominant phenotype so a lot of people like this and I'm excited to work with it sue we have come with the can of caps you know the can of gars all that stuff this may be the most full we see this room in the next few weeks if we have to take down most of these plants because of those issues like I said it might be the best thing to do but it's worth it at the end because of all the problems that come with it so looks good though it definitely looks good full just gonna make sure you keep everything on point clean up all your fans your surroundings your ground the walls I should have that plastic over the walls but I just don't have enough funding or time to do that right now but it's definitely on the list and it's not gonna be completely sealed either way as you can see it's just plastic with tape on the wall so spider mites are bound to get in here I knew it was gonna happen I was prepared for the fight I bought all the stuff that I needed but now that we're here it's a whole other challenge now you might remember last week veg was looking pretty bushing so I went through and when I took those other two plants into flower I cleaned everything up I made sure they looked nice and pretty taken care of and he infected spider mite leaves out of there and they gave him a nice spray with some very good stuff that I got at the gross store and everything looks good I had trimmed up and tops pretty much all of the phones some of them I went extreme because I want them to grow slower so I'm trying to manipulate the growth cycle here by D leafing and stuff I'm trying to utilize the little things that happen when do that like the stresses of bounce back to growth to kind of postpone their growth make it work for me so starting on the far left here we have blue cheese and then a row of solar flare and pretty much everything on the right side for the past four rows I think his Mendel dope so we had a lot of men dodo make sure to keep it around like I said everything was nice and trimmed up and tops you could see it here and hopefully a lot of these are gonna be ready for flowers soon after I translate that into bigger pots although I'm thinking if I need to take out a lot of those bigger plants in there and the flower room because of spider mites I might want to do one round of smaller pots and just flour them out in small pots so I can get more of a plant count in to make up for lost time with what the plants I'll be losing so it's something to think about we'll see you next week what ends up happening but I made sure to take plenty of clones when I topped everything we got clones from the nine pound hammer now the Candy Jam as well as the Stifler's mom from telekinetic genetics so I'm excited to see the Turk profile when they go into flower and if I'm gonna end up keeping them round because they all seem like really dank strains so I've only heard good things from all of them and you're gonna come on the journey with me stick around the next few weeks and let's see what happens you got all the regular clones as well the blue cheese solar flare and mentos dope so that brings their total plant count and I'll strain count in the garden excuse me up to six so that's pretty exciting I definitely have a lot that I want to try so I'm kind of hoping one of them maybe doesn't make it or isn't as good as I want it to be so I can get something else in there but I think that's every growers dream is to just pop as many seeds as you want just start being a hunting and figure out what you like so anyways thank you guys so much for hanging out with me this week this has been an indoor garden update in the Zen premium cannabis make sure you follow my Instagram if you want to see way more frequent content I'll take good pictures and post them sometimes we get a good bond trip all right nice video of the garden so check it out let me know what you think and as always guys happy growing peace", "kUOCSjxwOXc": "okay so do another video right now in the strain that I got for today is that a new dream really wonderful strain this is a sativa dominant hybrid it's 80/20 80% sativa and it's blueberry cross with super Silver Haze so two really good genetics on this I actually grew this back in 2012 this is the first clone I picked up when I came there as alright so yeah but this is my first time buying this from a dispensary so it's a really restraint the nugs they're like you know popcorn but they're super dense they're really sweet they got a really fruity berry who buying this when you break it up when you get down in there it's a really wonderful taste and it's a it's got a great smell great bag appeal this is good for pain the pain relief lasted maybe about two and a half hours kind of short but the high is wonderful the high is strong for about the first hour but after that you got like maybe two and a half maybe even three hours of this this hazy buzz that kind of lingers around it some of those high all day and that's good because when that pain kind of comes back it's not a big deal not when your dad hi you know if you feel the pain but it's not a problem it's not a concern you know you know it's there but you do it it's it's just no problem so that's what I really like this strain um I thought it was long lasting total pain relief because I was able to go without medicating for a longer amount of time so um really great the high is very energetic its uplifting very cheerful happy euphoric get the giggles you laughing you're talking you're open you're sociable it's good for anxiety and someone else the red stress fatigue pain and I also read it's good for nausea seizures bipolar disorders and ADHD and yeah I was like man this is a really feel-good strain this is something that you could probably medicate with all day long no crash if munchies though did a bit of coughs lungs gonna burn in there ooh that's a tasty smoke and yes I would definitely buy this again I picked this up from healthful life Mesa East actually got it both locations but it was 11 bucks a gram so I think wow that's a good deal and it was really strange", "JI0L1JB8m50": "case maybe so today we are going to be reviewing confidential cookies it's a 70 30 indica hybrid it actually i have our hair look at it you know let's start with this i was going to do that before i started the video but i need to re-center my camera now here we go that's right follow into my comments holy crap there we go okay so we got this from halo this flower and concentrate dispensary this is what the concentrate looks like so that's what we have it kind of has a little bit of a pungency to it but not not much so this is the halo branding i actually like their halo branding it's kind of nice as long as you know i don't have stickers all over the place and you can actually see the branding but i mean it does a nice thing it has the indicative and hybrid so it can be marked on the on the uh package itself but what would be very nice is for you to put a little strip of something down here to where we could write the name of it or we could figure out a way to do it that way just so that we if our meds get mixed up we know where they go because i've actually done that and i've had a couple of people talk to me about it lately lately so that's kind of how we do it and then what we do is we take and we write so like this is a 70 30 indica so i'll write 70 slash 30 with an eye on it and that's how we classify it for how i classify it so let's heat this finger up and do it i hope you guys are having a great day it is mid-afternoon i'm like where'd that go so my camera is like drooping

know it's potent um it burns the back of my throat really bad and i'm guessing that's from the spicy herbaly sweet that's in it you do taste a little bit of the sweet but you taste more of the sour um but i mean the taste itself is not very good it's kind of kind of yucky so um but effect the tongue tied now but you feel the effects fairly quickly so the first place i feel them is around my eyes you feel like you're wearing a mask or something there's like a pressure that kind of a gentle pressure that kind of goes around your eyes and then you'll kind of feel it go down into your neck and ears and behind your ears and behind your neck and then it kind of drapes around it's nice and relaxing it's comfortable it's one of those for a rainy day to kick back with your you know your hot cocoa or your coffee and just chill so this is confidential cookies it is a 70 30 indica hybrid um the parent strings on this are confidential cheese and dream cookie stage this strains this is a very thick stable shatter it's not sticky um i can pick it up and drop it it it doesn't really shatter when you do that it stays together but it's not really up snap and pull because it doesn't pull at all um this celebrity child has a potent high and long lasting effects she is best suited for experienced smokers the high starts with a rush of cerebral effects invading your mind and leaving you

so I'm gonna do a really quick make this quick so I separated a couple that I'm showing the mail it's not gonna show up on my camera for you they're pretty small they're just pre Fowler is pretty much but the rest are showing pistols besides this one obviously isn't showing at all I might just get rid of that and then this one isn't for some reason the blueberry blue cheese from new kids it's not showing because it's it's really very good now in my national for long good branches I'm sure if you can see the crystals but it's definitely showing that's one that's the most prevalent one these ones have and do have that this is my personal strain that I made it's a heavy heavy end because it grows short and squat like a book that's this is the phenyl that I love right here and then this is the other phenol that I love and this one grows this phenol girl is like huge fan leans but then like sure I don't know I just it's very cool like look at that and that's showing female to then this one is like this one I had under the scroll kinda so it's kinda like messed up but this one's kind of show I think it's showing female so it's still a little early it's only been seven days under twelve twelve so I'll see in a couple more days but I just don't have the room like bird and something's going on like a lot of the leaves down the bottom of the other way so I got to figure out what is going on here I just don't have the room for these two and they're they're showing that they're showing three flowers and they're they're pretty much man likes they really turned up there's no pistol there they're hard to tell but they look like they look like sacks so I just I just want to give these guys I still don't have no and that's why I kind of want to get rid of that one so am i bringing over my blood he's probably going to actually ferry guys I will catch you later I just wanted to do a quick video shout out to each LG grow lights for the quantum board this thing is filling it by perspective my bi perspective throughout they're probably gonna lower remember yet I might cut some families this one we'll see I feel like it could use it just forget get some more light at least over here but everything's like friggin blocked by them basically but we'll see see once we get some buds hopefully soon that's why I like this phyno like a cake this is not for our nutri do this this is had since it was born it's got two-tone leaves and it's had that since I was born just on this one side a couple of them pretty damn cool though it's definitely something wrong it's a it's not PA - checked all the pH pretty sure I don't know because I pretty much maintained I'm pretty good with the Newt trying to think what that could be nitrogen maybe I don't know we'll see alright guys so", "xe7vZw0Mx7Q": "hey i'm back time for another review today's review is of spinach white widow the indica dominant hybrid and i got my thing here loaded up ready to go total thc is 22.8 also looking at the white widow review on the lyft.co website and it's saying this frosty anytime hybrid is known for its woodsy and floral aromas yes definitely woody definitely floral comes from the strains my syringe whatever found in mango lemongrass hops in time and cure filing and sorry i don't know these words using a bunch of fancy words carol filing and a little little turpin profile what the hell white widow wow i mean exhale i got a very spicy flavor to it white widow is reported to produce a cheerful soothing conversational effect i don't know these all just say hybrid so none of them say in the cursitiva dominant so it's kind of like i have to ask to make sure that's what i'm getting because i asked for it any kid dominant [Music] yeah this is like the second or third or fourth spinach the strain that i've tried and they're all pretty good what's it just kind of like the name spinach doesn't like scream weed when you see this if you just saw this you might not immediately think this weed also my first blaze of the day though 3 30. i don't normally place this early yet but i'm not just reading people's reviews it's kind of funny packs a big punch for a small price big high for a little money great but gave me crazy munchies this is a great for getting buzz but not safe for your fridge i don't know i've never really noticed different strains making me more or less hungry it's like any strain i try i get hungry no matter what's trying to try i'll it'll make me hungry gently i've never really had anyone that was like not made me hungry as you can see my cat went into the cupboard for no reason because there's nothing i've never heard white widow in general is like a pretty good strain people it's a well-liked strain white widow has been described as among the most popular strangers in the world this is what wikipedia is saying now hybrid percentage was interesting i never really like looked up what google says when you just you just google the strain itself not with spinach just saying white widow and even right here there's like things on the side of the screen that show you stuff higher classification hemp origin netherlands hybrid percentage brazilian sativa plus south indican south indian indica scientific name cannabis sativa plus indica white widow i just ate something so i wonder if they'll make me want to eat again but i don't really need to there's my session and it was my first session of the day so so you know it's got a bit of a heaviness but nothing but nothing but not too bad that you won't can't do anything like if you wanted to do stuff after this to still be good if you wanted to chill out or go outside it's a nice relaxing high i mean it's indica dominant so it's not going to make you crazy energetic like i still feel almost as chill as i was before i just have a head high now that was a good one though white widow spinach about this at sweet tree cannabis on seventeenth ave my first time going there [Music] you gotta say that right next to papa john's pizza or something maybe it's not even there anymore i don't know but it's next to like a circle's k or whatever good place i go there again they got like a returning customer point system so that's cool so anyways get some white widow and have a nice chill high", "eoh_X_NXcvU": "hello I wrestle SOS here and today I've just

"CqFiucWKo-8": "[Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Music] yeah that's a blend these are the last this one is mallanna Valley [Music] [Music] it doesn't drop from your finger so sticky this it's it's incredible and so intense dorama you can smell in it that the mountains you can smell a little bit of resin from pine trees a little bit it's so complex is incredible the place in India where we are going in the mountains it's famous for its charas how is it made this is one of the reasons that we have gone to this place is this this is one of the few places in the world where they make the hash from live plants this is the best cream produced in the Malaya's and we're gonna make sure that when we come back we will bring back with us the knowledge the precious knowledge and frankerz alone and that many other people have about that area about this kind of quality this is this is cannabis cup winner quality stuff for me is very interesting and very nice but to go back in India and to work to make something for this plant because I told you for me here's my life [Music] [Music] the Indian expedition started with a really cool trip from Amsterdam after a great dinner and a good night's sleep we went to the airport board the KLM flight and in eight hours we were in India fortunately our great friend Simon was waiting for us in Chokey came all the way from Africa and it's always a surprise to people arrived on time or not we travel long distances to meet each other and communication is quite difficult sometimes it was really a cool experience and a cool thing to find him there waiting for us [Music] [Music] at the temple there was a ceremony going on so in in our honor and in honor of the shiva god of charas we witnessed this ceremony [Music] also very important these traditional cultures here in India was a suggestion from our shared by her Chapel we also decided to offer a goat to the gods for our well-being into the mountains and it was pretty amazing three unique quite intense experience you could really feel the vibration of something special in the air is church' see that this is church Wow the first ones in India because of the resin a man among these are these are the original colour scenes man look look at this green one this one yellow this one here lemon haze what do you think about all the females there's only female sir yes larkey this male are not good 100% Greeners feminized quality no doubt in the Himalayas this is gonna be a nice smoke in the Himalayas as well as in Africa this one performs well everywhere this plane it's full seizure [Applause] [Applause] [Music] we arrived in the morning in the pool and the first thing we did of course is smell and taste some culture of the area so we decided to have a little walk on the market a very colorful market little beautiful clothes and people and kind of circus young children doing things that you can question if it's good or not but this is India if you compare to Europe it's incredible so the prices and the labor and the people are working there you see the ice cream vendors with there is no patents little cars [Music] [Music] the service festival is a festival they make to remember the victory of the god Rama against the devil was living in Sri Lanka and who raped his wife Sita hundreds of thousands of people they will come because he are in any village there is a different God so in this particular day all the God will go in Kulu we got on the main square and all these gods these personifications of gods came running through the streets parading through the streets and the army was there an incredible amount of soldiers thousands of gods come together also our god shiva the ganja god the festival was really colorful was something that for me it was unique to see also because you can feel the culture how it pregnant the life of the people here it was a big riot in yet but it was beautiful to be a part of this festival [Music] my Indra in India is like a classical if you drive around you see thousands of these old minder Jeeps and for us it was really nice to be able to drive and get the feeling of the real India on the road compared to other countries where we are able to get a bit more modern and a bit more efficient for by force actually it was a little bit of a step back but we adapt and we move on and we drive on after a few hours in the car we reached the bottom of Milano Valley and that's where the walk begins and the walk is pretty steep immediately it starts with a good session all the way up to 2700 meters and that's where the the incredible character galilean our lives ha ha we walked up to Gagne know an Italian man who was living for 24 years on that mountain is one of this crazy hippie character who lives in his own world but he creates something very special and very magical around him and he knows a lot about hand rubbing and making cherish he grows on vegetables he lives in his own monoculture nearly there he's got all different kinds of things and he made also very nice woolen sweater for me for in the cold yeah perfect fit Kiki he decided to come here and to forget this [ __ ] new one Jelena was pure poetry unbelievable to find him living the inspirational at his age in so strong and healthy smile and a sucker all that counts for him is writing poetry smoking good chairs in the Chilam and having positive vibes and positive energy with the people and the animals and the plants around you [Music] [Applause] Ultra can totally change to create a glioma team so meeting with a salesman at the poco team is no patent alpha means that there are in the morning time now this is the swinging of the bed night but is not only this because I had forgotten smoking five six joint at least Audrina [Music] [Applause] [Music] we decided to camp on 2700 very close to where Franco have lived for a very long time in HK but I think I could have shot each other he told me about the cave many times but when you see it in person and it's really incredible you see this place the view alone is out of this planet and you think so peaceful so magical with plants around fields around a small community of mountain people with which are very welcoming and very friendly the locals they told me there was a house they are broken they told me you take stones and wood and you'll fit it and they a they fit it when did you came here 96 96 how many years did you live good ten years first time I was in this area it was in 91 then I was amazed from desimilus really then in 94 I had the trouble in Italy so he had my strains I decided to give them a chance in the spring of 96 I was here asking to the locals it was possible to give them some chance they told me yes you can do it then I started on living here but it I realized was not only for this all these kind of life is so interesting like see the original hand way of making cherish Rabbinate rubbing it the big difference with Morocco is where the dry the plants but here you have to do all alive we decide to build the base camp there because after that we could walk for another few hours up to 3,000 2,200 so very special fields and these fields are amazing the genetics they are actually a very very special because you can see many phenotypes of the same kind of bland rice that generates this incredible charros and incredible cream and in the same field you can see purple plants you can see sweet flower plants you can see real sativas with a minty piney woody smell and a very very nice variation so very interesting from a plant point of view also thank you a whole day to make one Tola it will be very difficult now to make one Tony on one day maybe half dollar no maybe six seven grams maximum seven grams the taller and India's 10 grams so now they make six seven grams in the afternoon one food at work imagine [Music] camping is a strain hunter is also a little bit different experience than than people imagine because of course the kind of time and time frame you have is always very short you have to set up tent at the end of the day and leave your camp very early in the morning so you don't have much time to prepare much to ether you just have time to make a nice big fire that we always take care of doing because it's safe and gets you warm it's very important [Music] traveling from Malaya to India is obviously quite a shock and massive differences obviously in terms of altitude and terrain and also in terms of half people plant in Malawi you'd find this tiny little field hidden miles and miles away really like a needle in the haystack whereas in India you really just hit that Ganges everywhere [Music] after the gay we get moving get moving until we finally reach the top fields Franco showed us how the original cream is made now and this is something the foreigners brought in like 15 years ago because it used to be on insurance and now they also make curry misses a high quality with less particulars of the planting like nowhere has and no calyxes and wood and for us it was also very big learning experience to see from which area the best cream of West Charles come what we really saw is that the higher you get the higher the quality of the cream gets and also the more indica the plant gets this is the field how many plants are here so the plants we have to shoot to choose they should be a ripened but not fully ripened they should have not one dry point of the little leaves also in crema we all sat in a circle and franca started teaching us how to make the perfect hand of Charles and the perfect and looks cream and it was just incredible we just sat there in the Sun it was such a beautiful day with this crispy mountain air and we started rubbing rubbing rubbing so the hands are totally clean nothing on the hands no cream not nothing the hands must be in his son would Franco explain to us the better the face went from the Sun cause it's a long hot day then slowly rugged plants in the manicure first one by one some people they were cleaned all before altogether but they will start to let some juice if you play not before it's better for better quality is better to clean one by one wrapping in the Himalayas King this is pretty cool the stem you should take away then bud we put in the ends and you start we start to a caress it very gently very slowly and without pressure we just must to feel it to rub in your hand in your palms with a very fingers without breaking anything look already you see they're stitching this big yes we take these two big yes is better to make two little together when you strip it you don't make like this because this now this will take away the tears from your eyes we try to take to let it the big piece on your finger so don't know bigger it is like this piece you will lose it okay you take it or leave a finger you have to you have to press you have to have bigger it is looking more text okay yes and more it takes away [Music] [Music] [Applause] so after walking down rushing down the mountain we reached the village of mallanna there is now a road going down there but before you had to walk like 2020 for cash together like two days now because of all the dams that are building in this area it's easy to access but still it's a very pretty steep climb up to the village and once you are in the village you are in a totally different world [Music] hey guys [Music] these guys are probably the direct descendants of Alexander the Great's troops lefting is in this area during the conquering of Asia you cannot touch the people you cannot touch the houses we're not allowed to eat with them this place was very hidden in the mountain and divorce is related everything they they need they get from the mountain okay so they the way they build their houses without nails the wood even the stones for the roof and vodka castle only tells us that in all the times there are only two things that people needed was salt and oil Franco can you ask the guy for bottle of water here we cannot to go inside the shop because there's an eatable of items so they will come unpure they was letting a few SEC's of wool they were going away and the locals from down looking how many and changing with salt and rice and going away and the mulana people they was going and taking wood no even look in the other in the last hundred years or in the last 150 years Cera's has replaced wool as a form of barter so these mountain people live this life totally self-sufficient and they use Cera's to buy the few things that they can't obtain from the mountain to see mulana people there was really another confirmation of the fact that cannabis is integrating part of the most special cultures on this planet Cera's is people's freedom in these areas ok tomorrow after meeting you in may after your all your problems we had decided to give you a beautiful house in your village of Milano and we're starting now and we hope it's going to be ready before the winter a very nice plaque for you because this is a holy village we cannot touch it sure we can also not touch the house so we're going to put it down here and we hope it will bring you a lot of prosperity and a lot of good luck for the rest of your life and here are the plates your house we donated this house tomorrow we lost both his parents he's an orphan when he was four and seven years old first his father and then his mother now it's 18 it has nothing description is shed it only has a few sheep one pot filled so we decided to give him a nice house to give you a little bit more luck than had in the past we did a lot of work for the green house foundation in the past most of the work is helping people with good seats and in other ways we have never give any attention to the public about our foundation because it is questionable for some people but now when the situation is changing in the world with the cannabis cannabis is getting more accepted cannabis is getting more legal around in the world people are realizing that cannabis is not that bad at all in the end and also us becoming more and more popular YouTube with like 120 million hits we decided that if we go open with the green house foundation maybe we can get more funds and do more things in the future after a good night of rest in the guest house in Milano we started a really long walk really steep walk and we reached one of the most secluded valleys in the area the locals call it Rolly touch it's the valley of the Devils we were a little bit shaky on that walk because we heard rumors the night before that over 200 police officers were on the way to our area to cut down cannabis plants and to perform their circle duties this is a whole game between the politicians the farmers and the police it's a very sad situation the war on drugs takes on and very interesting dimensions when you come to India you've got hundreds of policemen that are paid to to climb up the mountain and try and just cut and the time it takes them to cut one plant is the time it takes someone to rob a plant so this is futile expenditure of energy and it just must be really demoralizing for them it's also quite fantastic for me that in the mountains protect the people the way they do the mountains yeah just make it impossible [Music] Wow look at branch here Ohio wreath we are 3028 meters so what I'm six 700 meters up today yeah 600 meters up we started yeah this is a very touchy the value of the Devils well now today we have to see what we do in the end of the day because there's 200 police down there yeah so if we come back all luggage safe if we have to do an emergency evacuation we go down right to the pass because they're gonna search up to the glacier maybe we don't know yes we will just ask the moon amazing value yeah well basically what we what we figured out up to now is that this side is the warmest ideas and so it matures a little bit keep a lot of Sun and the advantage here much more production much more they can work twelve hours in the other side where we we made the hand we it was only seven hours in here's 12 12 hours son you're really freedom fighters yeah yeah the police comes cut the filth they go more far away have the police ever cut on this side huh have yes they cows on this idea because they know a European community is giving them ten million euros to cut down the plants so what they did basically they're separating the money behaving a little bit here a little bit there and the farmers use went up a little higher and put more fields yeah and also the funny part is that the cops they send up here to cut the plants they themselves smoke charas they rob it's in their culture their families do it in the more in the day time they come they cut the plants in the evening time they as to the local some showers to smoke yeah they know this butcher for them and then they get drunk you know and then she also here the alcohol and more they premised it to the locals to grow chick beans to have a good price instead of growing charles how much do they offer them they offer them eighty rupees per kilo in 1888 zero and emotion and how much do they get and they get six you see six also the government promised so you change it now they are coming to cut the plants more and for these people nothing what they will eat in this winter beautiful answer Franco yes very nice fall over rising you ever here to have the sunlight nearly the whole day yes and now they have an idea rising it's hot the Sun yeah one of the best best creams of the area comes yeah man it's really jungly start the channel miss master they arrived they wrap the seeds fall down with the seeds fall down with ground yeah you see the different phenotypes you don't know that's why you never never get the same cream or charge in this whole area in India in the whole nation and you can see also on the plants that they are really resistant because I mean for the kind of roughness they go through climate wise and altitude wise a pretty healthy and pretty cleaner but you see now it's now's the perfect time to for the harvester we see the plants of turning yellow and of the season of autumn the crystals are SS decisis the other side of the mountains yeah much more a little bit different again and in Malawi style the African style where to put the whole pile there Peter throw the hand you see they see them lying everywhere and an Africa to put little piles everywhere because the birds eat them what smells you get you get sweet you get the sweet you get the minty you get menu I got too many I can make a bowl now on the finish [Music] so here's the end result a very nice piece of of Johnny cream look at this [Music] Branko you as a boom on you should light it up normally Renault mom very nice they're in a very sweet man with a label so this is Rolly touch Shira really touched can he can can a friend explain a little bit the story about this level's valley this place here here was the place of devil his name was Bradley then touch means field yeah and it was eating a man taking his clothes and going in the house of this man where his brother was living with the same face of the man heated but here the Devils they can have the face the same face of the man but they have a heel heel here in the bottom of the feet okay so here versa brother will recognize it he is a devil then when he recognized this he gave to the devil a lot of food so that they will was sleeping in the nighttime he was putting this scissor they used to cut wool to the ships they are big huh in the fire there was a very hot then in the night and well the devil was sleeping he put in the eyes of the devil and the devil died so since the time here people can stay and this is the place maintains the name the name of [Music] I've been before in this area and I know there's very very nice field but we have to pass them and a lot of security things but luckily one of our guides had some connections to a high-ranking police officer there's a very big project going on building dams and the aspects of the environment are totally thrown off work even though they're doing something good to the eyes of the world because they are creating so-called green energy the way they are doing it is just nasty they are they're overruling any logic any environmental rule they are putting lives of people at risk and the condition of living of the workers there are inhuman in saying that not even animals live like that [Music] [Music] when you look at these projects you can see there are economic [Music] [Music] [Music] and that I should get money this company like my friend was peeking we are owners of our life and when they're odd and then we'll come we were left to work and to live for somebody other and that's true it's nice to meet you what's your name what I've heard and this is the good thing in the end is that European community is putting 10 million euros one way in the other by supporting the narcotic police here in India to cut down all those plants and basically what I think is happening now is that this money is divided between politicians police and farmers because what you see happening now is the farmers are pulling a little bit away from the road so it's not in your face totally anymore but they're putting it up more in the mountains and appointing three times more up until a few years ago there were actually shops where you can where you could buy this stuff legal all around India so you know it's it's very difficult to change the attitude of someone when for thousands of years has been part of your culture many plants they just put their foolish come to cut down to plants many ways if you and the funny part is when you talk to a police officer about this you also can say in Europe they will say yeah I know we know that cannabis plants are good but we are just doing our job we have to cut them down and we know that alcohol is much worse well here we have a situation where you interrogate a police officer the highest-ranking police officer of the area and he just basically says Blaine in your face no no alcohol is much better for you and we should not smoke the sheriff so that we tell our children drinking they are smoking better that's also some alcohol many people die just just ready ready said that you have everyone jumping on the alcohol thing and yet Charis is a much more gentler culture you know it makes people shanties makes people think in thousands of years in billions of markers nobody never one died and now they are going to not only the police in the books [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] wow man look at this look at the stocks here incredible Wow amazing this man really incredible Smith who are you pleased to meet you I'm Franco oops sorry Franco come here I'm coming Wow look at this a mind-blowing place look at here everywhere really beautiful stocks are impressive you have all males here full of Mauser I think they leave the male's in some area so that they can make enough seeds for the next year but for sure here they pull them because you can find them on the ground already a lot got enough yeah that's the one water lady Wow look at this a what a lady amazing I'm gonna strange really amazing hardly any strategy but yeah but it has a fruitiness that the others don't have though the others were really mint in US and this one as a fruitiness and it's beautiful you see that the better in the way don't know it already from stock instead of a single pretty flower she's shooting bad stock machines we have we have some seeds we have 15 to take this plane with us across the river with [Music] [Music] the next day we were planning to reach dodge so we got on our bikes where every person that travels through India should do or did its travel around on the big royal enfield the bullet the first time I was in India was 89 I bought the secondhand model in Bombay then I traveled with that 12,000 kilometers all around Libya the Royal Enfield is just an absolute classic and as recurrences we got to Indian we saw how many they were our tongues are just hanging out so we made a plan and arranged - Hassan and your beautiful beautiful experience [Applause] it's actually a nice morning but pretty soon we see thick nasty clouds approaching the sky and in a matter of few hours it starts raining the one where you are unfortunately or not fortunately we walked in the mountains for five six hours in very bad conditions a lot of heavy rain and we find this field Jesus Christ look here guys it's traction incredible the police leader very sheer what happens with European community money but they leave a whole whole part area yeah because you think I would deal with the farmers or something maybe what's coming too late because you see it's usually maybe start raining and they run all the way around away the surprise was not a good one because as we get there we realize that most of the field we were supposed to visit was already being chopped down by the cops and the funny thing again is here that there's so many police officers but the field was so big the only could call half of it but at least you see the destroying of the plant happening right in front of you we just arrived in that field and all the plants were cut down and so much left and then the same time you realized that this is the food for the farmer for a whole year and now he's gonna suffer I'm scared to walk on all this but somehow porter of the field was still standing and what was still standing was pretty damn amazing this pineapple mango this is the pineapple mango story food just a little bit more and we are into the snow mountains we're lucky the rain stops a little bit a little bit but the plants are so wet they cannot make it no we can't we can't drop any charge today because of the rain look at this I will cut it then bring down Wow what's that looks like maybe that is that you're paralyzed man I'm a it looks like every time yeah hi sir don't like just by its female yeah we had to make a small fire in the way on the way down to try to dry our clothes and dry ourselves and fit and that's something that that that just happens you know and when you are strain hunting you have to keep flexible no problem it's part of the game it's actually a lot of fun if you feel the right spirit for it [Music] everybody thinks only in Holland we have coffee shops but I just came back from California there are 4,000 coffee shops there are coffee shops in Spain or coffee shops all over the world but they don't have a license where they are there and the police tolerate these coffee shops and also here in in India I think there's a few hundred coffee shops Tosh is a very colorful little village all the way up into Parvati Valley and we had a contact there in a really nice guest house three male adult guest stars and the atmosphere is really like a coffee shop you sit down and they bring you a nice hot cup of tea and you can sample different varieties of Charles of cream they have children's everything is arranged you can buy your your your hash there and you can you can smoke and people from all over India come there and the police the local police come there to smoke with us so yeah I think it's pretty relaxed after all the stories that we heard so in winter city we had the chance to sample the local cuisine it was a quite hectic quite chaotic experience but the food was really tasty we had a really nice lunch in a traditional Indian restaurant with the Tondo there and some dal and some chapatis it was nice nice to see how the locals enjoyed the food [Music] [Music] after that we had a quite a long trip in car all the way climbing is nasty mountain road with a few problems two or three times with the car with to watch out because the conditions of our of our tires were pretty scary but we got to the top of this beautiful mountain where we can't again it was a very nice night we had a beautiful moonlight we made a big fire and it was really a very special experience was from juvie tillich others have over 50 55 years he he robbing and he went for his father in his best days how many grams a day could he robbed four five gram and forth a from one day what time of the year is it good to make the cherish cut him that to cut me it's like in between end of September to middle of end of September to middle of November until the first no come till the first no covering some can you show the hinge look how black incredible well can you can he explain a little bit more about the medicinal aspects of the ganja great and creepy you think it's most of using for stomach pain for stomach pain okay for sleeping so for sleeping and for stomach pain they used it here very long time it has pill to return the didn't bloated and they're using mostly that seeds for that's what he sings it's for oil yeah for oil what is what do they do with the oil or it for cooking for cooking yes huh very good it's very healthy and what is the good way to make to finish the product like this okay so he turns his finger and it must be in the south or in the shadow that guide to Dubai last equal of you guys did you take like a period find it starting from a son you have some time too much Sun here too much hot and it's more melting so yeah but now it's morning it's okay yes no okay [Music] after four or five hours of walk with the wrath of this amazingly big field with our guides and rush it was like young kids in the candy candy shop [Music] in this area actually the cultivation is a little bit more spread out and you can see that the phenotypes are adapted a bit more to the to being lower in altitude so the sativa character manifests itself a little bit more so for me as a sativa concern it was nice to see the sativas growing a little bit lower than the indica plants growing higher the plants have not this really broad leaf like like it comes out at 3,000 meters here we talk about something that stays a little bit more in the original sativa leaf shape and the smells are bit more mint a bit more fresh a bit more pining so this is the tea plant in the big field that we're gonna pick out for the sheets look at the structure and the mango flavor yeah looks a little bit like it alternates to another mango one yeah mmm Wow there were a incredible beautiful fielder how many Hector's is this how many plants you see they put a lot of mail set is his first field way into my high up in the mines where you see the pool lot of mills yeah they definitely got rid of the mess a while ago there already rotting away look at this it attracts associative RC between us yeah even though I have to say there is less difference overall compared to the thousand meters in the yeah really like candy garden this one whoa this is the real sativa rational this Oh bitterish like very green most like the crystals here completely on the leaf [ __ ] like what we do indoor quite open I see from this side on the Sun it's one big shiny thing and even the leaves you know the little bird leaves they're like totally poor covered [Applause] [Music] the idea came up three years ago in our office to do something new we were very big under pressure in Holland of the right extremist Christian parties and we decided on the office we should create more awareness and show more what's what is cannabis about what's the background of cannabis and which cottages you'd use where you come from one little journey has become a multitude of journeys where we following a pond and we're going to regions which are very very remote that have had very very few outsiders and but also the kind of approach which makes it quite different is that we're not coming here to buy anything or to buy Charis or to buy you know which is was what people ordinarily expect often when Outsiders come here and we're coming to these places to learn that's what's behind strain hunter and the green house foundation it's the feeling of of hunting for something unique and bringing it back and preserving it but also the feeling of leaving something good to the people and the cultures and the environments that that donate this beautiful plant to us and I think at one point I hope we will be a part of the legalization process that people can show this movement to other people who are against condition and give them more awareness about the plant and see how important and how valuable this plant could be to society it's just the continuing project is just an ongoing mission strain hunters are people who can't sit quiet for too long you know we get bored easily so we gotta keep moving [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music] you you", "0h1NWjQPzzk": "[Music] welcome to wheat entertainment and we're going to continue on this journey on multi-strain reviews today we're going to talk about a cultivator called exotic genetics uh i bought three strings from them we're gonna start doing some three i have three different strains within a cultivator reviews you know i was try i was i was doing them maybe the minimum was four before but i can see i have so many threes and i think these flowers are in the stores and people don't know so we're gonna move the uh scale down a little bit and so the flower you're looking at right here was actually my favorite and we're gonna try this at the very very end but we're gonna start with our least favorite and move up to our most favorite so if you want to buy exotic genetics you know and also people who if you know one better than these because maybe you've tried these you can post it below the videos i'll try more exotic genetics i mean some of these cultivators i've tried 30 strains four to even 40 strains but exotic genetics only three and today we're going to talk about them so my least favorite and coming in at number three of all the exotic genetic strains that i tried was something called tina and tina has 24 percent thc and it's an indica and i got this at cookies woodland hills and i gave this flower an eight and the baseline is like an 8.5 and i was joking because you know over my lifetime i've had a lot of girlfriends and there was one girl and i'm i just can't remember what she looks like but i remember she was really tan and cute named tina and you know you name things after someone so probably this is named either the growers tina a mother's tina but i bet you it's his hot girlfriend's name tina unless the cultivators tina and tina was just okay for me in this case and i gave it an eight but we're gonna move up to better flower before we do that let me just load my scooper with one more vapor cup a little scoop here and that's three same amount as a bong hit and you know i talk about vapor cup and we're going to stick this down in about a minute and a half it's going to be ready but it's a great invention this thing is in incredible it has two issues excuse me two u.s patents and instead of taking two drawers or bong rips off of that you can take i don't know 20 i take 12 i don't go so far down on the flower i just when the flower stops i'm out but people go farther and that little bit of flour can stone you to the bone and save you a bunch of weed your throat doesn't hurt your hands don't stink it's incredible device but let's get back to the video coming in at number two we have something called milk and cookies and i got this at cookies maywood i went down for the apples and bananas drop and this is what the bud teddy recommended this was a bud dagger pick and it's a hybrid i gave it an 825 and this flower wasn't really that good for me you know it's as i do these reviews this flower just didn't give me the right feeling and someone made a comment and i think it's it's it's it's absolutely can be true weed can be environmental you can have maybe a lesser weed and go to a rock concert an environment so good you're having a great time right or you could be in a bad mood and some weed might not make you happy right but i'm telling you the ones that i pick to get the high ratings you could be depressed and you're gonna forget about whatever happened and just smile and we're looking for that flower and this flower didn't have it for me so milk and cookies at number two got an eight two five but we're moving up to number one and coming at number one is a strain called luxury you can see i got these all over the place this strain has 22 thc it's hybrid and i got this in my new favorite store the lemonade arlita even though i'm really running by strain whoever has the best strange that's my favorite store but if no one has strains i'm going there why good parking no line better strains because everyone else sells them out revenues lemonade arlita maybe is a little bit of a slower store but i'm sure me talking about it's going to pick it up but this flower is an 865 which means it's stronger than the average flower it's more euphoric than the average flower and it's got focus and i liked it so if you want to try exotic genetics and you don't know which one to pick the one i would grab first is luxurati but there can be better than this i only tried uh three strange so i'm no expert at exotic genetics so if anyone has tips on exotic genetics post it below the video let the people know thanks for joining in we are going to take you out with a vapor cup hit of luxurati i've got this thing set to 330. you can see the vapor in the straw let's check it out i could never get tired of this this star's got a little bit of the og taste but it's smooth i'm telling you i'm old school guy i listen to old school rock and roll i like old school cars but i have moved out of the bong into the new school this thing is incredible and if you want to see vapor cup you can see it at vaporcup.com read the reviews i say it every day because you'll see every day there's more and more reviews because more people buy them and we're all having the same journey together and between all of us oh my god what a journey we've cut out years of smoking we get to compare the best la can give us awesome totally awesome if you want to see my favorite strains they're all on weed entertainment.com i post every day but sunday sunday is my day off thanks for joining in if you like the video please subscribe party on my friends [Music] you", "4XqpFPiegek": "[Music] how's it growing everyone welcome to the second episode of beginner buds the channel for beginners by beginners last week we set up our tent and this week is all about popping beans so strap in and get ready because we're gonna learn all about germinating Otto flowers even better yet we've got something else that's pretty exciting as I'm sure some of you noticed last week beginner buds is a two-person team and you're about to meet the second half oh yeah and we've already made two mistakes and learned a few lessons so let's get into it and have some fun [Music] alright guys so for the first week the only thing we're gonna be giving our plants is water with that in mind we bought a pH meter and calibrated it fortunately for us our meter came with a few packets of powder that would set the pH of a specified amount of water to a precise number allowing the meter to know what it was looking at oh and by the way learn from our mistakes use distilled water when doing this step or you'll likely have inaccurate readings and have to recalibrate it later like we did of course the meter would be invaluable to both us and what we were trying to achieve for those of you who don't know cannabis is roughly 90% water that said water we've supplier plants with is about as important as it comes and if it's off it can significantly hurt the delicate life you're trying to bring into this world in order to prevent this one of the first and most important things you can look at is pH in short pH simply measures the acidity of your water now things are a bit different for soil so if that's what you plan to grow with I wouldn't use these numbers planning to grow using hydroponics we filled two jars with dechlorinated water set the pH to 5.5 and dropped our beans [Music] from there we stuck them into our grow tent with the lights off and let them sit for about 18 hours in darkness [Music] after taking the jars out of the tent we poured our seeds onto a paper towel but then we noticed something rather surprising come to find out the process had already begun our beans were already starting to pop but if you wanna travel then go along yeah what's the fooling us if I never know if you couldn't leave imma let you go as exciting as that was though it was time to wrap them back up and plunge them back into darkness the next step was to wrap them in a wet paper towel now for those of you who don't know you want the towel to be wet but not soaked in a puddle in fact you can roll the edges up like we did and soaked them down with a little more water allowing them to act like a candle lick keeping the entire surface wet for longer in the end you need to make sure they stay wet over the next 36 hours meaning that you'll have to soak them down from time to time with the hard work far from over the next step takes a bit of finesse at this stage the girls are at their most delicate meaning that you'll need to take the utmost care when you handle them when removing the paper towels go slow as we'd learn some of the roots had already started to attach themselves to the fabric of the cloth that said the feeling to see that these seeds were coming to life really was like no other [Music] the crown [Music] that you would stick around just like that it was time to get these ladies into their forever home five-gallon buckets full of cocoa quar before that could happen though we would have to do a little mixing after dumping the cocoa into totes and breaking up the large chunks that had compacted over time and transit eyeballing it we added about 10 or 15 percent perlite and got mixing [Music] with everything set we grabbed our germinated seeds and got ready to transplant now some people say that the seeds should be placed in your medium with the tap roots pointed down at a 45 degree angle but others suggest you just point them straight down that said we went with a ladder I know some people may say that I should've wore gloves here but there was actually a reason that I didn't of course I washed my hands before I started this entire process but in all reality I wanted as much control the situation as possible seeing how these are brand new babies they're extremely delicate and I didn't need a glove getting in my way and having something slip or god forbid break in order to eliminate the minimal risk of touching it with my hand now remember these problems we mentioned earlier one quickly surfaced but took us a few days to figure out although things had started out fine we started to notice quite a bit of positive air pressure in our grow tent we tried a few things including adjusting the settings on our inline fans but as it turns out we just needed to look up at first we thought the pre-filter was losing its color from the UV rays coming off our girl lights but that wasn't it at all come to find out the pre filters were jammed up with so much crap that it was restricting the airflow leaving our tent as a result air was being pushed in easier than it was being forced out to this day I'm not exactly sure if it was white dust from the perlite being blown around or the calcium in the water being vaporized into the tent long story short keep an eye on these for when they need to be cleaned all we did was run it through the washer on delicate and this was all that was needed to allow the fans to function like normal again one thing I just want to say here is that the cannabis community is one worth sharing even better yet connecting with other people over it can make it even more enjoyable that said I've happened to do just that at home so without further ado here she is ladies and gentlemen the other half of beginner buds with the tenth running these ladies breach the surface and took off running [Music] [Music] well almost all of them for some reason we ran into some trouble with one of our ladies knowing that they all germinated and seeing that one of the girls didn't come up for air we started to get concerned after carefully pushing away the cocoa we found what appeared to be a sick plant under the surface fortunately we got to it on time was able to reposition it so that was Leafs were exposed to the light and after a few days began to show signs of progress although the seed kicked out one of the biggest tap roots in the bunch I just couldn't let her take up so much room in the tent and opted to swap her out with a larger plant that I was growing in a smaller Cup seeing how I was able to get a hundred percent germination I didn't want to waste what I had and good thing I didn't sadly our biggest mistake was yet to come as a test let me ask do you see anything wrong with this picture unfortunately we didn't either that is until one of the ladies did this frantically searching for answers we hit the internet before learning that this is what they call stretching in essence this happens when your plants are starving for sunlight with a built-in self-defense mechanism cannabis seedlings will stretch themselves as tall as they can to get above nearby ground cover however they have no need to fight like this and it was entirely our fault and that's when it clicked we forgot to lower our lights seeing how the lights should be around 24 inches from the top of our canopy at this stage in their life we rushed to our tents and put them where they should have been all along quickly we brace the toppled girl and hoped for the best although she looks just fine we may have caused them some unnecessary stress and that's not something we're too happy about fortunately next week is all about nutrients don't forget to Like and

profile on that is amazing and I can't wait to see what this is produced garden the buds has always produced great extractions so I'm super excited wow that looks amazing it has a really really nice dark gold color but it looks like tiny little diamonds ready for me to pluck and to enjoy let's go ahead and put it through the old schnoz test and we'll go from there that is fantastic it definitely is a very unique smell it smells super piney and it also has this really sour stinky overtone I like that a lot very floral and that's why I love live resin that fresh frozen plant really produces an extreme amount of terpenes next we'll get the vape fired up it'll move to the taste test as far as someone who reviews a lot of cannabis i am super impressed by this extraction Cheers it tastes them amazing the Alpha and the beta in there really makes my tongue dance there was a lot of citrus notes coming out of there super lemony but it also had this nice pine and floral finish it was super delicious so delicious now in a third app either they go super low temperature that way I can really extract all those flavors kind of that terpene profile that is phenomenal that's possibly some of the best libraries and I've had in a long time that terpene profile was there it's super heavy I can feel that cheese set it in that indica dominance my favorite it looks it smells and it tastes beautiful let's go ahead and give it a couple minutes see how the effects said it now for the final review of Death Valley cheese live resin brought to you by card in the buds for the visual

pile is the rest of the plant right here I love the bud structure of this plant it looks just like the UK cheese which it that's what the plan is actually is UK cheese course with blueberry it's just like the UK the birds are so frosty I'm not doing trimming them yet I left all the [ __ ] relief on there it definitely has more sugar leaf than the pineapple dispersed at you definitely smells just

"puSwA7s_7FU": "what's going on there stoners here he is back again for another strain review and this time we got some chemo some UVC chemo push so I'm gonna roll up a joint well you guys go down and take an up close and personal look at the UVC chemo cush alrighty guys I'll be closely time on this UVC chemo push you can see the bug looks a little bit Fox daily see the tail here a little bit of a tail there and they're a little bit Fox daily you can actually kind of see where other Fox tails have snapped off of it very nice trim job done on this one right here but let's get you a nice good look at the try coms and the hairs going on it sounds very nice looking stuff let's go ahead and crack the bud open so we can truly appreciate what's going on in there see those nice undisturbed trichomes yeah very nice very nice top-shelf nugs here the UVC chemo kush alright now that right there looks like some chronic chronic flower so why you guys were down there getting nice and up close and personal with this chemo I rolled a joint so we're gonna smoke this while I tell you a little bit about this particular cultivar alright Cheers phase all right I keep saying chemo and if you're wondering why I keep saying chemo that's because this strain right here is that's what it's called it's the UBC chemo push we all know what cush is the UBC stands for University of British Columbia the strain was developed here in Canada after University of British Columbia to help patients manage the symptoms and side effects of chemotherapy treatment for the cancer see the ash nice and white ash hold them together beautifully no that's what I like to see on my flowers so yeah I don't know if you guys know but when when going through chemotherapy there's a lot of really nasty side effects and I think the majority of medical cannabis patients started their medical cannabis to help treat these side effects of the chemotherapy anyway so the University of British Columbia got their hands on I think it was some type of Afghani genetics and they developed this UBC chemo Kush it's a really nice smoke I was very very potent yeah man it's kind of a kind of like a woody taste woody earthy sort of taste hmm now some of the side effects they're trying to combat with the UVC chemo pushes like when you're going through chemotherapy you have no appetite like [ __ ] is just disgusting everything you eat you want to throw up and anything that passes your tongue just tastes absolutely disgusting it's a very painful thing to go through I mean this chemotherapy it doesn't just kill cancer cells it kills everything in your whole body so it's a very painful thing people often how you know too much pain to deal with with just your your typical opiates and stuff then on top of that there's a lot of sleepless nights there so this strain was specifically developed to combat that it's supposed to be it's very relaxing it's supposed to be really good with stress and insomnia so it should make you relaxed and sleepy right and it's definitely gonna give you the munchies I think because like I said that's one of the main things both chemo is you have no appetite you can keep any food down so this is definitely a much you we don't think yeah really good for pain really good for stress really good for insomnia really good for appetite stimulation this joints just about pooched I'm just gonna start to feel some mild effects now I think that's a very nice smell Phyllis you be sneaky mo push so he smoked a joint it burns great and in joint I mean the ash is clean it burns evenly it's nice and smooth very nice grow on this UVC chemo Kush but a joint doesn't always do it for me so I'm going to load up a bowl we're in a small town just doing sure that I'm getting the full effects of this bud all right so our a strain review on the UBC chemo push Cheers oh that's nice it's not too heavy at all it's kind of a light smoke a little bit of a bite a little bit of a bite but you know this is a bit of a bite you piece no really getting that thick pungent miss from it Wow mmm and I'm actually starting to feel some good facts right now my eyes actually feel really heavy my eyes you'll really have you but so now we smoked to join we've taken a good up and close look we've talked about the strain a little bit we've hit the bowl and I'm just gonna sit on this bus for a little bit and I'll check back in a few minutes let you guys know how it's going all right guys all right guys we're like an hour and a half into the buzz now and it's starting to wear down a little bit but to be honest that might be a little bit my fault because this UBC chemo coach here is definitely true to the effects that's advertised I mean if you're if you're smoking chemo you're gonna want some of these nearby trust me I mean maybe that's why my buzz is starting to wear down a little bit man I had like a quite a few of these things and I'm definitely feeling relaxed not really super euphoric but definitely relaxed my pain is gone and I'm definitely hungry so yeah UVC chemo cush definitely affects us advertisement the University of British Columbia did their job and they did it well with this chemo coach strain that they've got here I'm definitely gonna give it two thumbs up solid solid not a time man the ship puts you down so I definitely suggest that you ask your local guy your local dispensary or if you're one of those guys that you're absolutely stuck with shitty LP we'd ask him if they got it definitely fix them up for yourself go on into the comments and let me know what you think but other than that this has been my review on the UVC chemo Kush we'll see you later stores", "FsTbGmv_Cmo": "I'm sorry, but I have to go. *sniffles* It's not you, it's me. Oh God, I drooled all over myself. Hello Internet, it is MarissaSmokes and that is the last time I am ever going to say that. New years, new things, right? *laughs* Um, before I get too far into this video let me be super clear up front, this is the last video that I'm going to be posting on this channel, as far as I know, ever. I'm not going to be removing this channel, everything content-wise on this channel is going to stay up. I am going to be starting a new channel called Oregon Stoner. And, the reason that I'm doing this is because I don't feel like I've put out my best work on this channel, and that's not to say that I'm not proud of what I've done-- what I've done on this channel. Because at the start I was so uncomfortable filming myself, being on camera, being on the Internet, feeling like I had something to say and to contribute, even though I knew that this was something that I wanted to be doing so bad, and had wanted to be doing this for years. So, I'm super proud that I got up the umph and the courage to actually start a channel, to find the niche that I wanted to be in, to try and stick with it. I don't blame it, really, on myself. To an extent I feel like I was a little lazy in my filming and my editing. But I also went through a lot of technological troubles over the past two years, I really haven't had any extra money to spend when any of those things have come up, or even just for things for the channel in general, video ideas that I'd like to create. And then on top of that my mental health has just been in a place where I haven't really been able to put my full effort into what I've been creating, and that goes for all aspects of my life, not just the YouTube channel. But when I look back at all of the videos that I've created here on MarissaSmokes, I can see that in myself, and it might not be entirely obvious to everybody. I know in some of my videos it definitely is because I made a point of being up front and honest about my mental health problems, and trying to be real, which I'm going to continue to do on my new channel, Oregon Stoner. But, I'm just going to be trying to put more into the videos in terms of filming, in terms of editing, in terms of ideas. I'm just going to be giving it my 110%, whereas I feel like this channel I've been giving it, like, my 85%. So, that's what's happening. If you're watching this video right now that means that Oregon Stoner is live right now as well. The last video on this channel and my first vid-- first video, sorry, on the, uh, Oregon Stoner channel are going to be going up at exactly the same time. So, if you've been a subscriber and a supporter here on this channel, I want to say thank you and that I appreciate you, and every comment and like and that you hit subscribe to begin with. I would love to invite you to come subscribe to my new channel, Oregon Stoner where I'm going to be doing more of the same, um, but better, and I'm also going to be expanding my channel more and I really hope to see you all, and hopefully some new faces, there as well. So, I think I'm going to keep this video pretty short and sweet, since I have a lot to get done today and it's already evening time, so, we are going to take a dab of some Vibrant Highs Blue Cheese. This is an indica strain. Vibrant Highs is from the dispensary EugeneOG, my favorite dispensary. And this is their sister company. I don't know if I said that. Did I say that? What am I saying right now? My brain's going a million miles a minute... For the last time friends, let's heat up this nail and take us a dab. My first video over on the Oregon Stoner page will just be a introductory, hello video, but to give you a little sneak peek of what I've got coming up, my second video on that channel is going to be a review of a $12 nectar collector that I bought on Amazon.com and if you want to know if it sucked or if it rocked or what I think of it, you're going to have to go subscribe to the Oregon Stoner channel and stay tuned for my next video to find out. Alright friends, cheers! *coughs* *coughs harder* Peace out friends! I hope to see you on my other channel. There is no next time. Bye! Or, at least not for this channel. That sounded so ominous!", "oxkvfPrJiuY": "here we go some of my UK cheese from Titan seeds really nice looking plants good quality seeds good genetics coming along real nice here I've got a trim them

to the ice boat channel i'm tyler green and this is another cannabis inspired video today we are back with a series by popular demand it is our strain review series and i have with me some sour banana sherbet so this strain was bred by Crockett family farms out in the u.s. it was grown by Kent Valley Farms in the UK and I also got to try some of the extract of this exact batch for the dead Fox Cup 2019 in both hash rose in and flower rose in formed so I'm really excited to try the sour banana sherbert flower today right here on the I smoke channel this is the part where I make this all interactive or I've got a glowing the dog I smoke badge pin here that I'm gonna give away to one of you lucky viewers all you need to do is stay tuned for the question at the end of the video leave your answer in the comments and you will be in with a chance of winning this glow-in-the-dark I smoked in batch sour banana sherbert is a hybrid strain it contains between 18 and 24 percent THC users report that it gives them an uplift makes them happy energized focused it can deal with stress it can deal with anxiety it is that sort of a strain apparently it's an easy grower as well but it does stretch in terms of the height of the plant so do factor that in if you are growing this strain in the legal area so let's talk about the appearance and the sour banana the first thing to mention about this appearance is that this branding is top-notch I'm really impressed with this I like the packaging a lot I like the colors I like the logo design it's a really good bit of packaging the most of the weight that I've picked up does not coming in resemblances this actually reminds me of some of the packaging that you would see out in the u.s. particularly what I have seen on people's into the grand feast when they go out and visit dispensaries and things like that going into the packaging and let's have a look at the buds it's got a little bit of leaf so it died about the bud light coloration the pistols are quite long in apparent but they are actually also a faded sort of dull color they're not changing the color of the buds like I just sort of sitting there but very visible and it looks like it's got a good structure this one potentially looks like they've got a little bit squashed at some point since I've got it but again it's got that same that same sort of a slightly leafy look perhaps not getting top marks in terms of the appearance based on the amount the leaf is left on this but how dense is it's you can still see through it so these combat sort of dried flowers live to it not the best looking but I've seen seeing other bud with a lot more bagged appeal than this but bag appeal is not everything and it is also strain dependent sometimes there's other strains that I've smoked that I love and to look at them you wouldn't think that they were gonna be all that but when you actually smoke them they turn out to be a lot better so that's my thoughts on the appearance let's talk about the smell and the sour banana sugar now this smell is something that I'm very familiar with i was babban the hash was in and the flower rose in throughout the dead fox cup judging process he's got that sour and it's got like a diesel e sort of under time to it as well there are elements of fruit and sweetness hence the name just got quite a unique smell when i found the two extracts that were salvan on the server i could tell that they were the same they were from the same strain put them to one side and that was very apparent this flower is capturing that same sort of smell I'm gonna break some of it open and we're gonna see if any other flavor notes are released from this bit of bud are you ready guys here we go oh wow so I'm getting this real sweet heavy pungent sort of flavors like it's the diesel side of it is heavy and it is in my face after break from that but in half I really like that so the sour fruit notes are quite apparent as I've broken this open sweet banana read to an extent but more just generalized sweet and sour fruity diesel is history around I'm getting off the break and open this but let's go and some of it up [Music] oh the sour fruit is really coming fruit now sour fruit these will in your face very strong it needed a little bit of grinding just to really get that full smell out of that bug which has been sitting there for a little while but now I can really really smell that and I am looking forward to the next part of the review let's talk about the taste the salad and all the sugar so I've got the wheat start wasabi like bomb here with me pick up Ali Bongo thanks for that and we are about to consume some of this delicious Sal banana sherbert delicious smelling the hope it tastes as good as it smells it's been about six days since I've smoked a bomb so this is probably gonna really do the trick and if you are joining me for this one you know what to do get those joints rolled bongs ready that rigs heated up hit that pause button if you need to and we are about to go live and consume this now I've been on a sherbet see you on the other side Cheers [Music] [Music] okay so flavor-wise diesel is probably the most primitive I've got that but I also got a little bit of heat just as much my own fault for not doing the bong as much in the meantime three getting used to that the lung smoke hit a flavor wise this strain really comes into its own with the aftertaste it leaves a banana fruity sour taste on your tongue that is very unique that is very much this strains characteristic its trademark if you will it is a real pleasure in the aftertaste now more so than the actual flavor of that bomb I got their diesel notes when I was hitting it the acridity was very very slight there wasn't much there at all perhaps a little on the drive size just due to the due to the duration that it's been there in the heat that we've had recently that means that the sample probably hasn't been adequately stored that doesn't take away from the beauty of this flavor particularly in the other side this is what I was getting when I was dabbing it in the dead fox cup this taste was what made me scoring so highly it's a very good flavor and one which I could get used to smoking during the daytime let's talk about the effects of the sour core knowledge over have to jump into this section guys because it is hitting me thick and fast as I mentioned I've been a little bit of a tolerance break and so I'm feeling the full effects of the sour banana server it's the hybrid strain I'm feeling good in both my body and my mind I'm not feeling slowed down at all in fact I can probably feel a little bit of speeding up so creativity little bit of energy as well as stress relief is uplifting what my body feels good is sort of spreading out from my my sort of chest really I'm just feeling really nice physically as well and I think that that makes it a very good strain sour banana sherbet from crappie family farms is a sativa and indica hybrid cannabis strains arrived from a J's cup of sour D pollinated with banana sherbert so that's the lineage sour deep crust we've been on the show but affects boys it is strong that one bong is is certainly doing the trick I put this around the 20% THC plus so that fits in with what bread and yeah the hybrid high is lovely and strong very apparent and is making me feel good guys it did say actually they can give you a bit dry mouth alignment the experience in that luckily I haven't forgot my thing today I've been sitting here with this bowl ready to smoke and I'm already feeling quite high after the first Bowl but we always smoke a couple to get a good idea of the strain so we're gonna smoke this one and then something's up join me for this one see you on the other side [Music] [Music] so overall guys in terms of the appearance it wasn't my favorite looking bud I don't think the bag appeal is all that great for the packaging and the branding was very very good he didn't look bad it just a little bit leafy and it wasn't a great looking but but it had been flattened smell wise it smells lovely very very strong sour fruit and diesel like gassy notes but not like ogee gas is kind of different taste wise that is very nice through the bottom I've tried dabbing it so I know it tastes nice in its extract form I'm assuming it tastes really nice and enjoy it as well effects wise I feel really good guys the indica side of is kicking in more now relaxing me I've still got this creative sort of focus that means that I could government's to work very nice strain so it affects boys very good so overall I like this strain right guys so now is your chance to win this I smoked in batch my question for you today is what would you pick as a strain name if you could have absolutely anything be as creative as you want leave it in the comments I'll bring my favorite and I'll send you one of these pin badges remember to hit that like and subscribe button if you enjoyed this video to help the channel grow I'll be back with another one soon guys as always thanks for watching step your roller coaster going down but I never felt this high biggest right of the century [Music]", "ffI0kgOEl58": "the worst strain name that I've definitely come across in 2018 I will say that maybe this strain is a little bit hashtag too soon hashtag maybe not the right time for this tits I heard of one called like cat piss once that I felt like was not appealing in any way I'm not sure why someone would be interested in smoking that cat piss so good dragon's breath hogs breath here's smell this hogs breath yeah sometimes you just get once it don't make any sense Shrek oh gee it's green I guess Slimer skittles or like Zee skittles I feel like strains like that I don't enjoy primarily because of the way that people pronounce them when they order them is like it feels like it's made for people to mispronounce it a lot of people say skittles like skittles or Zee kettles is a is a pretty frequent one cheese it's a really great strain it's such an awesome body high but it just doesn't sound good like you come in and you're like I want to try something good I want to get really high you want some cheese is it funky it's like yesterday smelly cheese kinda I don't want that you do it's really good the Hindu Kush this is when I first started and I didn't believe it I'm like no that's don't you think that's a little racist all the OGS like I get that you need it for lineage purposes but like it just makes people think there's gonna be a heavy indica when it a lot of times it's not even oh gee cut indica dominance had Durbin poison in it that's not straight in the cutter you know pretty ho they try to make it cute they'll make the Oh inho like a heart I don't ask questions I just sell it I always love selling tits to people at the shop particularly the men who are with their wives I'm like you should try some tits it's the best like I feel like I'm sexually harassing you if I'm selling you this dream not a good look for me well the one I named after me juicy G is kind of crazy that one came from dr. dena said if you were a porn star jeah what would it be I said juicy she goes that's the name of your strange they even have something it was called like purple [ __ ] and then people will come in your eye that purple [ __ ] like what and people buy it like the it sells out Jack Herer only because a lot of like seniors think that they know him personally and want to smoke it just regardless of what it will do to them Green crack is definitely at the top of the list Green crack who wants the smooth Green crack having crack in the name kind of has a really negative Association and we're trying to move away from all of the like other hard drugs and differentiate ourselves as an industry I think the one that's always stuck in my mind throughout time is just Alaskan Thunder [ __ ] just because it's such a ridiculously named strain it's been around for so long there's so many like older folks who smoke weed and they always know that strain it always cracks me up somebody came in the other day and I was like a very unassuming little old lady she was like yeah I heard about it you know back in the day like an Alaskan Thunder [ __ ] like my neck whipped around so hard let's get myself whiplash this little lady sitting there like she looks so cute that's actually something like an older gentleman one time they're like do you guys have a last contender [ __ ] and he said super loud and it was the only guy but under there and it was just girls and the girls just turn around she's like gorilla glue you have a glue company called gorilla glue I think there are some issues with that so now it's known as GG number four I'm trying to explain that to people like yeah but how about some GD number four and they're like why is this one have a number in it well there was copyright infringement cuz it's from a company that sells tape well why did they name it after a tape you know I don't know I don't know how to answer that maybe because you stick to the couch when you smoke it and then I like no I don't want that yeah you can just picture them like on their couch with like a plastic wrapper on it just like duct tape to it it's like I didn't where's my nephew [Music]", "E1jXo4_1YtM": "hello everyone the depths of the ocean are one of the most understudied areas in the world unfortunately even in the 21st century we have not been able to study the seabed in detail it is located by the way thousands of meters below the surface of the water however this is where the most interesting and terrifying creatures on the planet live in today's video we're gonna talk about the most amazing living creatures in the depths of the sea tell us in the comments which of these animals would you like to see live if you have the courage of course let's get it on atola jellyfish this creature has never seen the sun but it glows like a celestial body in the mysterious dark waters of the ocean the unusual atolla jellyfish lives in the so-called bathyal zone that is between one thousand and forty thousand meters under water in this place there is no daylight and the pressure is very high you can find this creature in different oceans all jellyfish in this family are capable of emitting flashes of light but the atolla jellyfish uses it for very original purposes the jellyfish begins to emit bright impulses when it's attacked by a predator this instantly attracts the predator's enemies other larger fish to the battlefield then the jellyfish takes advantage of the chaos to escape without being noticed interestingly this animal doesn't use its glow for hunting instead it uses its long trailing tentacle as a fishing rod comb jelly at first glance you might think this unusual creature is a disco ball come on you get a disco but this is a comb jelly and even though it looks very much like a jellyfish it's very different for example it has no tentacles so it swallows its prey through its mouth in one piece like a boa constrictor the appetite of this creature is impressive under certain conditions the comb jelly can eat 10 times its own weight in one day most importantly this unusual animal has a semi-transparent barrel-shaped body that glows in the dark like a rainbow but it doesn't use photophores like other deep-sea organisms the thing is that it combs refract light creating a unique optical effect most comb jellies live at depths of 700 to 1000 meters but some species can be found much deeper sea spider if you suffer from arachnophobia you probably know that spiders are afraid of water they usually don't like this liquid however there are spiders that live in the ocean and their land relatives can hardly compete with them since their legs can reach up to 50 centimeters but these animals use their eight limbs not only to move quickly across the seabed in fact it's through the holes in their legs that the sea spiders get oxygen over time these holes become so large that scientists even compare them to holes and swiss cheese sea spiders are a typical example of so-called deep sea gigantism scientists assume that it's caused by the extremely low temperatures in the deep sea down there larger animals have a very slow metabolism this helps them spend less energy and therefore consume minimal amounts of oxygen and food and as you know these resources are very scarce at the bottom of the ocean fangtooth we are certain you would never want to come close to this creature even in your dreams and although its size is not that impressive the fish is still a terrible predator for many deep-sea dwellers for example fangtooths swallow squids and shrimps without even chewing this creature lives at a depth of about 5 000 meters so it's still poorly studied but we do know that it has the longest teeth of all marine animals in proportion to its body the teeth of adult specimens are so long that the fish can't quite close its mouth the fangtooth even has special recesses in its head that arise from the fangs no wonder this fish can sometimes eat fish that are larger in size anglerfish anglerfish are definitely the most famous deep sea creatures in the world it is their monstrous jaws that we imagine when we hear about the terrible mysteries of the ocean surprisingly in these spooky pictures we usually see female anglerfish because males are much smaller and lead a parasitic lifestyle on the body of their partner like many deep sea animals anglers have barely been studied by researchers and there are almost no photographs of this fish in its natural environment and there is good reason for that these creatures live at a depth of 800 meters and more the most recognizable feature of the angler is the special flashlight on its head which the fish uses as a fishing rod with its help it attracts its prey the most amazing thing is that this part of the body is a special gland controlled by the fish how it can be moved by narrowing or expanding the blood vessels the hunting goes as follows the angler notices its victim and turns on its flashlight then the prey rushes towards the light source and immediately falls into the huge mouth full of sharp teeth to date the order of angler fish includes more than 350 species but there are likely many more using advanced technology scientists make more and more surprising discoveries for example in 2014 scientists at the monterey bay aquarium research institute descended to a depth of 600 meters and took the first ever pictures of this creepy fish here you can see the humpback anglerfish which rarely comes close to the water surface an interesting feature of this fish is that it has a very elastic stomach that allows the fish to eat prey much larger in size for example some humpback anglerfish of a little more than 8 centimeters have been found with 12 centimeter eels inside by the way a humpback anglerfish was featured in the popular animated movie finding nemo more exactly when marlin and dory are searching for a diving mask in the dark abyss the light from these terrible fish helps the friends read the address where they are likely to find nemo deep sea dragon fish the next inhabitant of the ocean's depths can compete with the joker for the title of the world's creepiest smile in other news the building industry and landlords today expressed concern this is the deep sea dragon fish despite measuring between 10 and 15 centimeters these are blood thirsty animals the first thing that strikes us is of course the size of their fangs but if you look closely you'll notice they're transparent why some scientists assume that this allows the dragonfish to get close to their prey without being noticed brilliant isn't it this allows them not to frighten the prey at the most crucial moment also the fish attracts its victims in a very clever way the dragon fish has red and blue photophores just below the eye sockets by the way this fish also knows how to glow most likely this function is used only during the mating period now scientists are carefully studying the composition of the teeth of the dragonfish to try to apply this knowledge to the creation of new materials if they manage to repeat the composition of the unusual fangs of the fish which are both transparent and very strong they could revolutionize the world's industry humboldt squid after seeing the next animal your life won't be the same you probably know the cute squids that usually are used in salads and paella this isn't a creature that makes you shiver but there are over 250 species of squid and some of them are truly amazing the humboldt squid is a real nightmare for fishermen who call it the red devil the reason is that these unusual animals can quickly change color when they hunt this creature can reach the weight of an adult person about 50 kilograms and can grow up to almost 2 meters long and they usually live at the bottom of the ocean at a depth of 700 meters however this doesn't stop people in mexico and peru from fishing this squid these creatures are skilled predators and move in large schools at speeds of over 20 kilometers per hour they can often be quite aggressive and sometimes show cannibalistic behavior there have also been reports of giant squid attacking defenseless divers tionius borealis but don't worry not all squids look like alien monsters out of a horror movie take a close look at this lovely creature it looks like a transparent balloon with eyes and a bird's crest the unusual body helps the squid tionias borealis to stay unnoticed in an environment where any shadow or light source can lead to a brutal massacre these creatures spend their first months of life in the upper layers of the ocean and then dive to the bottom of the ocean they hunt effortlessly simply by staying motionless in the water usually smaller fish mistake the squid for a stone come close to take refugee and are caught by the animal's strong tentacles monsters of the reefs by the way not only the seabed is full of strange and frightening creatures some live much closer to the surface and now we'll show you the most interesting of them for example the frog fish of the anglerfish family among the sea creatures of this family this is the only creature that lives on reefs and not in the dark depths of the sea there are more than 150 species of frogfish and all of them have a very unusual appearance which helps them disguise some for example look like a rock infested with algae others are like a big red coral frogfish lead a fairly sedentary lifestyle so to speak that's why disguising is important for survival and hunting perhaps the most interesting feature of these creatures is the lower fins they use to walk on the bottom of the water as if they were four legged mammals we're sure that you've never seen such a strange shark carpet sharks are found in shallow waters and boast excellent stealth skills in just a few seconds they hide among the coral reefs it's not surprising that many carpet sharks attack humans who unknowingly step on their bodies it's very difficult to notice this sea chameleon underwater bobbit worms may seem a little bit unpleasant but harmless however they're not actually you're only seeing a small part of their body the other two or three meters of the body are hidden under the sea mud waiting for the unsuspecting victim once the prey is near the worm it grabs it paralyzes it with a toxin and drags it into its burrow gotcha fortunately there are no such worms outside the water [Music] you", "LuuQl6JCuc8": "hello everyone it's me again mochi 420 and

as the popularity of Deb's continues to grow so the questions about the many forms these concentrates can take all concentrates are made through a process called extraction where marijuana's main ingredients are concentrated into an essential oil the main three solvents used to create Deb's are butane co2 and ISO isopropyl alcohol after extraction the resulting Deb's can look very different today we're taking a closer look at the three main types of concentrates shatter butter and oil oil is a gooey sticky liquid that can be kind of hard to handle while butter has a creamier consistency from being whipped finely shatter is smooth clear and solid all three can be used in vape pens and oil rigs but finding the right concentrate for you is a matter of preference shatter is the purest and most potent form because it involves a second extraction process that removes fats lipids and waxes this can result in over 80 percent THC however it also means that some of those tasty terpenes are removed therapies are responsible for marijuana's unique smell combined with THC terpenes create the flavor of the pot or concentrate your smoking butter retains more terpenes so it tends to be more flavorful but less potent with THC percentages in the 70s oil tends to be the least refined of the three this form also known as honey oil or butane hash oil can retain a full flavor profile however THC levels are generally less consistent unfortunately availability often determines what type of concentrate you smoke but hopefully this little guide helps those lucky enough to have a choice thanks for watching and stay tuned to hi x comm for more Deb related content including how to select a nail and the rig you [Music]", "qRJ-YbhXiQY": "welcome back to another episode of strain focus the series which delves deep into the nuts and bolts of a cannabis strain to uncover its history current trends and what makes it loved by so many this week we are looking at an absolute powerhouse of a cultivar this is marmalade marmalade came into being thanks to jar hoover at lady sativa genetics who bred this strain by crossing his mother plant exodus cheese with the pollen of an orange diesel v3 male this strain is renowned for its flavor as well as its power the cut or clone of marmalade that everybody is talking about is the rainbow candy cup found by uk grower dank growing farms who was at the time part of the dead fox collective however this isn't the only top-notch marmalade clone in existence some of the first orange hybrids created by ladies sativa genetics were sent out to be tested in the states some of these made their way into the hands of a breeder called moxie mike in maine who found a frosty cut of marmalade which did not make its way back to the uk released in the uk in seed form in 2016 the seeds of marmalade are sold through pure sativa but they aren't in stock at time of recording so people wishing to get their hands on this cultivar right now must seek out somebody with a plant willing to share their genetics but back in 2016 at product earth dank growing farms picked up a pack from this pack of marmalade he planted two regular seeds and both turned out female one was quite cheesy and admittedly very nice but the other was the rainbow candy cut so this is the clone that was kept if you've smoked marmalade in the uk and it has blown you away chances are it's this cut that you have been smoking lady sativa genetics even threw his own clone away after meeting dank growing farms which gives you an indication of just how good the rainbow candy cut is marmalade excels in all areas from the grow itself through to the end product which looks great smells strong has a strong and unique terp profile and delivers potent psychotropic effects marmalade's parent strains are also of note and we will cover cheese in more detail in the next episode cheese was gifted to the exodus collective by a grower from cheltenham hills after it was found in a bag of scentsy seeds skunk number one seats but it was so distinct that it became its own strain orange diesel version 3 was bred by lady sativa genetics who took sonic seeds cut of agent orange and crossed it with original diesel before crossing the resulting strain odv2 back with diesel again to create orange diesel version 3 or odv3 marmalade buds grow big and dense on the stalk yet capture an older look similar to that of exodus cheese the colour of this strain is generally a vibrant green and the pistols are a dark bronze shade and there is a lovely frosted coating of trichomes when you look closely the aroma is a pleasant sweet orange which becomes more sickly as you squeeze the buds unleashing a potent jet fuel aroma alongside the orange which has been described by some as baby sick in resemblance the taste of marmalade hits even stronger than the smell as the terp profile carries through into whatever consumption methods you choose be it smoking this strain through a joint bong or vaping it in a vaporizer you are going to know about it marmalade delivers strong sedating effects alongside a buzzing head high that will hit even a seasoned smoker hard regardless of what other strong strains have been consumed that day this is a potent hybrid strain best suited for even in use due to its sedative and generally hard-hitting effects the strength also makes this strain well suited for medical patients who may be treating stress anxiety or even for chronic pain management some strains seem to deliver a high which sits more in the background allowing you to go about your day marmalade however jumps in front of whatever you are doing and lets you know you've smoked it with a veg time of four to six weeks and a flowering time of nine to ten weeks marmalade is a good strain for commercial grows as seed to crop is 13 to 16 weeks in its entirety the vibrant green buds are strikingly resinous something you can instantly feel between your fingers as you break them apart the frosted trichomes covering the marmalade also sparkle in the light giving this bud the majestical appearance it deserves consumers enjoy marmalade and it is certainly growing in popularity in the south of england with growers such as dank growing farms chemdank and frosted dank genetics all regularly growing this straight it has the potential to be the next cheese amnesia lemon or star dog if the rainbow candy cup makes its way into enough hands will this happen only time will tell but unlike some strains this cut is no longer exclusive to a few collectives and plants have even been known to crop up on the market whatever the future has in store for marmalade it certainly packs a punch in 2020 and so we feel it will stand the test of time and remain popular for years to come so if you're watching this in 2120 let us know how marmalade compares to what you're smoking now", "CkBZ9mkiWK0": "[Music] it's amazing that you know some of the terminology that's you can and can't use you can't say that it cures you of a treatment or is it consider like a food supplement you know sometimes I can't it's a thin line we start dealing with it that's more has to do with the condition there's there's been a lot of studies that cannabis oil or the Rick Simpson oil treatment can reverse tumor growth entirely I mean we I mean there's studies that it's put people into remission from cancer mm-hmm there's a condition called myasthenia gravis where your body produces a chemical that essentially attacks the cartilage in your muscles and in your joints it's a very painful THC kills that chemical off just what does that teach what is this oh is that your Hydra Kahneman can happen all yeah that is the psychoactive component in cannabis that's what gives you the high filling or the Spacey filling it's a more intoxicating component mm-hmm compared to the other ones like the CBD CBG CBC cbn these are all considered CBDs or cannabinoids but they all they all have different strengths and weaknesses CBN for example it can be sleeping juicing usually that's gonna be more associated with the indica strains that are gonna make you more tired okay so indica is more of a relaxer so if somebody is sleep-deprived that would be more important yeah but it also depends on why they're sleep-deprived okay if there's a sleep-deprived because of pain and the inflammation then CBN could be a good thing the best ways like for new patients who have no experience with cannabis what we tell them the best I remember sativa versus indica is sunny sativa it's daytime sunny sativa and indica into couch like they quill a night wheel yeah it's a further elaborate like to further elaborate on that like a sativa is more uplifting more cerebral more like you're gonna feel Spacey you know euphoric happy you know the indica is gonna be more of a body thing you may not get the spacing that's the uplifting the I for ik you're gonna get a relaxation effect you're gonna be wanting to go to bed um so you tailored okay that makes you understand it's not just absolutely absolutely here where I'm going with I never thought it was like it's a it's like a prescription yeah like a prescription has to be a prescription right I just don't think about we marijuana loud whatever it's making it and it being you know like to say disease or specific it targets a specific problem basically you know for my for my street cats you know that okay let's talk about the strains mr. BAE sure so I basically just both of you can just chime in when I when I say a strain you can tell us if it's a sativa indica hemp and you know whatever the strain I say okay if a condition what you know what that strain would you know satisfy condition per se sure alright so gorilla glue gorilla glue typically is a hybrid strain by hybrid I mean that they took sativa and they took a indica and they crossed them together they bred those together and and you essentially are trying to get the best of both worlds something that's cerebral and kind of relaxing or some combination of one or one way or the other for gorilla glue this is going to be more of a functional daytime anti-anxiety strain some people report couch lock with it that's insane gorilla glue um you can get stuck to the couch if you if you do a little bit too much of this um but it's also really good for not completely putting you out so with a decent tolerance you can smoke this and remain functional and in and also will have your medication everywhere and because of that proliferates there is some variety in the strange so well thank you know so I mean you can say that for most any strange to be honest um you could take an indica strain and you can force it to go in a certain way to force it to become a sativa in that and that's how people some people get proprietary strains so the gorilla glue is more of a THC strain this is gonna have more of the the psychoactive effects then the CBDs but uh definitely a good one for like I said anxiety and also maybe a good like sit down watch a movie mmm Scott Walker that is some butchered you put you to bed kind of stuff right there nice so um that's an indica yeah we I think the only one the only two strains we don't have in stock are the blue cheese and the kool-aid cush and actually the kool-aid cush I want to say is something we have under the name of sapphire OG true which I mean tastes like I just I just Google popular strains and ran daddy daddy perfect what's that granddaddy purple is a really very sweet indica dominant strain mostly THC again sometimes it has a little bit of CBD in there like 2 or 3 percent so you can kind of feel it well it's not everything but you kind of start to get letters well especially some of your favorites you kind of you know I mean and then in there you well really there's there's a thousands and thousands of different strains but if you were to look at like one stack with it back in the lineage it's usually combination of like 10 to 20 different strains and then you go one back further step back further it's it's a combination of like maybe 8 landraces so like they'll take Nepalese landrace and like Thailand and them across those and that's like OG Kush or whatever and then they'll take that hoji cush and they'll mix it with some Afghani and get something else or Durbin poison and get Girl Scout cookies you know ten years ago you said you don't have go so G blue dream cheese because she's in kool-aid so go so G blue dream what what type of strain is that so that's it cross um when you take ghost OG it's a very high yielding high potency strain so you can take go Xochitl cross with anything and you're gonna you're gonna get a heavy hitter in a lot of it okay that's that's one of the most like if you were say if you type in highest THC strain ghost oh geez probably on that the top that list 9 out of 10 times so blue dream is also one of those very staple names it's a very awesome that's that's the uplifting you know happy hippie kind of Australia yeah the Woodstock that's the blue dream so you take goes to G and you cross it with blue dream and and you're getting a baseball bat mm-hmm so and that one usually comes in a form of since it's two different strains it usually comes in the form of some kind of concentrate mix of the two or a cartridge or something great sativa and the reason I dig it so much is when I first started out with medical cannabis I was very indica heavy I was like no I need the pain I need to sleep give me the indicas and Durban I think I got to try for free at my first dispensary like the head of Graham to give away and I tried it and it blew me away that I could get the same pain effect but none of the drowsy none of the man I'm gonna take a nap like I just had you know a big plate of barbecue or something and I'm sleepy you know none of that crap it just kept me going and this is a South African land race train like Sean mentioned so its purity it's it's its evolution was in the climate of South Africa so it develops these special properties it carries with it some of the taste of the land and you know it's you can taste it you can taste a difference in these difference oh yeah I mean Sean could can definitely you know he could probably pick out a few of these just taste you you you are amazed I mean both of you are amazing and thank you thank you thank you times honey for joining us this is I mean we're only ten in but 11 through a hundred is gonna be hard to top like this one this episode is epic", "rrJeCvyo5OA": "how you doing guys welcome back to another I smoke video with me your host Tyler Greene in the video today I'm gonna take you through another strain review this time featuring another world first this is double funk by karma genetics and we're going to talk about this strain in a bit more detail right now here on the I smoke channel so karma genetics double funk is a strain which has recently been released it is a collaboration with London dank and it crosses sour dough C dough's with head bang up you can expect a strong hybrid high perhaps leaning towards the indica dominant side based of the heritage of this strain inside the genetics of this are things like dicey dough's which is a strong indicator one that sativa sides this was part of a test run we will see more of the double funk in the future I can't find another review of this strain online so I think I might be the first to cover it big up chem dank big up karma genetics let's go into more detail about the double funk starting with the appearance so we've covered the background in a bit of detail let us look at this but the double funk is glistening with trichomes you can really tell that there are a lot of trichomes on this sample when I was taking the photos I did notice as soon as the flash is on it's like sparkling glistening in your face very very nice reminds me of the look of head banger quite a lot the color of it is quite uniform the pistols are quite long and light and orange yellow but not like darkened or dark color a little bit of leaf on the bud but generally happy with the trim job and it is looking very very nice guys to Dickie he's got a little bit of stick to it when you squeeze it together you can feel sort of a stickiness on the compressed reasonably dense is gaps it's not all pushed together you can see there's gaps in the bud there of course that can be down to the genetics of the stripe generally it is looking a very very nice indeed folks old school head banger type look to it but how does it smell first of all smelling the job itself I'm treated to like a sweet almost like cookies type aroma is coming from the jar perhaps less gassy than some of the other headbanger type strains that I think that I've I've smoked it's not particularly gassy version double funk has got like kind of a almost like a foot smell mixed with a cookie smell that's sort of aroma to it now the buds themselves smell sweeter and more pungent as I'm actually putting them up close into my nostrils now they've got quite a stronger voice it's about that cat piss ammonia type type scent that I'm not really used to smelling on particularly this growers but so no it's not I know part of the strain it's kind of less gassy and more pungent sweet and rich sweet sour sour that's what it is is sour we've cracked it guys it has got a sour smell to it I'm thinking what is that pungent sour notes coming off of the double font let's crack this bud open and see how it smells inside you ready folks oh that's a rich so now I'm getting more of the more of the headbanger is coming back now I've broken it open so inside the bud is returning to some levels of that sour gassy pungency pink I'm going all the way back to the skunk number one in the Heritage now bloody hell now is pungent this this is all over the shop there's a lot of different smells going on in the double funk it's quite a complex one guys but it is smelling good generalized cannabis scent not my favorite in comparison to just strike gasps but your holy brows or like your Colorado kemp's but it is smelling pretty bloody nice but how does it taste all right let us get the double funk into the chunks we don't make a bong oh yes I've also got my mighty vaporizer big up namaste unless Turk profile very different if you are joining me for this one we're about to smoke a bowl of the double funk really excited about trying this strength for the very first time this is a world exclusive strain review of carbage nextdouble funk and i'll see you all on the other side cheers folks [Music] [Music] very smooth very clean smoke and experience that no acridity huh not really bite to it I mean I get the expansiveness from those trichomes it's time to hit me in the sinuses a little bit flavor-wise didn't get as much flavor as I was expecting the head banger comes through but it's less like head banger than I than I thought it would be and more its own strength now we're trying it in the mighty cheers folks now the vapor really interesting they've got their sweet and sour going on the pungency is definitely there and there's also like a freshness like the mint falter now it's more on the sour side it is different to a lot of the strains that I smoked it's like sour mixed with gas it's actually got kind of some old-school cushy sort of flavors in it as well as the skunky flavors and it is very very different I don't think this is my favorite flavor when it comes to cannabis strength is very strong but it's like it's a very different flavor to what I'm used to and upon every breath out I'm getting this like sour pungency which is a it's a completely different terpene profile guys must be coming from this sour dosey doe site because I'm very familiar with a headbanger site definitely states that this tastes before I can't pinpoint what strains it has been in so yeah really interesting one strong sour earthy notes pungent rich all coming through through the mighty vaporizer really well grown weed as well it's it's very very smooth can tell it's like clean medicine you know what I mean it's got that sort of feel to it from the mighty through the chomp we don't make up as much as combusting can film it is to know that covers the taste of the double funk let's talk about the effects of this cannabis strain so as I talked to you guys I am starting to feel the indica LED effects washing over me this is a hybrid it's definitely got sativa in there it's got the Sour Diesel in there a couple of strains back and there's some other strains in the genetics that are also leaning towards the sativa side but there are also a lot of indica leanings to this plan he's really really relaxing that's the first thing kicking in relaxing a little bit of light sensitivity it's still able to to think straight you know it's not it's not giving me a rush so much yet but we are in the initial stages let us see how this progresses strength wise I'd say this is pretty strong guys and the reason being is it's not been terribly long since I consumed it and I am already starting to feel it kicking quite fast now this is partially because it's a new strain and therefore I don't have any tolerance to this cific strain in the same way that I would to something that smoked before where I smoked all the time the strength is also there it's it's certainly feeling strong Stein to slur my words a little bit definitely one if you are wanting a chill out or you need to take yourself down a few levels this is the sort of strain which is it's doing the job for that unless something's up so today we've been covering double bunk by karma genetics it tastes completely different to what I was expecting but it is a very very good looking smelling and effecting plant appearance-wise I thought this looked really really good the trichome coverage the coloration looked a bit like a headbanger to me generally looks like a tidy bit but it's grown well smell wise I really like the smell there's a lot of complex notes picking it apart or come up with all sorts when I was sniffing it when I was breaking open the bar sour rich strong in your face pungent like this is a complex smelling bit of Bud flavor-wise tasted very very strong particularly for the mighty not so much for the qiong's Widowmaker I didn't enjoy the flavor as much as some other strains that I've consumed so really interesting definitely prefer the headbangers gas eNOS and this didn't really have that it's got a really really sour it's a very interesting flavor profile I like how different it is to the other stuff that I've tasted but it's not going to go down as something that I want to be smoking all the time let's just try it one more time [Music] wowza how's good get a bit more flavor on the coughs now what do I get then creamy rich like yo key hit from the from the bomb prefer it through the bomb then the vaping I'm glad I went in for another hit because that tasty the nicer when you smoke it you get like hints of sour amidst the pungency when you vape it you get heavy notes of sour nor a lot of pungency or gas and I prefer smoking it and you can see I'm feeling quite Stoke what do you think of the double funk guys does it sound interesting is it something that you want to smoke do leave your thoughts below and remember to like this video and hit that subscribe button to help the

century [Music]", "7e6jKYStboc": "by about twenty nine here with a harvest and curing update and so we have five different varieties well in reality it's four different varieties and I separated the two different blue Frost's the one that was more yellow and purple I separated from the greener blue frost and they're very similar but they are a little bit different with the yellower blue for us being I think a bit more flavorful and a bit more potent so let's go from left to right so on the left side we have the blue cheese now this bud came out fairly fluffy and I really believe it could have went another two weeks which would have been a 13 weeks and I just couldn't wait that long I had to cut these things down so we'll see how it cures right now it's it's a little bitter and taste not very flavorful and it's a strain that I will have no problem eliminating from my genetic pool next we have one of the blue frost and this is the yellow or purple version and it is a very pungent very sweet very flavorful and next we have the granddaddy Harlequin and this has got a very very nice flavor and it's got a kind of a sativa hi it's very energetic very heady but it also has some indica characteristics and right here we have the greener blue frost and she's very sweet very flavorful but as I said before I think the other Fino is a bit more pungent a bit more flavorful in a bit more potent and all the way to the right we have the birthday cake and this has got a very very it's a taste very similar to ol G Kush or Girl Scout cookies although this is tasting a little bit better than things I've tried from dispensaries and so this bud was grown using 2 3 15 le C's by son system and I've gotten a few questions since I've gone to the le sees about yield well this I believe was the best yield I've had so far and we had a total of I believe it was 882 grams which comes out to 1.4 grams per watt for the 630 watts and so that's basically about 31 ounces produced in with five months of excuse me with five weeks of veg and nine weeks flowering time for the birthday cake and the the granddaddy Harlequin and we went about 75 days for the blue cheese in the blue frost so from this blue cheese we got just about six and a half ounces of dis blue cheese combined we had got 9 and 3/4 ounces of the blue frost from two plants we got about 4 and 3/4 ounces of the granddaddy Harlequin and that was off the two plants you know of course this is the other blue frost and we got 10 just about a little bit over 10 and a half ounces of the birthday cake and that was from four plants so we really got close to a pound for life yeah 31 and a half ounces roughly a little bit more than that awful 630 watts so that's what you can expect off of le seas and you got to understand that some of the bud was harvested early and of course things being strained related if I would have grown only birthday cake and only boo frost I probably would have produced about another 20 to 22 ounces just by growing those strains exclusively because of the heavy production of the blue frost each plant you know produced though close to five ounces so if we would have grown for more blue frost as opposed to the blue cheese we could have easily got gotten 20 more ounces of blue frost which would substantially increase the grand per watt but right now 1.40 grass for what I think is pretty good and that's produced of course with living organics no bottled ludes so this was a very very good run probably my most successful run using the le seas I am one of my most successful runs endure in quite some time it rivaled what I was able to produce with DWC with your basic metal halides and 400 watt HP SN and that it actually exceeded my 600 watts also so I'm very very pleased with the le sees I recommend them I recommend the living organics this all these cannabis strains are very flavorful very potent and as I said this blue cheese is the slacker of the bunch but it the pie still did produce very well and as I said before they they look like they could have gone a couple more weeks this bud is very fluffy and it doesn't look fully developed as a bland or smell than the other ones it's kind of a spicy smell it does get you high now so that's it for now and we're going to continue to cure these girls of course they're still very very fresh it has I said before the granddaddy Harlequin and the birthday cake has been curing for a little bit over two weeks and the blue frost and blue cheese have been curing about a week and right now everything's pretty probably pretty tasty I'm very pleased right now we're routing new clones I will be back at you really really soon with more content and we'll give you a summary of everything I've done this grow the new additions to our living organics and what I plan to do in the future will we'll discuss that all in our next video so girls love to everyone out there keep it green and peace this is bio and I'm out",

wait for any of them to bud and then you have a Gillette Oh blue they're pretty much taken over the garden you have another Jew little blue down here which I personally bent down as you guys can see there's the stock I've entered them using a tomato plant her tomato cage yeah it's playing around oh I should maybe chop it to me so how to top let's see like right here yeah I just use my fingers I pop up any possible way I can so it's left and pop better step in here she's the one behind it up and [Music] nice box token top for another couple weeks anyways this they both up on top like crazy yeah oh yeah guys have just a little outdoor garden update and you got other stuff in the garden too tomatoes math other crap man oh yeah that's gonna be all guys make sure you stay tipsy stay prepping and stay doing genetics how ya cheers y'all you you", "UgwaX8-tysQ": "folks and Grammy welcome to my bro Tennant always growing always learning grab the camera get me in here so as you saw with the thumbnail in the title this video I want to discuss with you the differences between a trained cannabis plant and an untrained cannabis plant most of this will be just my opinion to take from it what you want some flowers are doing well marigolds probably not going to grow and I can't remember what bag is called celosia anyways that's not why we're here those out of the way get to the cannabis so over here oh I suppose I should start by telling you these are all Auto flower plants not photo periods these are the two youngest ones they are 29 30 days old Northern Lights on the Left blue dramatic back there so these ones about a week ago actually eight days ago to be exact I put a video on YouTube where I showed the training of these plants so I'll leave a link in the description below to that video if you want you could if you haven't watched it pause this check out that video to see what these plants look like eight days ago and come back join this video again yeah the training went well the plants responded well no issues the blue dramatic really caught me off guard and went into flower like two days after I trained it so I wasn't sure if that was induced by the training or if that was just in the genetics and that's how it was going to go regardless of what I did considering the Northern Lights auto flower received similar training at the exact same time I don't believe it was the training that induced flowering anyways you can see these plants due to the training have a nice level canopy everything's pretty even on top as opposed to these ones so the the one on the right there that is my bloody skunk and it is 48 days old that little girl there is a big bud Otto it is 30 or no sorry 47 days old different size clearly but similar shape so the problem with this in my opinion you can see the very top of the plant it stretches up and up and then the next level of flower off the tertiary branches I think that they're called ways yeah the difference between that and that is 12 inches so the intensity of light from there to there weakens greatly so while the top of the plant is getting lots of light lots of energy and thriving here we are 12 inches lower and and not getting quite as much and then down another four inches or so you get ones like this and like this so they're close to two feet away from the top of the plant so while the top will be getting a certain amount of light the bottom is not getting nearly as intense of light I suspect the flowers will develop and ripen differently I may have to harvest the top of the plant chop it halfway down and then let the lower half go a bit longer I'm not sure yet that's what happens with the untrained plant when you just let it go and do its thing now my buddy jalapeno he's old I mean old school and he's never been one to train his plants he just puts a seed in the dirt and lets the plant grow it knows how to do its thing but yeah the past year I've been watching a lot on YouTube learning a lot and I think training the plant is the way to go especially if you're indoors dealing with limited limited space outdoors is different of course and when dealing with auto flowers I wasn't sure how much LST they could take but yeah there was no issues just bend the main stem over and tie down the other stems or the other branches that come off of it and they had the plant plants are doing quite well yeah I guess that was all I really wanted to cover I wanted to keep this short and not waste too much of your time but just show you the difference between the trained and untrained plants and yeah briefly explain why I like to train mine so I don't think I'll be growing OTO flowers next run I'm pretty sure I'm going back to photoperiod plants once these ones are done and there will be plenty more training with those gonna be topping them and bending them yeah abusing them but anyhow that's in the future for now we'll put an end to this video so you can see this bloody skunk is coming along quite nice phone does not like to focus when I want it to so yeah there'll be more updates on that as those flowers develop get a bit prettier to look at and these two plants down here even though they're two and a half weeks different in age they're both close to the same same size of flowers yeah will be short time after that bloody skunk and then still got the Northern Lights too so yeah lots going on in the tent lots of updates coming so click Subscribe if you haven't already and yeah hit that Bell and you'll be sure to get notified whenever I do release an update yeah I guess we'll just end it there and I'll see you in the next one alright take care", "pn0cuh1l81I": "hey everyone hey everybody boy we we - blade Willie here piece to it - how's everybody Sunday night going just want to show you a quick update on the Hells Angel og Exodus cheese just a couple of other than real quick ones post a quick video I really want to show the oh gee I've only seen one of the person has it and it's breeding with it what they cross but this [ __ ] cheese a little bit now oh sorry sorry hold on I gotta get these things on here we go yeah so I'm gonna see if I can do it without taking a million pictures and get that so alright so 23 days and Exodus cheese looking very nice stacking beautifully all the way down I didn't stretch as much as I thought it was going to but still within half just a beautiful plant you can see the rail study should be you see the Detroit whales died three rails but just looking really nice and I have two of these you have to India all right fraying beautifully lights are about to a while itself some of them do sag but for light so obviously they anticipate it but just looking gorgeous I look at our stretching light that light is going to stack you two all the way up really nice this DX is cheesy that day 23 very much so a lot farther along and then we have you know obviously in the bag they haven't the colors coming in on here huh so they're beautiful yes beautiful this rock dance now she's almost at the end of week nine I know it's you nice look at that Frost I just don't get enough of her and then right beside her - there's the Sawa alien dog just bulking up putting on some just a last look at the colors teal beautiful Dark Tower purple leaves all the way down we gotta pick up a tomato cage sleeve definitely a very skinny lens so very and they're under metal-halide here too by the way if now we've been away a life so let's take a look at the house Angela - that was too bad Superman not bad stacking we definitely have some spacing my first month with her as well just like it's good to you so this is a 4 foot plant without the bucket swing at that Claro after there sorry everybody but those are a couple of the main poles so beautiful develop itself I mean looking gorgeous so far a little bit of tip line I didn't get to him for a day and if people even though they're Phoenix stay pretty stable state long but it was right around five nine five eight sorry Lucy only if it's a little more focus it's a stacking line at all just gorgeous beautiful thing just healthy couldn't ask for anything better right now so yeah you know this busily right there this I wouldn't take my hand off this camera just for a second did it get an idea of how thinking these are if they are gorgeous let me see if I can do it real quick yeah boy just you know someone will always do nice nice leaves this one here has some huge mamas you know but I do a lot of leaf sucking so this beautiful gorgeous weird light penetration we talking we've talking anything we can do to max that yield so and this is the second one they're focusing we know these are food clone West Coast Guard I was told you know very special what I had I guess was very happy to get it I'm very grateful to get anything but some nice Daffy now she's a little bit later she might even stack a little high or two I mean she's just in three flower right now just come about to come out of three flower definitely develop this few days later than the Exodus Jesus you can see but all in all gorgeous developing just praying nicely like I said the lights are about to go out so and I do a lot of leaf tucking so if they're already kind of sagging leaves she and definitely anticipate sleeping and she and I like I said I do what we do so as you can see yeah definitely maximized man like penetration you know because you know on average only getting 12 inches of penetration now I will work there a little better next time as you can see I don't want it to stretch this much and work out a little bit better in veg I have another one down there so that's nice to pull this to the next round to go in so working really really nice so anyway so I started the studies out there getting you know I'm really I'm using the G H I don't use any grow based on the Lupus formula like I'm coolin powder for my finish to my right winter and finisher I use Open Sesame as my starter but kandi and my enzyme I use this as an SOS it's called SOS it's fully organic it's extremely inexpensive and it's what they actually use in the commercial agricultural industry full-field the irrigation greenhouse etc you know that's what I used to work in for a while though I've been a master of I've been a done a lot of things in my life so but yeah but always with agriculture horticulture pretty much my own life-positive build it for a while was a Master Mason but nice snacking on Nexus cheese too huh yeah looking good both of them looking really really nice so have been running around 70 degrees in here which is perfect the night time we're getting down to about 60 so and with the DWC that's what we want when we going to Coco won't be as bad we want to run in that low if I don't want to which will help me save a little money cool it's okay so intensely so but yeah those are the Hells Angels looking really really nice I couldn't ask for a better first run so yeah so they're wondering about 1,400 PPM's now like I said I left them and then just the one to go I was real quick I want to show some over-watering I mean see the chlorine right there can you see that on there yeah you guys see that flowering that's not nice it that's on nitro nitrous in toxicity that is over watering the root balls but too big in the buckets in about 6 gallons or never Rises yet that right there is no little watering now I'm going to give some up on the yield but this might have a tweak you know this is my favorite one out of all that frost on her he's looking really nice boy to stocks I wish I could dismantle head tie to dismantle this and my garden rather and I could really pull the inside a spotlight up look beautiful look at that bro so then we of course we have the monster pushed over there in the back and then we help a buddy feel right there and then we have three more finishing up there and these two finishing up here so valiantly into our loop those purple leaves you catch it on this all right seven minutes long enough so I leave back out so is our Exodus cheese in 23 days and then is that healthy devotees with these two edge of this cheese make them fighters but those out if they're the next ones coming up after these B's finish up these know quite a few weeks but a few more weeks left so I left that

extra seal i really do like that and the kush mountains is coming to you at a 30 on the thc a 0.21 on the cbd for a total cannabinoids of 31 and this is a hybrid take a look at the bud there it looks really good it's really frosty it's got that real strong cush smell to it and like always if you want to see an up close picture of the product check it out as you can see there it looks really good a lot of trichomes it's frosty it wasn't a super dry it's actually very fresh and i did get this at blue fire dispensary in merced california and it is going to run you around 52 for the eighth around

is very sticky it's got that strong cush smell to it and without further ado let's get into it cheers everybody the cush mountains by cbx [Music] so okay first initial thought it has great flavor it tastes really good it's like one of the better cushes that i've ever tasted before it has an excellent flavor the smoothness is there it's not harsh at all it does pack a punch it doesn't have that lung expansion that i'm used to on an indica but this is a hybrid but it does pack a punch it's still hitting me right now as i'm talking to you guys so but like everybody knows two for the review cush mountains by cbx so far i've tried the white walker og now the kush mountains and the strawberry lemonade i gotta say so far i'm really liking the cush mountains and how they got cush mountains it actually is white walker og crossed with blue flame og i've never heard of blue flame og but i have reviewed the white walker and it was really [ __ ] good and everybody please remember to smile [Music] i don't think so grab him and pull him down [Music] i'm telling you man this new job's kicking my ass i'm [ __ ] tired every day when i get off from work it's a lot of manual labor but i'm

review that second one packed a harder uh a way harder punch than the first one that one hit me i really like the smoothness and the flavor of this weed it is strong too it's hitting me where it needs to [ __ ] where i need to be hit i really like the look of the buds it smells great nice dense nugs it wasn't dry and a lot of trichomes so it looks great it smells great it tastes great this is a [ __ ] good strength let me sit here for a second before i calculate it up see who we got today uzi suzy this one's pretty creepy that one's dope some of these are kind of creepy i like them okay let's get the beer board while i calculate this up for you guys the cush mountains by cbx sorry i couldn't use the finger okay the look and the smell is amazing like i said it looks really good it's full of [ __ ] trichomes it's real uh nice dense buds it was fresh it wasn't dry at all the smell was great super cush smell real strong i loved it the the the smoothness is definitely there wasn't harsh at all and the high it packed a [ __ ] a solid punch the first hit i was kind of iffy i was like for the second hit it let me know this [ __ ] is for real so the the cush mountains is a great strain what's my number overall for the kush mountains by cbx i'm gonna give it the 8.6 you know it's a solid strain i can't give it any higher than that because it didn't like blow my [ __ ] doors off or knock my socks off but it did pack the punch that i needed the flavor is definitely there i would definitely buy this strain again it is very expensive so the next one i will try a different strain because i want to review them all but this would be a definite buy again so overall for the cush mountains by cbx i'm giving it the 8.6 that was my review i hope you guys enjoyed it until next time smoking with small town [Music] oh", "9v2fkY5WuXc": "yes sir oh man we got a crazy one and this one is actually the strongest when I had testing out at 36% yes sir do you like purple punch you like dosey doe I got the father I got the mixture of both yes sir yes sir it's called slur Akane berry not hurricane but slower cane baby and this is your boy home smiling a stranded date dirt gang TV let's talk about it let's roll one yes sir dirt gang boy [Applause] there's no more pressure on there in the like if you understand relationship you roll one for mr. Malik you are tuned in Dirk gang TV take a dish enroll it with me - then - Dirk gang TV row on row on row on this is looking crazy my friend very closely my friend what the reason what to do only run

and roll it tight yes sir we have slur akane slower King yes sir and I know you're thinking in your head like what is a slower Kane listen so a lot of y'all out there especially in your purple punch running crazy out there purple punch purple dragon all for the most part is all in the same category and then you got dou Z dou which is like a very strong cookie to total tune in to my last video - we talk a lot about the dough see going into slumber cain is a hybrid it is an indica hybrid mainly based indica hybrid - that's why I test so high at 36% and I said it 36% now y'all out there still tight yeah listen yeah I'm not even getting close to that when I seen this I had to grab it 36 percent hybrid what took him on electric and gas car what think about it electric gas listen it's a hybrid thing today man this is a hybrid thing today yes sir so man a lot of y'all we always get it to an indica trying to sit back chill mellow go to sleep want a good night's rest chilling back YouTube and chill with your girl I'm saying watch some dirt gang TV you know this is the way to go sativa you try to be up you want to do know do some running you know go to gym you know you might go to lose the part you know about me hanging out with a thousand kids you know but you still want to be old but you still got to be there that's the way it goes who goes to teaming in a hybrid for the most part is a mixture of both but in this instance you do have indica dominant hybrids and then you do have sativa dominant hybrids or you may just have a hybrid which is a equal consistency of both but in this instance it's it's a hybrid mixed with an indica so that's why it's an indica base hybrid yes sir it is called the slugger can I just did the last video on dosey doe so you know those who throw is a very high strain of cookies um the purple punch purple punch would be the hybrid of it - - where you add it so you add an indica base which is the which is the dosey doe and then you add in a hybrid part of it which is um which is the purple punch so together combined it makes the indica base hybrid but yeah man you've seen the multi colors on it man the colors is crazy colors on his crazy got a little bit of green you got some purple you got some orange you know I'm pretty sure when i crack it open a little pilot the same way - but yes sir 36 percent or y'all runs out there go find some rust that's 32 code file one only thing I find and testing out higher than this right now it's like moon rocks I'm saying but yeah man so yeah I know as i do as I always do I'm about to go twist up the Dutch master bring it right back into it man and we're gonna get into it man yeah boy all I'm smiling man multiple coherent miss this is looking cry see my friend very curiously my friend so I know a lot of y'all go be look at me I go be looking like well I need you to listen I'm still do the finger test y'all are here rolling up a little kids finger but this one is sparked already know all the reason why I look smart cuz now I gotta tell you how to funny story but I'm not gonna let y'all see the funny story so I had to cut the clip because originally I I lit this up but when I lit it up I hit like a champion who and boy did I go down whoo yo this one is crazy like you taste the you taste it though I mean it hit hard like the dosey doe but you also taste the purple punch was have like that blueberry flavor to it too I mean like it's it's crazy to so when I hit it almost died on cam so I couldn't show you all that cuz I can't have y'all and he called me the baby lungs and all that good though so yeah there we go get back into a bed that was crazy so I had to dump that whole part that the redo it over to so you know I mean it was good I mean I was good I was talking and I was rolling and next thing you know it was a hook and I reached for my juice in yeah I can't have y'all on cams in all that man so let you let's get it to it man so like I said bad it's definitely taste the blueberry in there you don't know the taste is for the perfect punch punch tastes like blueberry and you had like a you know it tastes like Spanish sports she was inside there was Dave - it's crazy but it also hit hard like the black you could hit like I'm I told y'all before in the last video the dosey doe they all like a champion and you know when you combine these two it's you know I'm looking at myself through the camera right now knock already tell the difference already inside my eyes you said I'm saying so you know it yeah yeah yeah so I had to you know I had to come back to it but it's a nice little great taste to it so I'm gonna be a thousand percent honest with y'all man Oh for all you strong for you if you want something super strong and you and Ali who state even if not you go to visit the legal state and you trying to get something super because sometimes when I go to certain places man and it's like you know I go to these different dispensaries you know I'm trying to look for something that's like strong because I pack you know my tolerance up there so I know other people they're looking for specific like fruity tasting you know stuff like that - you know - it has like a nice fruit flavor taste to it a mango blueberry you know a strawberry you know pineapple you know something that it's taste like that but uh in this instance this has both this has both but if you're looking for something like honestly if you want on people that do can't handle Strong's friends this is not the way to go I know certain people they would like to do I like to smoke but I don't like nothing that's the strands that's super strong like that you see it I'm saying you know stuff that's gonna make me coughing you know this is not your round please get on a different Highway this is [ __ ] I don't care if you want something free I don't care if you want something that's just strong that pack a punch you like purple punch you like dosey doe this is the way to go i'ma be honest this plan is this friend is crazy huh see I'm saying I got I can't even do a top 5 of my strands no more now I gotta escalate it to a top 10 strand because it's just certain strands that I've just got to make room for and this is one how do I not make room for this dish strange crazy I'm telling y'all slur Akane you're not gonna forget that name see it I'm saying slur Burke and if you see I'm telling you grab it it's worth it I don't care what it's worth it I'm telling you just to try it out it's worth it it's a mixture member dosey doe purple punch you can bond

you by the time i'm done we'll be on the moon now let's start the show thank you for the view what's up world welcome to sorry about that welcome to juvenile styles today i'm coming at you with alien og check it out so i got this nice joint roll of it we're going to light it up and give this strain and these buds a nice thorough review and of course i got the bomb to try it out and that as well so let's light this up and give it a nice review so it has a very nice taste actually it's like i taste a lot of crystal but i also kind of taste like kind of a seasoning type of taste maybe kind of like peppery a little bit it does have a nice taste and this was 28 percent thc so it's not too bad it's pretty high up there definitely at higher but it is up there with the strains and this is three grams of it minus the joint that i rolled so i think that was a pretty good account for the three grams so let's give it a little sniff test i kind of through the bag i kind of smell a bit of vanilla in it although i do kind of smell the like spice seasoning type of taste or type of smell like i taste in the joint smell very nice though so i'll give you the close-up here now if you've never seen my show now you know we get so high that we fly [Music] but i know it will all [Music] [Music] let's take another look at one of these other buds this is a nice sized one here it's not a bad looking strain as you can see it's kind of frosty nice crystals on it and i've had this strain this bag for about a week or so i think so it's a little dried out but that was my fault i should have took better care of it and stored it a little better but i can't blame that on the strain so i'm not going to leave that in the rating so the texture because i remember when i did get it it wasn't quite as dry so i'll still give the texture a nice writing for a texture of these buds but i'm going to give i'm going to take a bomb head first before we write the flavor because it's not fair so i'm going to throw this down for a second and we'll take a hit from the bomb well i got a little bit in there from the last strings one second let's throw a nice little piece in here at least it's dry like i said so it breaks right apart there we go got a nice little bowl up there let's light it up um that's pretty good oh that gave me a nice hit so i'll say give me a second all right i'll say i'm gonna give the flavor i'll give the flavor a 3.5 to a 4 out of 5. it's pretty good tasted nice nice tasting straight so i'll give you a 3.5 to a 4 out of 5 for the rating for the flavor it's not too bad i'll give the same for the texture of the bun because it's pretty nice buds a little dryer now but it wasn't so bad when i first got it so i count i can't breathe no i'm just joking i can't stop choking now i'm just playing but yeah i'll give the account so it's nice ass three so i'll give it minus to join so i'll give it a nice i'll give it a 4.5 per account because that's a really nice thing and i think this alien ochi deserves an overall four out of five it's really good i definitely recommend it and this one was just three a's so it wasn't four but still a really good joint a really good strain i definitely recommend it if you get a chance to try it out try it out and i'll show you guys the plants that i cut down early what i got out of them you could definitely tell that they're way too early some of them ain't the buds ain't too bad like one of the plants i think was pretty close so it's not too too bad but the rest of them likes it not it's just so i think i'm going to use it to make a little bit of hash or something like that so that's what i'll use that [ __ ] for and i'll show you guys the plants now and i want you to let me know in the comments how long do you think left i don't think there's not much left because the main ones that are closer closest there's a couple that needs a little longer but i think the closest ones are about at least 50 percent brown hair so it said to make sure they're around 75 to 90 percent and the trichromes are bulbed up and everything so um yeah if you have any advice how long you think they're going to take you can let me know i appreciate it and yeah i hope you guys are all having a good night and hope y'all got some good [ __ ] to smoke i'm gonna leave it there you'll have a good one peace hundred thousand views really more to go this the show hundreds of different strains of smoke there's no joke breaking up the big puff and choke if you've never seen my show now you know we get so high that we fly the globe puffing up the clouds and the clouds gone with the wind let's get stoned then there's no dough now i'm broke just for now take a toll this is marijuana hoe but i know it will all pay off because my lines are doping i won't stop until i'm at the top of my mountain and i'm not gonna [ __ ] go hundred thousand views really more to go this the show hundreds of different strains of smoke there's no joke flicking up the pig puff and choke if you've never seen my show now you know we get so high that we fly the glow puffing aloud in a cloud this my own and i pop up like hi i'm home let's get stoned", "X3SlPDOUWeg": "what is up everybody this is star from star Delta 9 coming at you on a hump day with a new piece oh yes I am have a [ __ ] on you I'm gonna sit my fat ass down here you having a fabulous day I hope you're having a fabulous day I'm having a beautiful day it is gorgeous outside just gorgeous I wanted to come at you guys and talk to you guys about the 10 strains that I looked at at putting in my garden as a new grower and I the reason I looked at them is because they were fast producing strains I was impatient so if you're impatient like me and you want to get something going and you want a harvest I'm gonna give you the 10 that I researched and considered putting it in my garden but first I want to pick a rip I am smoking on some having me think oh yes I am a little bit came off of the plant look how Purdy she is just lovely lovely lovely and I have grind some up and put it in my right box and come on take a rip what are you ripping on you know a girl wants to know please leave it down in the comments and as always this channel is for 18 and older cannabis and cannabis enthusiasts and if you are not one would you please get the [ __ ] off my channel subscribe up there comment down here hit that go if you want to know I'm gonna go lie or put up any videos like this because you never know what girl's gonna put up ooh that risk good I bought silicone cuz I didn't want to break it so I'm gonna get on with this before I run out of time how that picanha please tell me how you are happy Thanksgiving to you all hope you have a blessed blessed holiday here are the 10 strings that I considered putting in my garden number one is called low rider low rider is a hybrid string that was an inbred and about nine generations by joint dr. seeds I believe it gets about 16 inches tall they call it the window seal string because it's discreet and it's small but it is like dwarf size but it is stout it's a cross between Northern Lights and William wanders and it was crossed with the routiers plant which we all know the routiers plant has very low THC so 40 to 45 days that would cycles number who critical caused by barney farms that one will cycle in 50 to 60 days it took on mostly and indicas side it's kind of a it's it's a hybrid string but like I said and pics are more of the indica side because it was a cross between critical cush mass and OG Kush has a high THC a moderate CBD profile to it and it's a high prime strain number three is early girl you know early girl the wallflower of cannabis that's what they call it it's been around since 1980s it was first bred by census seeds I believe it's really compact resilient novice growers love it because it's resilient and compact and short numbers pawa OG Kush the origin of OG Kush genetics remains a mystery it remains a mystery the myth is it's Kim Dogg and Hindu Kush no it was first bred by Imperial genetics I believe and it hasn't there's many many many many different phenotypes out there right now some of the examples of the phenotypes would be the Tahoe og it's still a hybrid strain it's a heavy hitter it's a couch locker and it's short and stout in and has seven to eight week cycle now number five remember this one super glue super glue [ __ ] I have to keep super glue in my house so I don't break my nails that's a hybrid that is by cedar cedar cedar see the seats I don't know how to say that name yes the Seb is M I believe seeds it's an Afghani cross with Northern Lights it's a indica dominant strain about seven to 12 weeks number six are you ready Red Dwarf this is one I seriously seriously considered putting in my garden now the reason I did is because it's short and squatty and it harvests in seven to twelve weeks it's easy to grow so novice growers can put it in cabinets or small places and it's a favorite among growers it has very good traits to it the plant is known for really calm but but this plant does also come from the routiers plant but it's been cross bred and back bred and back bread so it's a it's a different phenotype from the original so number seven I love number Seven's named Hobbit you guys I'm sure you've heard of Hobbit Hobbit had a nickname of strawberry can't be right because the poet was like eating strawberry candy if you've not smoked any Hobbit you need to get you some Hobbit because it tastes just like strawberry candy to me it will cycle in 65 days it was originally bred by canna Biss seeds with a k and it's an autumn flower and it has above average yield for 65 days now no egg ready right I know let's take another rip white rhino that's also a Rudy Ellis version of the white rhino and the low rider or yeah the low rider that's an auto flower but it is a potentially high high indica strain and I believe that was from riot seeds Cheers do I like this number nine you ready number nine is purple cheese now purple cheese is an interesting string it is an indica dominant hybrid yeah I see it it's purple one blue cheese and lowrider the first one I mentioned the reason I looked at this one is because there has such tight tight bed structure I mean this [ __ ] stacks like a mofo she's short squatty high CBD profile and has a very very fruitful matter to her to our palate so another thing I liked about it because sometimes it gets really chilly up here in the fall and this plant thrives in colder climates in fact they say that the purple hues in the purr and the purple cheese comes out better even when she's in the 8th and 9th and 10th week of flowering now she's they didn't when I looked it up I couldn't find an actual week time or day time what they would tell me was like 50 to 80 centimeters so I'm assuming you're just gonna have to watch your trichomes and not let it get any higher than that so number 10 now these are in no particular order you're not by which ones are my favorite by any means okay so number 10 I'm trying to straighten myself but dad would always say sit up straight Billy and put you had it right yo haze I always have trouble with this seed breeder for some reason it's Dyna Phil I believe seeds and it's a sativa strain it's the only sativa I looked at because it's a cross between skunk haze and Northern Lights and outdoor growers appreciated it because of its resilience and its flexibility and so I mean even in even in colder temperatures at week 10 and 11 this one flowered beautifully and laid on some beautiful colors and trichomes this one takes a bit of patience and it's probably the longest strain that I mentioned out of the pen it's an auto flower it's kind of a rendition of royal haze and it was bred by royal Queen seeds I believe don't quote me and they mixed it with amnesia and a skunk Rudy Alice and people [ __ ] love it Cheers so those are my 10 that I looked at what are some of the 10 you looked at for your garden as a first-time grower I really would like to know because uh when I first started growing I knew I knew I had to grow for my environment and my environment is a 4 by 4 by 7 so I couldn't get a long sativa I had to get a short stout squatty indica that's why I loved some of the ones I told you about the Wallflower you know and the window seal because you can grow them in stealth mode nobody knows and that's exactly what they've been bred for is that kind of space so grow according to your environment if you can I know when I first started growing I was really impatient I even dropped a bag seeds I even dropped bad seats that I had gotten from like I don't know maybe buys or maybe somebody gave me a bud or something and I found a seed and my planning it Cheers but I think it's important to grow according to your environment and you know if you have a very small space look at some of the indica strains that don't grow very big like some of the ones I mentioned 16 inches that's not very big it's not very big it's not very tall so you could grow your own medication and I wanted to grow indica strains and so that's another reason why I picked short and stout and because that's indica now it doesn't mean I dislike sativa Silas Tevas so I'm going to take another trip with you please tell me below what strains did you consider growing in your garden when you first started growing which ones did you look at I'm gonna put a little bit of juice on top of here I'm gonna show you the key from me heavenly dank and this is the first time I've scooped up any key from her on this video ooh-wee are you kidding me look at that lovely so I'm gonna stuff a little of this on top and I'm gonna take another rip with you and I'm gonna get my booty out of here baa hooting Cheers oh that's gonna drag whoo-hoo one plant one live one tree there's are my pens what are yours you know a girl wants to know Happy Thanksgiving", "WqTaJQ_AVyc": "[Music] Friday everybody welcome back to the channel we are checking in on the bench tent and as you can see well I pulled mother still help her down put the other four ball but so now we're running all of the light in the tent and it does have a little note to not run more than you know nine point three was a ten point three six yeah nine point three six amps through these which this small ones one point eight and I don't remember this was like three stickers on the outside that matter it's fine snap popping a fuse or breaker I mean we run in that light and everything else so we're good no worries I am kind of at the limit of one 15 amp circuit though but I got more got more plans for that later huh but I moved some stuff around in the veg tent I pulled the last couple of seeds that didn't go squeeze in here and see everything that we got going on they're all looking pretty nice now though no complaints we got one little one that might not end up going we'll let that one kind of go and see then we got the one that still got a shell on them back there but it's going it's trying and got the two-for-one special which this is a first for me so it's kind of cool we'll see how that goes yeah pretty good nothing special to report I mean move these around so that most of the bigger plants were under the bigger light you do need to keep this one a little bit higher you know told you guys a couple times you know I've got the H Oh I don't know [ __ ] deluxe bulbs in it remember now 444 20 blue and purple and then the veg no no that's our ones that are that there they weren't the cheapest things but they worked quite well I don't think I would spend the money again over the GP bulbs but I'm say long they actually last I even think most of this fixture is the veg high output nail there but we got the blue cheese it's still cruising along it's the smallest I mean it's not a big deal and then a couple of these they're still pretty small but the structures pretty good and all of them that one I like that one short and stacked and all that I want to say that's the ninja fruit of the ninja fruit it's always been the tallest of the bunch so hopefully that's not a male but everyone so we're gonna let these go like two more weeks pick up a couple more bags of dirt and up bottom will section first pair alarm oh pardon the interruption but we're done in the budget in anyway so nothing really special going on other than we hope the one is not a male and you know we'll have hot him a couple weeks one week or two we'll take them to like a number three pot but I want to sex them first I think they the pots are in this should be big enough after about a week let's say about a week from now they should be big enough most of them that they could be sexed but well uh I think we'll wait about two weeks before we do that yeah flower it looks good it's looking really good I only like little concern is this is the only one doing it but it's got a little bit of leaf curl turn in and then it's got a tiny bit of discoloration and just this one leaf set right here but this was the top top one when I dropped the light down so maybe that's a little light stress we'll see once I turn the plant again tonight and this gets farther away if anything shows in here kind of like that and if that goes away so I don't that don't mean the entire the entire thing looks healthy it's frosty well not super super frosty like compared to frost giant this time but I mean it's got its got frost going smells a little bit not too bad just like early flower stage stuff yeah this one looks really nice as well I mean what Obama's always been you know structured like this and stuff I mean I can't complain but what else is there to say bomb seeds is it's always really good these have always always turned out about the same I have been in here trying to like D leaf this one a little bit more to get some more light all the way down in it canopies pretty thick the widow bomb compared to that one that one's not bad it's really not these are some big fat indica leaves which I mean I like yeah okay touching that when I get the widow smell really I was saying they don't smell yet yeah oh it's a fantastic feeling guys it's it's so great to be back after like a year off but yeah sometimes you just need a break when [ __ ] happens you know powdery mildew I learned a lesson 81 degrees yeah 39 humidity our humidity was up 50 55 % the other day for about three days it wasn't too bad this we had rain come in but yeah I definitely I still need to get a little humidifier for in here but keeping it it like 40% it seems to be still pretty decent so I I'm not gonna complain yeah 630 screws along pretty good I do want to consider getting a 3k our bulb and switch out my 3k see how that does but I don't know it's hard and some dollar bulb right now just run an experiment well uh we'll get an idea of what these yield first time around anyways with this one and we'll go from there because then I can actually have numbers to compare a new bulb to old bulb all that fun stuff but sorry I didn't gets video up earlier on Friday just had a whole bunch going on marshmallow needed to go to the emergency vet on Wednesday and we were there until like 10 o'clock you just not go into good right now but you should be alright a couple weeks give him some antibiotics and everything getting back to you know full health and then we've got mr. Rizzo he's always gonna be in at least one video he'd be in super cuddle cats they it's kind of Awesome he never lets me scratch his belly and he wanted belly rubs today thank you but I think that's gonna be it for this video guys short sweet little bit of a late upload again apologizes personal stuff going on but you know expect the next one Friday at noon we're gonna kind of try and stay on that schedule I like that so thank you all for the support and you know don't forget about the giveaway the more of you guys that like comment and subscribe most importantly the quicker we get to 2,500 the quicker I can give you guys you know some bomb gear for free and if main may not be these I kind of doubt it but we'll see I should have some input with bomb on what you know goes to you guys and maybe we'll put up a poll and see what you guys want when the time comes to or would like to see potentially so yeah let me know if you want to see something like that and we'll do it next video till then peace", "B2Xqu0AX93Q": "hey everyone welcome to greenbox to lead on boxing Channel today we've got some franco's lemon cheese from first harvest this is another strain hunters it has seventeen point nine percent THC and less than five percent CVD less than one percent CD sorry tennesippi bag and the packaged date is February fourteenth twenty twenty so we have three and a half grams here [Music] do you guys like this if you day sir - are you like me and not a huge fan okay it's not that I hate them I don't mind them it's just you see how squished that butt is in that corner this bud like this is like flat and that's really the only one it like the main reason why I don't like the zippy bags that and it gets stuck and I'm special and I don't like to read the directions and I can't open so yeah let me know your opinion I do find some of the containers are really big though for what you're getting I feel like they're starting to kind of like get the grasp of it I just don't want to break these because it does seem really dry I want to keep it as intact as I can so I'll just get a wait first look at it three point three so just looking at the bug I'd see it's kind of like straining very long looking leaves I'm very dry it would benefit from a humidity pack I think but maybe it'll bust up okay just like these buds seem really like fluffy like if you look at this one how bushy it kind of is and then like because it's flat you can see not overly dense buds but then it's got like a a grass kind of smell to it it smells like outside someone just mowed the lawn or something and I'm just gonna bust up a couple of the smaller ones so I can get good pictures with the big buttons ok so it's not like it is fairly dry but it's not as bad as the buds gonna see looks like this oh another seat a few seats it's not very often that I find seeds and bagel weeds but it happens so if we leave color it's like a medium green got it has quite a few hairs and the buds I have like a light coat of crystal on it and then you don't see the hairs as much when it's busted it's still a decent amount of crystal Franko's lemon cheese from first harvest is more of a mellow happy high so the nugs in this packet were pretty squished and overall aesthetically they did not look very nice but I would try it again just to see what the package is like just like if it's similar experience if you have tried it let me know how it went for you like and subscribe and yeah thanks for watching [Music]", "BEUwIhcl5co": "hi i'm the top shelf grower and welcome to episode 10 of the big cheese as we step inside the grow tent 26 days into the bloom period not quite at the end of week four but we're taking a peek-a-boo inside right now because i reckon we're roughly about halfway through that bloom period and we've got some lovely flare formations beginning to happen and i gotta say it's been quite a while since i've had such an alluring looking growth and as this so we're gonna pick it up with a closer look if i can squeeze myself in here without knocking anything over with my absolute favorite pick of the litter right here the double baked cheesecake get a load of this looks like we're gonna have a pretty tasty central main cola there but we're also gonna get some lovely secondary shoots here producing some nice nice chunky boards and we go in here down on the bottom you'll see that little bit of lollipop and we did back in you know the end of week two beginning the week three of them has really paid dividends because what we're doing is driving all that energy into nice big chunky buds at the top of the branches aside from that and don't haven't really done any other pruning but that's something i'll get back to that in a moment okay let's take a look now to the right our super skunk by scentsy seeds also looking outstanding again i think we're gonna have a lovely big main cola there and some pretty decent branches there along the side this one branched out lovely as well plenty of secondary shoots okay and then if i can slip myself back outside the roadhead in the front here propped up just a little bit is our chewy cheese also looking very impressive again three in a row lovely big chunky hopefully another trophy cola in the making there and the secondary shoot grow prolific looking good and again the lollipopping paying dividends so we're driving that energy into flaring tops for maximum yield okay now let's move over here see if my term hygrometer is cooperating just about so we're keeping temperatures consistent about 25 degrees celsius so we got 24.9 there i know it's hard to read the bottom the relative humidity 60 so that's right about spot on for this point in the bloom cycle okay now in order to maintain that what i've got also running in here is handy little efficient 20 watt dehumidifier check and outside here i've got a lovely it's very simple cheap and cheerful oscillating fan just keeping you know a little bit of a breeze on them not too much don't want to be giving them wind burn just enough to keep that air flowing around okay and what most interesting of all this week we have got our spider farmer sf2000 led within 15 inches of the plant canopy so you wouldn't dare do that now with the old-fashioned hid lights because all these have to be all burned and yellow but you really can't get them in close okay with this this kind of technology the full spectrum led is working like magic for me and i i had my doubts about this technology over the years but i think spider farmer have really absolutely nailed it so this is how we're going to be growing in the 21st century no more that old school 20 20th century technology no thank you i don't think there's any going back at this point okay now just to round out this week's update i want to touch a little bit on the nutrients okay so we're going with where i'm doing my best to maintain 100 organic inputs okay and we're not going crazy with our doses okay so it's pretty simple we we're working up from a baseline of one milliliter per liter of the bloom we're now up to two milliliters per liter of our base nutrient bloom that's the iguana juice by advanced nutrients and to supplement that and really give these flowers a bit of a you know a push i'm also blending in some top max by biobiz and occasionally i like to add a little bit of bio heaven too both of those at the application rate of two milliliters per liter so keep it simple incrementally making your increases not blasting them out of it with chemicals and not really doubling down on your organics neither just keep it slow and steady and consistent that's all they need it's not about how much you can feed them it's about giving them just the right amount okay now what else before before we wrap this one up okay yeah you've probably noticed that we are missing our clones here that well they were here on the right hand side they have now safely transitioned to the great outdoors so in the in the coming outdoor series get ready to be seeing more of the double baked cheesecake because we've got two of these and they come from the very bottom down here as you can see we'll zoom in there you go cut those branches off at the bottom that you might just throw away oh no definitely don't with these these are precious genetics folks and i'm so glad i took them this plant is an outstanding specimen and probably my favorite the picket litter so you're gonna have two more of those clones we're gonna see that and get them again soon and we got one further clone from our chewy cheese in the front here as you can see just showing you there we did it the only bit of pruning and training we've done so far is a little bit of lollipop and that's just to drive that plant energy into the main tops here okay so we're going to maximize our yield without going too nuts so if you are a beginner grower it's very doable all you have to do is scroll back a few episodes and you can see how the lollipop yourself now in the weeks to come what may be necessary as you can see here we take a view from the top is we have quite a few shading fan leaves particularly here now with the chewy cheese so the only little modification i might do as flareon progresses into the ladder stages what i'm doing now is i'm kind of just folding them out of the way so we can let these shoots get more light penetration likewise here and a little bit on the super skunk so we're just gonna prune as and when needed keeping it simple folks okay that's all for this episode i'll be back again real soon and hopefully we should be seeing some trophy colas emerging from all three of these specimens until next time folks don't forget please like and subscribe for more on the top shelf grower i'll see you again soon have a great day folks bye bye", "GSfUIpYDnc4": "homonym bread sandwich in clove is iike \u00e9litaire say hello to Tom bread sandwich capture and

"hey guys what's up it's alex from elevated again and today we're gonna do a strain review of orange hair ombre brought to you by a gardener the buds [Music] orange Harambee is a mixture of Harambee crossed with mandarin sunset it's tested at twenty three point four percent THC and less than one percent in sea wheedies let's take a look oh yeah looks really nice and that smells really sweet too not a lot of frost enos but i can definitely see the trichrome formation on there looks great definitely i see a little bit of sativa popping out in this and the way just it looks and the hairs and the nugget structure itself i'm guessing this is probably gonna be more of the phenotype since it is a hybrid of sativa just by the way the nugget structure is and how the trichomes are formed you can always tell by looking at the trichomes and the sugar leaves and just in the formation of the bud itself to see what type of phenotypes are more dominant in the string mmm smells good let's go ahead and give it a pinch test real quick that smells amazing nice sweet spicy a little bit of citrus smells amazing i always like to give a nice pinch to the bud as usual just to get that nice smell but my favorite way to get the smell from it is definitely a grinder test so let's break up a couple pieces don't forget when you're grinding up your dry herbs make sure you take the stems out because that will affect the flavor when you're trying to extract the best flavor profile from them so I have 1/2 gram that I'm grinding up we like to be consistent with our testing nice sweet yet spicy at the same time almost smells like an orange peel you always want to give a nice smell in judging dried herbs just because their nose is a big part of how you taste also so when you're tasting the dried herb itself mostly is coming from your olfactory system now that we've judged the visual aesthetics and the smell let's go ahead and grab a vaporizer and we'll go ahead and taste some of this I'll be back in just a moment so now that we have a half gram of our dried herbs ground up in our grinder let's take about half and fill it up in the vaporizer we use the vaporizer just because it extracts the best flavor profile when judging dried herbs now that I have my wand loaded up let's go ahead and give it a nice flavor test I have a nice water rig to cool the vapor that I use let's go ahead and get down with the get-down it's got a nice sweet taste to it I mean it's super sweet not much of a citrus taste to it as I had before but almost like a sour taste it's it's really delicious it still has that like spicy almost like I wouldn't call it earthy but almost like peppery taste at the very end also when using the vaporizer or even a bowl for that matter you want to give it a nice stir make sure your dried herbs are nice and evenly distributed that way the surface area is getting mixed up and you're pulling that hot air over top of everything and not just the beginning part of it it's given another one Cheers oh yeah much bigger that's the that's a positive thing about stirring when you're stirring the dried herbs it also just gives you a big white cloud and sometimes that's what it needs so it looks like I got about five to six nice pulls off that with the flavors starting to go away run around four now that we're done vaporizing I'm going to go ahead and give it a nice combustion test it's good to see after it combusts because the ash itself changes color when it's not treated properly I'm gonna get rid of the vaporizer and then we'll move along to the bowl combustion test time Cheers [Music] yeah so as I'm smoking it it's kind of harsh on the throat crackles a little bit which I don't really like that much we'll go ahead and burn through the rest of this pipe here but whew that's definitely not as smooth as the vaporizer its burden it's not how much flavor is I'd like to see in a board cell especially a nice clean one like that and the crackling itself kind of indicates that maybe I hasn't been flushed properly maybe it's been rushed I'm not really sure but it's not as smooth as some of the product that comes out of there are Gardens I've had before come back with you in just a moment I'll give you a full rating than what we think about the orange murabba here at elevate percents so now we're going to do the rating system the orange Harambee had a great visual aesthetics but it's also known for a great calyx formation which I didn't see there but we still gave it a six point seven it had an amazing trichrome structure and it was still kind of frosty with a nice mint green for aroma I gave us six point five I loved it when it was ground up and had a nice spicy and sweet sour smell to it for the taste when I vaporized it it tasted quite delicious I loved it a lot I had a nice flavor to it but unfortunately when I smoked it with the hemp wick and him through the pipe it kind of it was a little bit crackly and just led me to believe it may have not been flushed properly but I still gave it a six point one for taste for the user experience we gave it a five point eight because I didn't think it was flushed properly and it crackled and kind of hurt my throat as I smoked it let me take off just a little bit more than I usually do so that's why I didn't give it a very high score for that category for the effects when we rated it out on an eight point system I gave it a six point nine it was an amazing body high I felt very uplifted I felt very inspired to do things it was an extreme head rush but not too cerebral high so I liked it a lot so overall I gave the strain orange harambe my garden of the buds a six point four it was an amazing high I really liked it a lot it was actually really tasty too to the vaporizer unfortunately it got a little low score because of the combustion test and as for me I'm Alex with elevate hope to see it next time if you like what we do make sure you hit like subscribe right there right there and I'll do it for you see you next time Thanks [Music] so I scrapped the bowl and fill up the rest of the dried herb that we have all right", "f4knnia5Rrw": "yo what's up YouTube today's Tuesday September 30th thought I give you guys an update on the flower tent and show you guys how they are looking on day 30 everything has been pretty good over here in this corner we have a blue cheese then we have hindu kush in that corner we have cheese stumper right there blue cheese times live in stomper and we have a holy girl right here she's pretty tall that's like me the cameras like add my shoulder length so that's at my shoulder link right there she's pretty tall um then we have a love Jones right here and she is on about 78 days already then we have a power nap that's on about seven or eight days to a little bit probably not maybe around five days but imma considered at the same time as this one so we'll just say we'll just say these at a week today I'm and then I have some of the projects going in here already I'm just face that they're going to flower out actually in these little small Solo cups we have a cheese thumper mail we have a cheese stump or female and then we have a blue cheese over there um the mail is only going to stay in here and so it starts to show a little bit more of its little um sex and then same thing with the females and then we're all we're going to take them out and put them in another room um pollinate them in their pollinate them in there and then bring them back in here to finish off but as for now I just want them to show a little bit more before I actually put another light up that's 12 12 but but they're looking pretty good they have enough light to actually survive in here I'm looking pretty good we have this lady she's actually in a five gallon pot I don't think I'm not expecting her to fill it up but I gave her enough room for her her roots to grow into but I'm more than sure she's not enough left to five gallon and then the rest are also in three gallons I'm believing now that the Holy Grail and the Hindu Kush is at least a ten week or longer strain they're not really putting on any type of weight yet they're still just packing on real slowly and that's usually a sign of a long week strain same thing with the Holy Grail they're pretty much in the same stage they just have little small but sites just not nothing that's really packing on any weight yet so I'm thinking there at least a 10 week or plus strain we have my eight to nine weeks train right here and she's already touching everything this is the blue cheese this actually is the mom of the chief thumper and she's actually packed on a lot more frost since the last video she's actually getting a lot more froster than this too but she's looking pretty good there on day 30 pretty much everything here except for this little corner over here I'm these one here today the breeding projects for f2s and back cross with the mom and then that this one and this one's been in here for about seven days eight days we still have one more new york's to diesel down there i'm waiting to be sex male or female I'm the power nap that was next foot was actually a male I kept saying it was a female cuz I thought it was was actually a male so I chopped it down sorry I that just went today with the me turn this down or maybe oh it stopped or faster so i can show you guys my bed if you guys hear the fan i'll show you guys a little bit of the cheese stomper if i can fit in here she's not really packing on any frost yet she does have frost though but she's just not as frosty it's her mom yet so i'm hopefully um hopefully it's just taking a little bit longer than I expected but there is frost and it is packing on this actually has more than the head last night I can tell already because i was looking at last night I guess just overnight packed on a little bit more but she's looking still pretty good i hope i'm hoping that it's just gonna show a little bit more later on because of right now the cross i thought was gonna be really good so I'm hoping that it looks a little bit better later on but for now it just kind of 10 disappointing it that she would be at least as frothy as her mom so maybe just the backcross will be a lot better than f 2 so bright now unless she shows a little bit more but for now she's okay she's just normal frost we have a little bit maybe just this leaf right here and I think maybe a couple other ones we're having a little bit of I believe phosphorus deficiency I'm pretty sure that's what it is I don't my phones and focus on that but it's not burnt it's more of like a purple burnt into it more like a phosphorus deficiency so I'm actually flushed her out just a little bit i gave her like not too sure maybe like two liters of just ph RO water and then the next day when i fed these ones i gave her back nutrients again so that's usually how i do a flush i usually give her enough water before and then feed her the next day so she has water to soak up all night and then the next day give some more nutrients and i think just that little bit of time actually i'll have yellowed her out a little bit more gave her like a little bit of maybe I'm thinking iron deficiency that Suzie were iron starts in the middle and spreads out side of your leaves unlike other deficiencies like say magnesium our calcium our nitrogen where it starts usually on the outside of your thief's and go inwards so that's how you use you can tell the difference between nitrogen calcium and iron deficiencies irons always starts in the middle of your buds and spread out and the rest usually start from the outside and spread in words so that's usually the way you can tell so I'm believing it's a little bit of an iron deficiency which already had it usually when I flip my that's a 1212 I always get a bit of yellow ink on in the middle usually a sign of iron deficiency something to worry about I just get a little bit more of what was like giving it make sure you guys what I'm actually feeding these ladies right before I stop this video show you guys what I'm giving it so what I'm feeding it in here i'm giving it i'm giving it molasses i'm giving it pure plenty i'm giving it cal-mag cali magic i'm giving it a tiger bloom i'm giving it hydro plex from botanicare this is my peek-a-boos pretty much all I got I'm giving it epson salt if needed night I don't give a nitrogen that's pretty much it I don't give any silica blast inside flower I did one year for two groves and it seemed like it just made my buds a little bit harsh there's a couple people that can disagree and say it doesn't do it what there's but it might have been just what I was doing something different but I took this out and after I stopped giving this it seemed like that harshness went away so that's pretty much all I'm giving molasses Hydra Plex pure blend tea cali magic tiger bloom some epson salt and that's pretty much basically it so that's pretty much it for the flower 10 update on day 30 I keep you guys updated everything else and you guys will see what that last one I'm hoping it's a male that new york city diesel down there because i do have to you know so but i'm going to be putting another new york i'm gonna put the other new york's and diesel in here and flower it out since i already have clones of it so we had to see that in here pretty soon on next update that's pretty much it on day 30 please", "lfVldMrCrOg": "[Music] welcome to another episode of the world according to

reasons our tables make medical marijuana oh yeah I also wanted to say that distillates and the Turks started working amazing I haven't taken any of that so I was waiting to talk to my shower I mixed some of that and made a little bit from what cartridge that takes a pure tangi just oh shout out to search art take a dick a quick step a screenshot of that if you don't have a good idea of a turf chart those flavors and smells are what gives you an indication of what the natural flower is doing you know if you got like a earthy woody herbal that's like a human lien so that's gonna be good for like anti-inflammatory appetite suppressant pain relief anti tumour the humans specifically so those earthy or woody flavors are like good for like you know different types of things like that so you know each each one like the pining and my mayor scene and my Moline each have their own areas you know there's different flavors do different things like a spicy or woody or peppery will usually be a pain relief antidepressant anti-inflammatory and anti-tank so each one is a little different like I said take a screen shot of that and definitely study it you can oftentimes determine from your taste

sweet so yeah good stuff amazing can't say enough about their delivery crew Mike shout out to the driver and everybody on the delivery end from their internet crew to their phone service they've all been amazing I've got the delivery here within 24 hours which is what I always hope for and you know sometimes it doesn't happen and sometimes it happens faster than that like when one last week was in 12 hours I need to give them a video about their reception time but we'll talk more about that next week I'm definitely gonna be doing a video about how long it takes for some companies and other

what's up guys I'm Matt this is mr. Canucks grow and welcome to the wheat you calm really appreciate you following me we've taken one month off so we have a fair bit to catch up on so let's just start it off in the 5x5 row where we have the chem dog and black dog left to take out Charlie big kind of flower but we did have two other plants in here which were harvested a week earlier during week nine that was the peppermint kush incredible everything is now harvested and drying so it's time to clean up and get this 5x5 reset for the next row which is gonna be turned into a bedroom we have a whole nother grow already for flower which were phenyl hunting so we're gonna be taking chrome cuts and putting them in here [Music] [Music] in this beautiful closet grow featuring the electric sky es 300 LEDs I have five plants in total which are ready to be flipped in the flower so I went ahead and took some clones as well as prep the plants for flower by the foliated as well as lollipop the strains I'm taking cuttings from are to Pinos of cookies from Canuck C's which is a Girl Scout cookie cross from them I also have their Gorilla Glue which I have to be knows of and I have a new Phenom of Black Dog as well as a pineapple chunk were running so lately I've been planting my clones in sell pots with pure cocoa I just find this has better control on keeping the medium hydrated over the rockwool cubes what's very nice about this is you can actually veg your plant out a bit in these cell pots the Rock will tubes after 10 to 14 days you've got roots and you need a transplant these allow you to go a little bit longer so to help kick-start these clones I am gonna be using an IBA rooting hormone powder this just helps reduce the bench time of propagation basically gets those roots going a little bit quicker than if you didn't use it but let's finish these clones up and get on over to install the trellis net [Music] [Music] [Music] so here we are in the closet grow and we're finally ready to flip the flower we've had a pretty long veg on these girls but before we go and flip the flower we got to get a trellis installed because I know for a fact we're gonna have issues with bud flopping over if we don't do this [Music] the only tip I have when it comes to installing any kind of trellis netting is making sure it's snug and tight otherwise it won't be doing its job but like I said we're ready to flip the flower so we're gonna go ahead and switch that light cycle from 18 6 to 12 12 and K week one o flower started [Music] only after a couple days of flower I was getting pretty excited because I noticed this trellis was working out great the entire canopy was filled wall-to-wall with that being said we're gonna fast-forward right before flower as of right now this grow is shaping up to be one of the best from start to finish I've ever had the veg on this Grove was incredibly successful under the electric sky LEDs the plants were kept very healthy with no deficiencies using Gaia green organic dry amendments these shots are from the middle of week four and the es 300 really produced a tight no structure and adding the new trellis net combined with the linear lenses from the LEDs would provide an equal par spread I was able to get this entire canopy very even wall to wall if you're interested in the electric Sky LEDs I do have a coupon code down below in the description that will hook you up with five percent off your purchase and get you free shipping anywhere in the United States as well as Canada really excited for these cookies and gorilla glue number four fee knows from Canucks seeds I'm seeing some Lee is actually starting to taco with frost rails on the cookies he knows let's go ahead and get close to get a better look [Music] now don't forget I have a brand new Fino of blackjack from humble seed organization in this bro it's definitely looking very nice one of the nicer black dog he knows I had half grown I've done black dog numerous times not overly excited about this because of the cookies and Gorilla Glue stealing all of the black dogs thunder but I am happy to say that this is going good you can see we do have a little bit of a fade some light green coming in on some of these phyno so I did go ahead and top dress them to address that issue so just a couple important announcements to update everyone moving forward I will be switching from

it growing everyone welcome to yet another episode of beginner buds the channel for beginners by beginners last week our girls got the first taste of nutrients and boy were they loving it as we looked on growth was beyond phenomenal as new notes continue to pop off even better yet future bud sites finally made their arrival meaning that we were doing something right but the ladies tucked away and growing in their tent there were a few more things we could do in order to give them the most help possible considering the environment first thing was first though we wanted to make sure our plants stayed low and spread out ensuring that the light could cover every square inch of those beautiful families aka the plants solar panels that said this week was all about topping and our girls were about to get a haircut so let's get into it [Music] [Music] alright guys so things are starting to get exciting at this point our ladies are starting to take some serious strides and there seems to be no stopping them what the girls finally being allowed to eat like they want it was immediately clear that this is what they've been waiting for just like that leaf after leaf started to grow with nodes shooting out intensely even better yet we were starting to see future bud sights arise showing us exactly where those long awaited flowers would one day be waiting for us unfortunately it wasn't long before we hit yet another snag now you may remember that in the beginning we made a mistake or two and that seems to be far from over remember we're beginners and we're not afraid of mistakes in fact that's the only way that anyone learns when first starting out that said it was time for yet another lesson and this one was in being able to read our plants on an individual basis sure we had a general nutrient schedule going but the best thing you can do for your girls is actually spend time to learn what you're giving them and why too bad for us we are about to learn this the hard way with a few of our smaller ladies after upping our newts it looked like a few of our girls should have been kept back on a lighter dose within a day or so we realized some discoloring on their leaves of course this yellow pigment shows up a lot better under the purple lights we have but it was still quite noticeable under regular lights as well regardless we knew we needed to take action and took the struggling plants to the bath tub to flush them now for those that don't know flushing can be done for a few reasons it can be done at the end of a grow cycle or to correct the nutrient lock out for us though we were flushing our pots because we thought we went in too strong with our newts sadly we'd lay to find out that this actually wasn't the case and that we were only making things worse with a flush but you'll have to tune in next week to see what really happened and just how bad things were about to get either way when flushing your plants you want to use water that has been dechlorinated and pH balanced and maybe depending on your situation half of the regular dose of nutrients just like that the girls were put back and it was time to ensure the rest had the best chance that they could in our tent for that it was time to do a little talking [Music] as we later learned this was a little more intimidating than it should have been of course you're actually chopping off a piece of your little girls that you're hoping to grow big and beautiful so it's perfectly understandable to be nervous however topping is rather simple as many of you already know cannabis plants have a natural tendency to grow main Cola straight up the middle of the plant that said the goal with topping is to avert this natural grow pattern in fact what we're trying to create here is several main colas all around the plant that stay low and spread out ensuring they receive equal light and nutrients in the end what people who top their plants are hoping for is a bigger and more consistent yield that said the process is easy in general people tend to top at the fifth or sixth node simply put a node as a growth of leaves if you look at your plant you will see that the leaves grow straight across from one another when two new leaves grow further up the stem that shoot off 90 degrees in the other direction as the leaves below them this is called a node one thing I just want to add here is that future bud sites grow right in the crotch of each node and you are not going to want to damage these when carrying out this process although some people use their fingernails to top their plants we decided to go with a pair of sharp pointed scissors to ensure accuracy [Music] [Music] just like that the girls were locked in the juices immediately started flowing although our ladies had begun to smell up our tent a little bit this was the first major time we could get a good whiff of that terpenes contained within these ladies and it only made us that much more excited about what we were doing of course there's a long road ahead of us but tune in next week as we try to help our girls out a little bit more with some LST or low stress training once again we're trying to keep these girls spread out so that light can penetrate to all parts of the plant and this is a pretty big step [Music] feel free to follow us on Instagram or Twitter and we just started a Facebook page and snapchat account for those who would prefer those branches of social media as well in the meantime keep growing keep learning catch you later guys [Music]", "5yYjLJNUxB4": "hi there can a family welcome back now first off I got to say sorry about the glitching here I don't know what's going on with my camera it never used to do this but it just started recently and I'm starting to

update here all righty here we go in the little 2x4 tip Dubai for we sound here when I say that but as you can see these ladies are looking at pretty not trying these things I don't know if they're any do it they're Chinese Chinese carbon dioxide pills you want yeah I think they're kind of phony-baloney but I'm giving it a shot it's not hurt that's and in the world of water just water today no nutrients I go back and forth between nutrients and just water so I basically flush them every other day not that I think them everyday I just need them as they as they're thirsty pretty much every day but not always did it get fed yesterday because they were holding the water watch well at this point we only got probably two or three more weeks at max and then it's gonna be harvested I definitely stunted these girls a little bit at this time as compared other times good indeed here's the runt who the girlfriend has named Peter Dinklage is it shortened or shortened pretty rad and these four over here are all the CBD cheese the bud stacks very interesting-looking it's hard to really really show I know this camera doesn't do it very good justice I will maybe get a better camera one day I don't know life do what I had actually tried it's hard to show you what this camera here does a big twist so it does this it goes up and then a twist and this is all the Cola right here this is coming from from the top like that this guy over here is doing the same one it's big blood right here the spiral sort of thing it's kind of right there with all these girls I kind of did this spiral effect these ones in the back here these sour girls see I know the color is really washed out but they are looking pretty nice really starting to pack on some crystal formations look it's very cool they smell wonderful now the genetics on these are early myths and Sour Diesel they call it sour girl all my seeds are from good old crop gang seeds in Vancouver Canada oh I got a I got a low battery warning I think that's probably where I'm gonna end this episode and I just wanted to give you guys a little update on the on the little grow here man it's looking mighty good and I did make a cool deal with a light company so I'm gonna have better lights for the next grow probably not for this one I'm gonna have to tough it out with what I got but I do got some better lights coming eventually but I got a little deal going that's gonna get me a better light so that'll be pretty awesome so next girl will be even better anyway I'll see you guys real soon I'll be into but another

really done a one-up here I mean look at these trichomes they are developed completely across this entire flower and there is still a quite a presence of these orange to dark brown hairs this was an enjoyable flower and it gets more enjoyable as you sit down and realize that your milligrams per price is actually awesome at twenty eight dollars for the eighth you really can't beat this now they still do provide free delivery if I'm not mistaken which is slightly misleading to say because even with the Pensacola location in the Panama City Beach location they're still on their website saying that there is no delivery to the pain handle areas so for us we're still struggling out there but I guess for the rest of the state enjoy your free delivery because I'm still salty with Liberty Health

"hi my name is Maya and today I'm gonna be showing you how to can handle a blue cheese today I'm going to be using vintage Winstar blue by the white stone cheese company so we're going to start off with a clean bench we're going to take this out of its wrapping which unlike the other cheese's is partially made from foil this cheese is very delicate and will crumble when you cut through it so we're going to have to be careful so to cut this you want to use a cheese knife with holes and you just want to pierce through the exposed pre-cut part of the wheel as this is only a typical half of a vintage winter blue wheel starting from the middle and slicing outwards from the center creating our fabulous blue cheese which now you may be able to see remnants of the cheese crumble off of my knife because just like I say this cheese is very delicate and is very prone to cracking solely because of its unique structure now we want to be wrapping this particular cheese and foil as it discontinues any airflow whatsoever preventing the cheese from further molding this is just normal baking foil you use in your kitchen at home it's not fancy stuff but it does the trick if you find a foil wrap there has a paper lining that would work even better as it has much of a less harsh a surface to come into contact with the cheese be careful with the wrapping of this cheese as miss hande the foil can cause it to tear quite easily pack the sides down tight ensuring that there are no exposed surfaces of the blue cheese securing this cheese wood tape is optional as the foil holds quite well but you can if you feel that it needs to cheese is very porous similar to a sponge and in saying that will act like a sponge when you put it in your fridge absorbing any aromas it is kept with hence the importance of where and how we store the cheese protecting it is key to its flavor now ensuring you do not contaminate your next cheese wipe the knife with a damp cloth as well as your work surface according to New Zealand's safety guidelines if you do not intend to mature the cheese any longer as a rule of thumb store the cheese between 1 and 4 degrees Celsius regardless of its classification to store the rest of the wheel you'll want to return it to its original packaging securing all of the open sides of the packaging making sure that it's not exposed to the air it is best to keep this cheese at a temperature of anywhere between five point five and seven point five degrees Celsius with 85 to 95 percent humidity in the air", "ExBsreZUh78": "alright we're going to start out by taking a look at the first terrain I'm growing which is afgoo ask use a hybrid strain I think it's a combination of a female afghan and a male Maui haze THC level is about nineteen eighteen to nineteen percent it's good for insomnia pain and stress and its top effect is euphoric so let's go in here and take a look at this first plan on growing so this is about 45 days from when I got it as a clone in a cup she grew pretty quick up to about 16 inches and i cropped her and at that point she took off again i think we're up to about two and a half feet beautiful heads I've done a little bit of low stress training here on some of the branches to bring it out and we've still got a lot of little shoots coming out today is the first day of the 12 hour light cycle we've changed to a sodium light and so we're going into in the flowering mode hopefully in a few weeks we'll be able to see something good the thing I like about this plant is it's got gorgeous leaves very thick and compact here where the buds are coming out and great color it's really fill out fabulously along the top as compared to the AK forty-sevens I've got so I really AM am tempted to keep this plant and just grow it for six months to a year and see what it'll do but I can do that with some of the other ones let's see how this one produces and i'll be making a follow up video at harvest time", "VHrDPLLdy4Y": "Buongiorno! Welcome to another episode\nof Rufus Eats Cheese.  Today we are in Italy for beautiful Gorgonzola and\nGorgonzola. A lot of you have been asking questions about Gorgonzola and I can't\nbelieve how many people search Google and YouTube for Gorgonzola so I thought\nI should really oblige now we've got two pieces of Gorgonzola here they're made\nin the same place the difference main difference between the two is their age\nso bitter history Gorgonzola is achieved as a Protected Designation of Origin so\nit can only be made in the Piedmonte and Lombardy regions of Italy and it has to be\nmade from pasteurized cow's milk so you can't sort of make it out of sheep's\nmilk or you know unpasteurized milk or a mixture or something it also has to be\nwhole milk so it's not skimmed it's full fat natural milk they take the raw milk\nfrom the cows pasteurize it they mix in a blend of yeast and they also add\nrennet, rennet causes the milk to curdle so yeah, curds and whey once it's cooled \na little and it's then a roughly blood temperature body temperature they add a\nmold to the cheese.. now I apologise I previously said in my blue cheese video\nup here I previously said that all these cheeses that I were in that video had\nPenicillium roqueforti in it. They don't. Gorgonzola\nhas Penicillium glaucum in it which is a different type of penicillin mould.\nLike the roqueforti, it requires air for it to grow so you can see across both these\ncheeses there are stripes across here and this\nis where the cheese once made is then spiked metal spikes to allow air in and\nthat allows the cheese to bloom and the hyphae to grow throughout the cheese. You\ncan probably see on both these cheeses here, this one it's quite firm on the\nedge here but the inside here is really quite gooey almost wants to kind of\npaste it's super-super gooey same on this one if not more so even on this one\nthis one's even drier and firmer on the edge and super gooey in the middle so\nthis would be the middle of the cheese and when you have a wedge of cheese like\nthis this is known as the nose and it's extremely bad etiquette really bad\netiquette to chop the nose off and eat it because basically you're taking away\nthat best bit of the cheese from everyone else\nyou should always cut cheese in the line so it's from the outside to the inside\nso what's the main difference between these two bits of cheese we've I got two - why haven't I just got the one piece? Well, this one is Gorgonzola Dolce\nso this is a sweet version so this is not matured for as long it has a really\nkind of like creamy flavour and if people are not really sure if they want to try\nblue cheese or they think they don't like blue cheese maybe someone gave me a\npiece of Stilton or something before and it kind of blew their head off this is\none to try particularly this lovely gooey bit here it's there's nothing\noffensive about it you're gonna just a very gentle tang from the blue in the\ncheese this one over here is the picante version which is the kind of mature\nversion if you like so it's a stronger flavor and it's a little bit firmer and\nit's matured for longer so I think we need to do is to try them both doing so\nI've got my trusty almonds on around here this can be particularly difficult\nessentially tasting the same cheese so we'll see what we can do okay let's give\nthis one in turn here well I'd rather like the rind but and\nthen I go for this bit in the middle without any rind first does just about\nhold together though doesn't it but it's super floppity little piece of that down\nand I'm gonna go right over the middle I think let's have a little look at this\npiece here ah their nose is amazing really beautiful so the first thing you get from the nose\nis there some lactic notes to it you can tell it's kind of a dairy product which\nmight sound surprising but sometimes you can't you don't get any of that when you\nsmell cheese you get something more like mushroom it kind of flavors well nutty\nsaid this one does have a lot of mushroom going on you can really get\nthat kind of truffle II kind of smell from it but you do also get the lactic\nnerve as well try actually sorry it's a that's absolutely gorgeous\nso it's it's sweet it's almost caramely it's not just sweet like sugar it's\nsweet like nectar or like honey or caramel it's got some real body to it\nbut then carries on developing then you get those beautiful buttery Ness that's\nsomewhere between if you live somewhere you can get clotted cream or really\nheavy rich cream you get all that flavor add a battery ness to it but now that's\nmore or less gone and I'm now getting some sourness like more lively ogre kind\nof flavor the lactic tones and I'm also getting much more bitterness now from\nthe vein so at first there's none of that you don't taste any of it you get\nthe hint of mushroom when you taste it the sweetness now the flavors still\ngoing it's now mellow right out and I'm just left with a really nice mmm really\nnice nutty mushroomy kind of flavor like um with some definite buttery notes to\nit so it's like at the end everyone comes back and kind of joins the party\nso really special that's beautiful I'm gonna have another piece this is from a\nlittle bit further in the nose now this bit has a little more tartness\nto so where I get the piece from the nose here was very sweet I'm not quite\ngetting that sweetness from here so let's try this shall we mmm gorgeous texture it's firm it holds\ntogether it's almost Turkish Delight or something which I don't like by the way\nwithout the Rose flavor hmm that's actually much more mellow\nwhich is what we'd expect really so the middle of the cheese if you imagine this\nbeing a wheel the middle of the cheese will be the bit that matures the most\nit's usually really gorgeous flavor hence there being bad etiquette to cut\nher nose off me - no that's really quite different there's a bit more mushroom\nthere's less sweetness there's a little more of that tart bitterness from the\nright but still really good and a beautiful combination all of them\ntogether is really really fantastic now that's what I'm gonna do here I happen\nto know that I love the rind if you can see the rind on here there's a kind of\ngrey blue yeast bloom on the outside here so I'm going to cut this off this\nway hmm I'm very different again hmm much\nmore nutty there's much more nuttiness to it it's still sweet but it doesn't\nhave that caramel kind of hint not really hint that was going on with the\nnose it's really rather different so that's three sections of the same cheese\nthe same piece of cheese all tasting quite different I'm now getting I'm now\ngetting a more nuttiness to it so much more truffle and nuts\nrather than lactic tones and caramel what a fantastic cheese that's amazing\nright I'm gonna grab a few almonds here now really good to cleanser palette\nespecially because I'm gonna be eating essentially the same cheese same again\nI'm gonna take a wedge that's absolutely magnificent I can only\njust pick that up it's really really soft really soft and beautiful and it's\ngot just enough strength to keep its integrity let's give it a try hmm so\nstrain wears no messing around strapped in with those blue tones hmm you're not\ngetting buttery flavors anymore we're getting more become much more tasted\nit's a cream cheese rather than buttery dairy um but almost immediately you get\nthose blue notes come in and they just get stronger and stronger and stronger\nit's still getting stronger in my mouth now now it's weird because the mmm\nthat's so good the first flavor from here is really there's really no messing\naround straight with the blue flavor and then you start to get some lactic tones\nas well and it's getting more and more bitter and in a good way I don't\ngenerally like bitter things but this is really hitting the spot mmm oh that's so\ngood right so the same test again I'm gonna go with what's a beautiful right\nlet's try at a proper soccer that's a proper\nSucker Punch where's no rushin around with that\nstraighten with the blue yeah it got so much with it it's not just blue you get\nall this lovely kind of cream cheese imagine eating a really nice fresh cream\ncheese with something intensely blue you have that lovely mixture it's so\ndifferent from the Dolce the with him here we have these with the nose we had\nkind of caramel tones and a slight hint of blue and as we move down the color\nchange this is taking no prisoners if you are keen on blue cheese I would not\ntry the picante unless you're feeling brave and you kind of want to you know\nsee the error of your ways you want to try and do something about\nit so I'm just going to cut this piece off here right you got this is much softer than the edge of the\npecan tree here and the mold on the edge here looks a little different a little\nbit different yeah you can really tell them the nose beautiful amazing news on\nit that's so beautiful it's so so good both\nthese cheeses are excellent now personally I like almost every\ncheese there's very few things that are like the only exceptions really a goat\ncheese but that's more an allergy thing but you'd be happy with either of these\ncheese's the only thing that will differ would be whether you are not so much of\na blue cheese fan then you maybe want to go for this one it's not too pokey it's\na nice kind of introduction if you like to blue cheese this one is much more in\nthe Stilton territory so it doesn't have the bitterness and the saltiness that's\nstill tanana's it's not a hard crumbly cheese like Stilton but it does have a\nlot of that power that you get with the Stilton so yes I think in a blind\ntasting these are brave words now I think in a bright blind tasting you\nprobably be able to tell which of these you had based on that on the notes\nthey're just another little piece of this one this one he turn up and someone takes on\nhow to lead you further through the Forester there are mushrooms growing and\nthe birds are singing and very lovely very very nice I like this one very much\nthis one this one's someone smashing your front\ndoor and I'm taking you away the helicopter two quite different things\nboth absolutely fabulous so thank you so much for watching if you've got any\nquestions about this I will do my best to answer them absolutely glorious\ncheese's both of them I love gorgonzola it's so versatile you\ncan put it in salads you can put it on pizza it's great with risotto you can\njust eat it as it is I can't like to do it's beautiful with the drop of wine or\nyou could have it just you know on a cracker eat it straight there's so many\nthings you could do with with gorgonzola a really really beautiful cheese Thank\nYou

welcome to the grow hemp series today I'll be showing you my first outdoor grow within automatic ruderalis plant from seed to harvest while also going over how to set up your first outdoor grow so let's start first with the supplies because growing outdoors has so many variables I'll be covering the essentials separately from the optional equipment so you can get a better idea of what you'll need for your situation to start with everyone will need a seed and grow supplies which is basically a pot soil and fertilizer from there you'll have the utility cost of just water which is practically free but assuming you'll need a pH balance it will say that's another 10 dollars and that's it for the essentials for any other equipment needed it really depends on your environment well list the comment items here along with why they could be needed then go over the extra items that I needed for my first grow so although growing outdoors means that there is potentially almost no setup costs the downside is that you can't choose what your outdoor environment is like this means that anything that is not optimal for growing you're gonna have to get equipment to change it or just accept that the plant will not grow as well because of it if at all the good thing is that we can survive in a wide range of harsh environments but for better control common outdoor equipment includes a greenhouse which can enclose the grow to help regulate the environment humidifiers and dehumidifiers to help control the humidity Shade fans heaters and air cooling options to help control the temperature organic pest control solutions and pesticides to deal with plant destroying bugs and then additional lighting to increase the daylight hours artificially for my first grow setup I started with the greenhouse not really to regulate the environment but because I wanted to film the plant to keep a video log of my grow process and having an enclosed was the easiest way to do so also because of the greenhouse there would be no wind going through the grow space so I had to get a fan to simulate air movement which makes the Kempe dock stronger and helps prevent certain bugs and mildew from attacking the plant the final thing I got was pesticides near the end of the grow which I'll explain in more details why during the time lapse total that comes out to be three hundred and sixty dollars although most of that is because of the greenhouse which wasn't necessary for the grow so first things first I needed two things to start growing my first plant a seed and a home for the seed for the seed I went with an automatic variety this is because I was starting this grow at the beginning of the year with about twelve hours of sunlight a day so a normal seed wouldn't have worked unless I wanted to install lights in the greenhouse which I didn't want to do for my first grow now for the grow medium I just went with regular potting soil from local big-box store and then mixed it with a third of perlite I set it all in a five-gallon fabric pot put it in the middle of greenhouse and and that's it for the greenhouse I went with something solid as opposed to just a plastic film because I wanted to be able to hold the camera on the roof and in the future possibly a grow light now while I don't think the plants would have grown any differently outside of the greenhouse because the weather was very good throughout the entire grow I do think that if you have the budget for one it's worth investing in even just the basic plastic one is better than nothing because they give you a bit of control over an otherwise uncontrollable environment now all that was left to do was to water the plant every couple days with tap water when the swell fell dry down - the first inch of the soil after the third week when the plant changed from a seedling to the vegetative stage I started to add agro fertilizer to the water which contained equal parts phosphorus and potassium and slightly more nitrogen generally all grow fertilizers will already have the correct mix of these main nutrients so you just need to mix it in with your water when feeding the plant I started with 50% of the recommended dosage every other feeding and after week 5 I kept the 50% dosage but added every time I watered the plants also by week 3 when the plant was stable I added a small fan to blow on the plant this isn't necessary if you're not using a greenhouse since the greenhouse was preventing the breeze from hitting the plant so I needed to recreate it and viola 8th week when the plant was growing too tall I switched to an oscillating fan now as we watched a plant slowly go through his vegetative stage I'll go through my growth supplies and why I chose them I went with soil because it's a simplest grow medium to work with and when buying soil there are three types to choose from a normal soil with no fertilizer included which is what I'm using a soil with synthetic fertilizers added and composted soil or swell that has organic fertilizers and microorganisms included composted soil is not common and generally found only at nurseries and gardening stores but if you have access to them or can make your own they're the easiest to grow with because they have the microorganisms in the compost they're able produce all the nutrients a plant needs which means that all you need to feed the plant is water now slow as synthetic fertilizers are the ones you want to avoid these are the ones that always say something along the lines of two months three months six months of feet included the reason for this is because synthetic fertilizers will always absorb into the roots and typically contain a large amount of 9 jujin which is great for the plant when it's growing but could be toxic to the plant when she starts to flower so to be safe stick with the composted soil or soils without anything added to it and if you have to use as well with synthetic fertilizers built in when the plant starts to flower be sure to flush it down with water to try and wash away the excess nutrients I also included perlite with the soil which is a lightweight rock like material as well as utilize a fabric pot versus clay or plastic because of both help with getting air to live roots and keeping the soil from getting too soggy this is huge for new growers like me because there are a ton of issues that can come from over watering from an increase in bugs mold root rot to the plants straight up dying from the lack of oxygen weed is very resilient to dry conditions and can bounce back easily from under watering so the perlite and fabric pot were used as a buffer for the other extreme of over watering and that's about it until the plant started to flower I checked out a plant every other day or so watered when needed and once a plant started to flower I change the nutrients from a grow fertilizer to a bloom fertilizer the main difference in the two fertilizers is that the nitrogen levels went down and the potassium levels went up now the trichomes has started to appear cloudy at this point I also noticed that some of the family started showing tiny white marks I cut off on the fan leaves and saw that this was caused by a spider mite now this being my first grow I wasn't scared of most pests but spider mites were the one I feared based on the stories I've read so I got in organic pest control to mist over the plants every other day and decided to harvest a little bit earlier than planned with him depending on how you're going to process the plan you can choose to harvest it in multiple ways here I'll be doing the most traditional harvesting method of drying and curing the buds and to start this off I'll be trimming off all the large van leaves before cutting down each individual stem [Music] now I'm just giving the stems a light trim to remove any excess leaves from the buds and unless you're planning on smoking the hemp which is one of the ways to intake the CBD content in the buds the step isn't necessary as all the other forms of extracting the CBD from the buds will want the whole buds in town now I'm just hanging up to individual stems to dry for a weekend [Music] and then finally facing them in glass mason jars for long-term storage and to ensure that the buds have dried evenly I'm using a hygrometer in the jar to check that the buds are under 62 percent relative humidity and that's it for more weekly videos guides and lists of where to get all the supplies that I've used check out hemp in a pot calm you [Music]",

really am get a good idea of sort of how much is in it but I'll try to do another one when they're out of the tent and you can get a better idea of how much bugs actually all the flops there's so much leaf inches stems I should have really cut back but I do like this or let mine go a bit wild and do their own thing I mean the way talked about a month into fetch through four weeks individual so [Music] see how she could have done a bit more pruning a bit a bit more ruthless I think but this one here you can see us try and get a better picture but this is a clone of the blue mystic it's actually a clone of this one here on the right then this one here has grown significantly different to the one on the left but on the left has got all these huge ball shaped buzz [Music] hurry up please but the one on the left is growing more smaller and skinnier buds on is pronounced the most sort of long rather than bulbous but it is that's about three weeks into flower and I'm just hand hand watering this one at the Pirates pouring the water in the tray there I'll rigged up to the auto pot when these two are out tonight [Music] but I've also got to Lady Bird 9th 1974 vegging which will go in here once there was there ready or once they show sex female obviously and yeah the grow will continue - am another short video of the yield either late tonight or we're sometime tomorrow yeah I reckon driveway probably in between four and six anyway take you guys soon", "_O3Z5LWqKAY": "so YouTube thought up another video where I'm at basically we've got blue mystic flown there and the bag it is new both great summer horrible lines that's nasty yeah that's the blue mystic clone I took or weeks and weeks ago - lady burn 1974's here and here what we can't seem to whelks they're absolutely taken over half the ten pretty much all on the also pop system since a pro's nearly run dry and that valve will allow let move all three months and the waters gone so got to there as one Cordy sit samosas absolutely packed in it but yes looking nice it sounds very very peppery this one myself fresh cracked black pepper or pepper started off really slow in veg and just exploded when I started flowering it having grown autos for quite a while now I was expecting a sort of rapid growth but obviously an that wasn't the case but over here both can see this lanky one in that's the Easy Rider that's also on a mousou pot setup that was put in about three weeks ago this has probably got about another four to five weeks left that's doing all right and that's only on 12 hours it's got a fitting the rest of the other three in here so you know what with electric costs and that I thought saw that let's just try it on twelve hours instead of eighteen or 60 and see how she does and she's putting out really nicely what's the nice frosty guards already these gaps between the Internode's to fill up hopefully that should be one nice fat main color there is some nice side branches sorry about the lack of access to this video but everything's crammed in it like it's in a sardine so apologies for that what done here is a quick I've knocked up her a 5 liter bucket and put a little where top at grommet on it so maybe Bay and it's a six mil in line sorry six mil irrigation pipe and that goes down into the EZ air Easyrider trade and the main tank this big one here yesterday the big reservoir that leads to the toe here so the big tank speaking there - lady burns and the single little five little bucket is feeding these you either no point in having a big tank for just a single plant and yeah the one at the back the blue mystic climb is just sat in a try but I've taken the valve out because started flushing it lost last week so tomorrow will be the chop day for that one that's been a week on flush with some camouflage flushed it through with about 15 to 20 liters got remember now Walter mix with camouflage and then just been feeding their water weeks new addition carbon air filter because yeah had a bit of a scare the other day someone knocked around and answered we answered the door and they mentioned about the stink so I did actually have this lying around but hooked up so that got installed a few days ago and my god does it work works really really well I mean completely eliminates the smell and when you smell that the air coming out of there I some claim you can't even smell him over anything slightly dubious so there we go 400 watt light oscillating fan as a dehumidifier in there just see that there meditate nice level but yeah I'll do another video of these when they're out the temp and I've got a chance you can see sizes of each plant because it just looks like a bit of a jungle with the Romans but yeah there we go blue mystic at the back there - lady burn - and fours and an Easy Rider all crammed into a great n with three older boss anyway I'll be doing another video fairly soon I'll take it all the parts out the tent and film individually so you get better right there anyway let's get going and stay tuned", "NwzskTWMPAw": "so I've got quite a few food fears by food fear I think means something right it's like I don't drink I'm gonna rush like that and allergies and stuff I'm not suggesting you eat food that you're allergic to please don't do that but everyone's got a food fear right people like Gregory there will be tweeted me and said that he hates bananas and porridge together I'm not bananas apart open your mind when I first started my virgin kitchen I hate it tomatoes now I love them so this little list of videos I'm doing is about trying to overcome some of my top food fears to see if I can sort of just go yeah I like it or just completely put it to the Graveyard and never try it again the rules are very simple my food fear goes on the plate right here and a glass of water is available just to keep me sane if that's okay with you I'm not gonna chuck it in a big pot or a party to make it part of a meal my food fear I'm gonna take it one on one like a cowboy shootout baby so let's get started my first beer is blue Stilton cheese oh my gosh it's quite an interesting one for me really because I hate cheese with a passion genuinely unless it's melted if it's on a pizza like mozzarella all right if it's will melt it didn't like breaking down I can deal with it but a hard block like this is intimidating you mean terminating me so right now I haven't really got our problem with it it's you know it's in this packaging just like being on the supermarket shelf [ __ ] when I'm walking down the aisle with my trolley I can be like yeah keep that side and it's like smooth like a baby's bum in there it's all it's all tucked away now it's time to get outta pad.you right so just taking that wrapper off that smell is hit me already do this let's bring it in for a smell how I set Oh Oh smells like socks I used to wear after playing a football match absolutely oh my gosh why would you want to eat nuts oh gosh doesn't even feel like cheese let's go all the blue bits in it it's like that's not cheap cheese isn't supposed to be blue to me tea should be like nice and melted on Pizza it's not right I think the cheese is getting scared too is getting all right sweaty and clammy and like nervous - you're feeling my pain and it's got like this big sort of scaly back there it's like a t-rex like a t-rex dinosaur I've got cheese nice but I'm gonna cut oh my gosh this bit will do I'm gonna try and eat that and that section can go like and get completely sterilized and chemically treated somewhere oh my gosh I do not want to be near this place right now right so here we go then there's a few crumbs down there and I'm gonna go anywhere near these this is have a bite ah ah oh my gosh guys got noise alright I tastes like fire this data I I know that was only my first bite and I said it smelled like socks but it actually tastes like them too but that's I think some of you probably like what is he on about that tastes amazing but for me oh my gosh I don't know what that was I think that might be one of the greeny blue bit things I discussed it that was oh my gosh oh I get really emotional over it all that it's like really ah there is no other way to describe this but I'm literally eating a plate of socks right now socks that I've been on the like the longest marathon run and football mats and rugby match will covered in mud and just smellin and lettuce like there you go sir have a plate of socks and thank you very much I'll put it on my my cracker and eat it know about one last try and I'm going to try and do they let the t-rex dinosaur ruff bit on the edge and just see if that can do anything for me this how I go no no aah let's hear expert I don't know if that's the strongest part of cheese but that tastes like like like a super super stock like a giant one oh my gosh that's horrible I saw the text to him like my plasticine oh I just don't like here [Music] I'm trying workout first a blue bit that's the worst bit don't Oh description of this cheese is strong and creamy yeah it's that really strong but creamier ah you know I kind of get that vibe but if it's only if you like your poor cream all over it like a field and then just eat it all up including the grass than the mud that is the element of cream in there just imagine having this on your first date and you're like oh you'll finish your kiss to see your neck and your give them kiss and they smell a socks not good so let's find out if this fear is a fat food or food fail sorry blue cheese but you're a food felt for me so yeah this one is a food fail and my fingers they still smell of it so I only don't have three showers if you want to take this off my hand you are more than welcome to I was sent I'll pay you to take off my hands people like Selina rag the said hey you're going to love it I didn't", "Zfrwls0H2AE": "what up everybody far far more 420 here and as you

subscribe", "RyiVx3C5l4A": "(upbeat music) - Hey munchies, welcome to\nthe channel if you're new or if you're not I'm\nAlyssia and I'm stoked you're here either way. I have surprisingly\nhad a lot of people say can you do a video that\nshows healthy convenience store snacks, like gas stations snacks. I don't know why I'm surprised by this but I kind of thought gas stations and convenience stores\nhave a lot of options. So, I was confused about why\npeople really wanted this video and I started to think about it. I have some thoughts I'm gonna share. But my first thing I would\nadvise when asking yourself this question or asking anyone\nthis question, because you're on the hunt for healthy,\nconvenience source snacks is, why? So really knowing what is your goal and why are you gonna\nthe convenience store, is it because you're on the road? Are you just, you know, driving\nhome from school or what? So if you're on the road,\nwhich is usually when I go to a convenience store or gas station, that was kind of my\napproach to this video, is it because you're on Whole30\nand paleo that it's hard? Is it that you're trying to be healthy? Is it because you're\nafraid of eating bad foods? Are you experiencing some guilt or or are you judging yourself? You know, all of these kinds\nof change the intention behind why you want healthy\nconvenience store snacks and that intention will\nimpact your experience. So if this is a matter of you wanting healthy convenience store snacks\nbecause you're on the road, and any of those other things\nI just listed are true. My next question would be how frequently are you really on the road? Because if this is something\nlike for me, I don't, especially in coronavirus\ntimes, I don't travel a lot. There's not that many\nopportunities that I have to go into a convenience store and find a snack. So when I do, I kind of\nknow it's not forever. And do I really need to get\nso worked up over what it is. Again if I was doing Whole30\nor something, then yeah it would make sense, but you\nsee how this intention matters. So the truth is, it's\nactually not hard at all to find something healthy\nat a convenience store. And if you start with the fridge, that's gonna be your best bet for fresh, you know, regarding healthy. So whole fruit bananas, oranges, apples, you're almost always gonna find those. And in the actual refrigerator section they usually have like\nchopped, fresh fruit. I went to a 7-Eleven for this video and all the snacks I'm\ngonna show you today are from a 7-Eleven, but they\nhad, you know, chopped fruit that was mixed like the box I got here but they also had melons and grapes. They had some chopped salads and you know, a lot of times you can\nalso find like celery with peanut butter or boiled eggs. My store didn't have those but those are things\nyou can typically find in the refrigerator at a gas station. Uh cheese, I also found cheese and you know, prosciutto sticks and baby bells and that kind of stuff. That could be a great source of protein especially if you're\non the road and looking for something that will keep\nyou satisfied for longer. Now, here's what I realized\nas I started to contemplate why do people really want this video? So what's hard walking\ninto a convenience store is not finding something\nhealthy, it's deciding not to get something\nunhealthy, because we walk in and we're exposed to like a\nheaven of processed foods. It's just like so much stimulus. And I just want to eat\nall of these things. And why would I want to\npick up an apple when they have Doritos, you know,\nand all the good stuff. So I think the challenge\nis really mental, right? This is mind over munch. It keeps showing up every day. The challenge is walking\ninto the gas station and choosing something healthy. This is a valid concern and\nshould still be addressed. So if you feel like\nyou're forcing yourself to choose something that you don't want, it might be worth it to\njust pick the thing you want and give yourself permission to eat it. I did an entire video about the power of permission\nwith food last year and I'll link that below\nif that calls to you. If I go to a gas station and I need and I want or need to get a snack I'll first check in with my inner wisdom. If you don't know what\ninner wisdom is check out that video first so you\nknow what I'm talking about but essentially asking in,\ntuning in how hungry am I? Am I hungry? Am I just bored? You know, a lot of times\non road trips, I am bored. It's actually okay to\neat when you're bored and it's okay to eat junk\nfood because you feel like it. The question is what\nresonates with your body and heart and mind in\nthis moment considering the big picture of any health efforts you may be making or setting\nintentions around, right? So if you're like, well right now I'm doing Whole30 specifically to learn about what resonates with my body. Then yeah, it serves you\nto get really intentional. But if you're just like, ah I feel so guilty if I eat that food and it's coming from that\nplace of judgment, I would say take a step back and think\nabout why this matters to you. So after I check in with my inner wisdom then I can work out to the outer wisdom which is like the nutrition knowledge. So when it comes to outer\nwisdom, I personally will look more at ingredients\nof a snack these days in my life than I will\nthe macro nutrients. So the main thing I'll look\nat on the label is added sugar because added sugar provides\nno nutrition at all. Again, that doesn't mean that\nyou shouldn't or can't eat it. It's just, if I'm trying to\nmake a very intentional choice considering outer wisdom,\nI would personally look at added sugar, for instance,\nover calories or even fat. So throughout this video I'm gonna go through these snacks. The intention was choosing cleaner items. And by clean, I am defining\nclean as less processed, not good. This is not about, you\nknow, morality in food. I like the word clean because\nit just is a quick way to nod to being less processed. If you don't like the word you can replace it with whatever you like. I'm not saying, you know these foods are good in\nthese foods are bad, okay? So what else is there to eat\nat a convenience store besides fruit and cheese if you're\ntrying to make a healthy choice. Also from the fridge section,\nthese Sabra Snackers, okay? I love this. They're crunchy salty, satisfying. You get the protein from the hummus and you kind of get the\nprocessed food from the pretzel. So it's kind of like\nthe best of both worlds but you get a little bit\nof nutrition out of it. Oka, these kind of refrigerated smoothies, this is Mighty Mango Naked. This one, I just pretty much\nlooked in the refrigerator and this was the one\nthat had no added sugar. It does have, you know,\n68 grams of carbohydrates, 57 grams of sugar, but\nit's not added sugar. That being said it is a lot of fruit. I've joked about this\non the channel before when I did a video about\njuices and this has one and a quarter mangoes,\none and three quarters apples a half an orange, a\nthird of a banana, right? Like, would you eat\nthat much fruit at once? Probably not. That being said, it's\nstill a cleaner choice. So you do you. Okay, Pickled Bites. Yum, I've never seen these before. I was actually surprised how\nmuch healthy stuff they had at this 7-Eleven, but it's\nliterally just pickles. I think they're deal flavored\npickles in a bag, like that's awesome. Alright, so these were some\nlike fruit snacks that did not have added sugar into them. They were just the fruit. So these crispy apple chips, the only ingredient is apples, right? I might not want an apple on the road but if I want a crunchy, you\nknow, processed-like snack then here you go. Maybe that will satisfy you, maybe not. These Orchard Blend, Sweet Persimmon, Tart Apple and Tangy Peach dried chews. The only ingredients are\npeaches, apples, and persimmons. You can't get any\ncleaner than that really. So, and then this is apples fruit squeeze. It's not called apple sauce because actually it's\nnot just apples pureed, this is apple juice concentrate. So that is gonna have\na little bit more sugar but it's not added. So another great gas\nstation food is popcorn. So this is just, you know,\nregular sea salt popcorn. The only ingredient, popcorn,\nsunflower oil and sea salt. I don't know if this\none is air fried or not but you could always look for air fried if you're looking for lower and fat this one's probably not because\nthere's nine grams of fat. And then these Popcorner chips, only ingredients are yellow,\ncorn, sunflower oil and salt. And the White Cheddar Smartfood. I love this stuff so much. It's actually not as bad\nfor you as you might think. And I talked about this in\nmy healthy processed foods video or low, you know,\nI did a video last year about processed foods that\nhave minimal ingredients. So if that's what you're looking for, when you're looking at,\nyou know, gas station foods watch that video because\nI go through a lot of surprising processed\nfoods that have just a couple of ingredients. And this one I compare\nspecifically to, they have like, what is it a Smartfood 100 where it's like a hundred calorie Smartfood\npop compared to this one. And that one has way more ingredients. And it's actually not that\nmuch lower in calories. It's like nominal when you weigh it out. And I actually show you this side by side. While talking, you know, super processed, these are other ones that\nI've mentioned in the healthy processed or low\ningredient processed foods video. Pork rinds, okay? Pork rinds are almost always just gonna be fried pork skins and salt, right? Or, you know oil if they're fried. I don't personally love\nthe taste of pork rinds, but a lot of people do and\nit's actually a cleaner food. Chips, now Baked Lays\ndo have more ingredients but they have less fat\nbecause they're baked. These Lays only have\npotatoes, oil and salt. That's three ingredients. It could be worse, right? So like you have to decide\nwhat's worth it to you. And again, why are you, why\nare you getting this snack? Are you really just like wanting a crunchy delicious thing on the\nroad then why are you gonna force yourself\nto get the apple chips, when are these really\ndoing that much damage? I don't know. I would argue no. I would argue personally now\nmy feeling is the stress. I used to get so stressed\nout about this stuff. The stress that I would\nput my body and mind under, choosing something I didn't want because I was trying to be healthy, actually physiologically that\nstress did my body more damage than just eating the chips. That's me personally, okay? And then pretzels, pretzels are always. I love pretzels so much, you\nknow, it's a could be worse it's could be worse kind of food. Like they don't have too many ingredients. Yeah, it's white flour. It's enriched, but it could be worse. Nuts and seeds are another\ngreat choice that you can find at almost any convenience store. And if you are trying to be\npaleo or Whole30 or whatever, this is probably where you\nshould head to be safe. Watch out though,\nespecially if you're doing a strict elimination\ndiet like the Whole30. You can't eat peanuts for\ninstance, there are legumes, but most nuts are, a lot of\nnuts are fried in or roasted in peanut oil, so you have to check. And sometimes it'll say\nlike canola or peanut oil and you don't know which so\nit's not technically compliance. That gets really tricky. But for the most part,\nyou know, nuts are nuts. What I will say about the\nnut situation is if you go in shell or raw, it's\ngonna be your cleanest bet. Same goes for sunflower\nseeds in the shell. You can't get any cleaner than that. When it starts to come to flavoring, okay? So like these peanuts are salt and lime. The ingredients list gets longer. There's sugar and corn syrup,\nsolids and dextrose, right? And maltodextrin, whatever. There's more stuff in it\nis it the end of the world? If there is some stuff in your\npeanuts and you like them, lime flavored, that's up to you. Like me, I hate raw almonds. I will never eat a raw almond. It just tastes disgusting to me. These Wasabi Bold Almonds, I love these. They're so freaking good. They're not clean. They're not clean at\nall, but they're tasty. And really, you know, it's, I mean, they're not clean but they've\ngot one gram of added sugar. To have sugar is the main\nthing you're looking out for. You can still have a\ndelicious, crunchy snack where you know you're getting some nutrition. Uuhm these Love Corn. I don't know this brand,\nI've never had it before but any kind of like roasted\ncorn snack like this, the only ingredients are\nusually corn and oil and salt. This one also has habanero chili. One other thing I wanted\nto bring attention to was trail mixes, because\nthis is something else you can find at a gas station. And usually this is what trail, I guess trail mixes are technically\nlike for the trail, right? Like you go on a hike, you go on a trail and you've got this like mix\nthat'll keep you satisfied. Well, you know, on a car trip\nis sort of the same thing. If you don't have access\nto a food for a while, then a trail mix should\nkeep you satisfied. Here's the thing, you\nprobably already know this if you're watching this\nchannel, most trail mixes especially if they have\ndried fruit in them they have a lot of added sugar. This is so sneaky. Look at these two packages, which one looks healthier to you? Right, yeah, I mean, you\ndecide for yourself, but yeah this one looks like the branding\nmakes it look healthier. Like look at all these\nhealth claims, protein no artificial colors or\nflavors, no preservatives low sodium, blah, blah, blah. But then you look at the\nadded sugar of each of these. So this one just looks like\na regular old thing of, you know, nut and fruit mix. This one has one gram of added sugar and this one has eight. It's from the cranberries. Usually cranberries are\ngonna have added sugar. This one only has one gram\nof added sugar though. So I would actually pick this one and the ingredients are\njust as clean, right? So you have to read the label and don't go based on\nthe sneaky marketing. That being said maybe you\nwant really sweet cranberries in your trail mix, you know. Eating at a gas station is not forever. At least if you're going\non a road trip, I mean you're not gonna die from\neating some added sugar on your cranberries,\nor even from, you know picking the honey bun or the powdered sugar\ndonuts that I like to eat at a gas station, right? Like maybe when you're on a road trip this is the one time you get\nto indulge in eating some of those, you know, nostalgic\ngas station favorites, that you don't let\nyourself have very often or that you don't have the\nopportunity to have very often. So for me, giving myself permission in those contexts to say, no this is when I really want to\nhave the powdered sugar donuts and enjoy them fully. That's what works for me. The next go-to at a gas station or convenience store would be\nlike protein or meat snacks. So Jerkys is what a lot of people go for for a healthy snack. To be honest, the 7-Eleven I was at had no clean Jerkys at all. There are clean Jerkys now. Like it used to be you couldn't find a jerky without added sugar. You can find it now,\nbut not at my 7-Eleven. So these, are both, you know,\none has seven grams of sugar. The second ingredient is sugar. The Turkey Jerky has\nonly four grams of sugar but the second ingredient or maybe it's third\ningredient is still sugar. The Turkey Jerky has a really long a much longer ingredients list. So by the kind of arbitrary\nrule I gave you at the beginning of the video where I said, I\ngo by ingredients, you know and I look at sugar, whatever, I'm kind of breaking that rule because I would actually\npick this one over this. Why would I pick it? I like the way it tastes. I actually prefer the taste and texture of Turkey jerky, right? So this is the point you guys, there are no rules and any rule,\nhard and fast rules you set around food are only\ngonna make you miserable. They only made me miserable. I should speak from my\nexperience, huh, okay. These rules made me miserable and letting go of the rules\nthat like, I can only eat it if there's this much sugar\nor not, and this can't exist on the label or it has to\nbe this many, whatever. All that stuff drove me nuts. At the end of the day,\nit's one snack, okay? It's one snack on one car\ntrip, pick the one you want. This beef steak thing,\nthis looks so disgusting. I've never eaten one of these, but I had to get it\nbecause it was an option. So it's pretty much just\nas bad as the jerky. I mean, not as bad, it\nhas two grams of sugar but has a bunch of, Oh, it has MSG in it. Ooh, it's probably good. This Ahi Tuna Jerky Strip. I've never seen this or tried it before but I was impressed. It doesn't have any added sugar. The ingredients are\npretty clean and you know, it's a good option for a\nlow, moderately low calorie. It's a hundred calories,\nhigh protein, clean snack. You can also buy tuna at the gas station. Who knew 7-Eleven sold\nlike regular chunk tuna. Now this is not, I would\nsay this is probably not ideal to like get in\nyour car and eat this. Unless you have a, a can\nopener in the middle console, then it's not gonna be\nfeasible or easy to eat. But this little Wild Tuna\nMeal Kit, 7-Select brand which I think that's\n7-Eleven brand, right? It's, you know, pretty clean. I mean, it's got crackers. So, you know, if there's\nenriched flour in there, but this could be a good way to\nget a satisfying protein snack. They also of course have a whole\nlike aisle of protein bars. I haven't eaten protein\nbars in a couple of years but I was like, oh my gosh, there are so many protein\nbars now, most of them, I wouldn't, I just wouldn't eat them because I don't like the way they taste. Protein bars don't fill me up. But I wanted to at least\npick one up for the sake of the video, because of\ncourse it's an option, right? And depending on your health\ngoals and your food freedom it might be the right choice for you. I grabbed this. I don't actually like the way these tastes but they had the best,\nthe best ingredients. You know, it's like six\ningredients and it's pretty clean. Personally, I would\nprobably eat the baby bell or the cheese stick which\nhe gives me, two of these would give me as much protein in this. And it tastes way better. The other thing about protein bars, I said that they don't fill me up. They don't fill me up\nphysically, but also mentally. So a lot of times I eat them and I still feel like\nI haven't eaten food. So if I'm really hungry I wanna\neat something where my mind and body both know, okay, I ate. And if I'm wanting to eat a processed food and I'm just like, oh,\nthe protein bar kind of like satisfies the process, you\nknow, food itch or whatever. It doesn't for me anymore. It used to, now I want the real deal. I want, you know, the donuts\nor the chips or whatever. So I couldn't go into a gas station without buying a candy bar, right? So I have a Twix bar here and\nI also have this healthier Hu, Hu, Hu Get Back To Human Chocolate. So it's dark chocolate. I don't like dark chocolate. It's also organic, 70%\ncacao, vegan, paleo. I'm the wrong person to ask. I'm not a chocolate person. I like Twix bars, I like snicker bars, but not because I like chocolates 'cause of all the other good stuff in it. So, this would bring me no joy. Would it bring you joy? Maybe if you're someone\nwho likes dark chocolate, I would rather have the Twix bar. So again, intention here matters. If your intention is\ntrying to satisfy a deep desire to have a Snickers bar, right? This is probably not gonna do it. And this is why a lot of times\nwe can eat these substitutes and then still feel hungry or unsatisfied mentally and physically. But if you're just like, no,\nI really like dark chocolate and I really want a square\nof it to just, you know, have a little sweet after\nmy lunch or whatever then maybe it satisfies you. The only way to know is to\ntune into your inner wisdom. No one outside can tell you. Okay and the last snack is\nnot one I would recommend for if you want to eat\nhealthy at a convenience store but I saw them and I\ncouldn't not buy them. So I figured I'd buy it and taste it. These are pop tart bites. I couldn't resist. So there's 40 grams of sugar\nand 41 grams of added sugar. Oh my gosh, look so cute. Smell your food before you\neat it it'll taste better. There's your mindfulness tip. Oh my God, hmm. It tastes exactly like\nyou think it would taste. It's perfect, oh my gosh, that's so good. It's like a miniature\nPop-Tart that's almost better because there's a better\nratio of like icing, icing to cookie or pastry\nor whatever mixture than on a regular side Pop-Tart. Oh, these are so good. Not recommended if you're\ntrying to eat healthy at a convenience store, but\nI went to a convenience. I went to 7-Eleven and I saw them and I could not get them, so. So, that is the spread. I literally walked into a 7-Eleven. I was like, how many\nhealthy items can I get? This is what I found. I hope that it, you know,\nsupports your journey in some way. The goal was not for me to tell you these are the snacks to\nget, it was to help you really start to investigate\nwithin yourself. What are my intentions here, right? Like why does this matter to me? Just my own experience. I spent so much time, so many\nyears causing myself stress and distress around food and health and trying to make the right choice and then choosing what\nI didn't actually want because I thought I\nwas doing my body right and I was actually causing\nnot just like mental stress, but physiological stress\nin my body, dysregulation. I couldn't lose weight no\nmatter how many calories I ate because of that stress. So this is my mission here is\nto help you not stress so much about food and health, because so much of what we thought mattered\nreally doesn't matter that much, if our stress isn't under control.

state or you have a medical marijuana card like I don't know leave my personal information yo sup guys Ronnie ray back at juice so I got another court review for you guys in this video guys probably already seen my last couple I got a bunch of these brands to let cards this video my last one I actually have Northern Lights I'm actually really excited to try this up I had another nice part like not too long ago and it was fires but it was by different brands I'm excited to try this brand slide because I know their course are [ __ ] fired so I already went over the package and that detailing like almost every other [ __ ] video I did a review on so if you want to see the packaging in more detail you can go check out one of those videos but um yeah I'll speed through it a little bit yeah but I'll speed do it real quick for you guys so the front of it just says select elite premium babes and then the strain the test results Hybrid decided Arizona Department of Health warning and then that gives you uh yes it looks that's really cool I mean I kind of like that a lot this suggestion suggested serving but I'm already kind of high if you guys can already kind of hide you can't oh and I got to go to work real soon I'm just trying to speed through this so uh I'm gonna be pretty late at work I guess lucky so um that's pretty cool they have a suggestion sir even though I like that should a lot and besides for that I'm gonna just has the test results on the bottom you guys can see that yeah and then um I like this part a lot too I think everyone will I said no added chemicals and all that good [ __ ] you know I mean you know you'll want to be smoking under that and then my favorite part about this um well the back not the price point [ __ ] seventy bucks but that right there the packaging on these carts like five out of five and like all the details I gave you like so you guys didn't read that it says uh obviously indica Northern Lights menaces a description of a house balsam apace and how it's supposed to make you feel so it's supposed to taste earth it's supposed to taste earthy sweet in like pine and I noticed one thing a lot of these cards just like they say sweet that's not really a sweet I don't know it's like an artificial sweetener that sounds down but there's no way no other way to describe it like you think a sweet I was sure it's not like that taste it's like a weird taste I don't know um yeah so what do look a little taste test er a taste and see if they're like description of it like matches up and it gives you a description huh also says a description of how it's supposed to make you feel like I said so I supposed to make you feel relaxed happy and sleepy alright now what I need before I go to work especially when I'm [ __ ] high already but [ __ ] it 92 percent THC that's [ __ ] pony um so like I said you get 250 hits out of this one gram card if you hit for like three seconds or whatever they say and each each three second hit is supposed to be like almost three point seven milligrams of THC you guys can see right there so I just found out little like detail they give you pretty interesting it cool like not really yet like I don't think any other card companies really do like not I mean tell you how much how much THC you getting for hits you can like another if you need to like get your correct dosage for that I'm saying and then obviously no CBD so there's no CBD per serving and I just noticed this is pretty sick so it was tested on 5:19 2019 guessing uh so June ninth right no that was like I don't know no so May 9th this was tested I'm guessing they make the distillate first before they make the cards then it says product made 5:20 in 2019 so it's pretty fresh what is that like a two week old card did we go card always from like the daytime according this I don't know when you guys are watching this at easing [ __ ] but yeah so it's pretty fresh card like two three weeks old and it's a tested by c4 Laboratories I think I said that but besides for that let's just hop into this so you just pull this little tab right here a little bit you just pull that tab a little bit and the packaging is [ __ ] dope the way you're greeted I don't feel like we do not really quite a few guys so it says I'm select elite elevate your medical marijuana enjoyment of a higher level with our luxurious trip line if you through pain and use cartridges this top-shelf cartridge packs a powerful punch with our highest level of active in their medical marijuana THC so I was talking to open it I think this is a website where I don't know who we want website that you'll use on a lot of these have a grunt like a ran the website right there you know what I mean but there's some websites you can go check it out if you want there's the card right off the bat that she looks [ __ ] fire you guys can see yeah so let's take it out take a look okay look I'm like I love the color of these card it's like I mean some of the cards thing obviously the color depends on the strain you use and a whole bunch of other [ __ ] yeah I mean but this color this cart is [ __ ] like straight-up gold and look at that [ __ ] consistency that's true that [ __ ] is not moving oh that [ __ ] just books fire look at that [ __ ] the color that like you could like read my beneath it expires Northern Lights what is it 92 percent THC that [ __ ] is not even moving at all that's just not moving out all you guys see that alright so let's hop into this I gotta go to work in a minute so first off is a little taste test supposed to taste the berry tea sweet and like pine-sol let's see if it tastes like sweet and pine so if you guys are smoking along hope you guys are smoking something dank and yeah besides for that let's just not go into this so cheer isn't this good I second this one's a little bit different I can actually taste this well it's not like it like I said it's not like a sugary sweet taste it but this one has a different sweet taste and those others it's like all the cars that say sweet they kind of have a similar that sweet taste but this one has a little bit of a different sweet taste you know I mean but I can definitely taste the earthy and pine but it's just hey Scott the thing about that cards is since it says they're so [ __ ] like potent so like 92 percent THC you know what I mean you're just that you're overwhelmed with like a appear disabilities yeah I mean so it's kind of hard they taste us pretty sweet and Pyun taste but you can still taste it like 8% it's 92 percent THC you know what I mean but definitely has a earthy sweet and piney taste definitely feeling relaxed and sleepy I don't want to go to work but [ __ ] it I mean I'm gonna go so happy I'm feeling pretty happy so the taste I'll give it like a four and a half out of five just because they should say that the tasters say earthy sweet pine and THC this lip and then it'll be a five out of five if it said to be a five out of five but it just doesn't say th see this little nut s'what I'm tasting so four and a half out of five but now I'm on the real dough with Hayes [ __ ] fire four and a half out of five though I've had better tasting cards but it's [ __ ] fire definitely taste that earthy sweet and pine it's definitely making me relax like I said definitely maybe definitely feel unhappy and I'm definitely feeling sleepy and I'm definitely throw [ __ ] high F when you got to go to work so [ __ ] and the feeling I'm lit up so the description or the description of how it supposed to make you feel I'll go to four and a half out of five - I know it could be a 505 I'm already very [ __ ] high I was really high before I made this video so spent on it right now but um I don't know maybe it could be a five but yeah I'm just gonna give it a 4.5 out of 5 this parts [ __ ] fire all their parts are fire if you have it if you ever see this like their cards in your head definitely pick them up don't sleep and if they have to deal with like the final one get one free go Stephanie pick one up two up but besides for that discard it's [ __ ] fire like you guys see how it looks how it [ __ ] all they're gonna stay taste wouldn't make any sense [ __ ] looks [ __ ] stupid flame you know I mean let's take one more big hit for you guys and then yes I'll wrap this video up my [ __ ] that one up so maybe alright so let's get it all right that's it I can't get too high before I go to work so you guys like this video no the hi I'm I get the hive fog of the hi actually a 5 out of 5 that's actually a really [ __ ] potent card at the price point I wish it was like about 60 bucks 70 bucks is too [ __ ] expensive I like to buy one get one free deal though but um the overall score for the car I'll go to four and a half out of five so close to a five it just needs to be a little bit cheaper if you guys like this video and want to see more part reviews let me know down below in the comments and tell me what for ends and [ __ ] like that and if you guys want to see you if you want like this [ __ ] the pop the top pop down below in the comments and I'll get this out but yeah overall score for that car it 4.5 out of 5 so close to a fire broke you just needs to be a little bit cheaper but I guess besides for that if you guys like this video um guys like this video and you guys have any like suggestions for me constructive criticism ideas anything you guys want to [ __ ] tell me at all just comment down below you can be a [ __ ] troll I don't care please don't I don't care of it before you know I mean

Today\u00a0\u00a0 we have the widely available\u00a0\nbut no less delicious St Agur. Before we dive into this beautiful French cheese,\u00a0\nthank you all so much for all your views comments\u00a0\u00a0 likes and shares and to all new subs thank you so\u00a0\nmuch for subscribing it makes a real difference\u00a0\u00a0 if you've not done that already then\u00a0\nplease like share comment and subscribe and\u00a0\u00a0 hit the bell to be notified of new videos so\u00a0\nhere we have the beautiful St Agur it's widely\u00a0\u00a0 available in pretty much every supermarket\u00a0\nin the uk it's very common you can even get\u00a0\u00a0 it in some of the convenient shops the smaller\u00a0\nstores smaller supermarkets um that doesn't mean\u00a0\u00a0 that it's in any way substandard this is a\u00a0\nbit of a personal favourite i love St Agur\u00a0\u00a0 um so yeah what makes it so special well first of\u00a0\nall you can see it's got this beautiful blue vein\u00a0\u00a0 um that's produced in the same\u00a0\nway as most of the others where\u00a0\u00a0 culture is added then the cheese is spiked\u00a0\nto allow air in but first of all if we go\u00a0\u00a0 back to the the milk this is from the oven\u00a0\nregion where the blue dover same region\u00a0\u00a0 of central France this is produced from milk from\u00a0\nthe Monbiliarde cows which a few of our other\u00a0\u00a0 cheeses have been made from it seems to be a bit\u00a0\nof a favourite bit of a french favourite i think\u00a0\u00a0 this is also a double creme cheese so it has a\u00a0\nbutterfat content of about 60 so it doesn't quite\u00a0\u00a0 make it it doesn't quite make it into our triple\u00a0\ncreme hall of fame but it's still a double creme\u00a0\u00a0 and that makes it extremely delicious certainly\u00a0\nfor my palette um it doesn't have a protected\u00a0\u00a0 designation of origin um but it is nevertheless\u00a0\na magnificent cheese in terms of its texture you can see on here it's quite soft\u00a0\nbut it's just about holding its\u00a0\u00a0 shape i don't think i could hold it like that\u00a0\nfor too long before it gave way it is actually\u00a0\u00a0 moving in my hands there so it's it's\u00a0\nsomewhere in between it's definitely\u00a0\u00a0 it's only not as soft as gorgonzola\u00a0\ndolce um it's not as crumbly as rock four\u00a0\u00a0 so it's somewhere in between it has that lovely\u00a0\ncreamy gooeyness to it ah the smell is beautiful\u00a0\u00a0 sometimes blue cheeses can be a bit strong\u00a0\nor they can smell a bit musty or a bit dry\u00a0\u00a0 or any combination of those this cheese actually\u00a0\nsmells so fresh and creamy still um even though\u00a0\u00a0 you know i haven't tasted it or anything yet it's\u00a0\ni've got a pretty clean palette at the moment\u00a0\u00a0 and i'm really getting that blue scent but without\u00a0\nany of the bitterness so i think the best thing\u00a0\u00a0 to do is probably going to be to dive in and\u00a0\ntry it so i'm actually going to cut it in half\u00a0\u00a0 this way so i can take a nice wedge out of the\u00a0\nmiddle there look at that absolutely exquisite\u00a0\u00a0 it's actually a little you can see it here there's\u00a0\na little pocket of butter foul something in there\u00a0\u00a0 looks absolutely delicious one other thing\u00a0\nabout this cheese which is slightly unusual\u00a0\u00a0 is it's actually made in an\u00a0\noctagonal container octagonal cheeses which is specifically for slicing so\u00a0\u00a0 you end up with a wedge with a flat back\u00a0\nrather than a wedge with a curve so um now appearance wise this looks much\u00a0\nmore like cream than it does cheese\u00a0\u00a0 this looks very creamy perhaps buttery ah and\u00a0\nit's gorgeous there's so much cream left in it on the nose you imagine that that blue\u00a0\nwould have kind of overpowered it because\u00a0\u00a0 there's quite a lot of the blue vein in here\u00a0\nbut it doesn't blow away all the creaminess it\u00a0\u00a0 really holds on to that it's aged for uh 60 days\u00a0\nand as i said it's produced um in a very similar\u00a0\u00a0 fashion to some of the other blue cheeses the\u00a0\nmould is included then it's spiked for aeration\u00a0\u00a0 so i think oh i'm getting truffles\u00a0\nand mushrooms and and cream and butter oh there's all kinds of goodies going on\u00a0\nthere i've got to dive in i've got to try it hmm sorry um what's so lovely about this is how the flavour\u00a0\ndevelops we get creaminess first and then\u00a0\u00a0 we get all that truffly mushroomy flavour which\u00a0\nmellows out we then get some saltiness and around\u00a0\u00a0 the same time as the saltiness is when that blue\u00a0\nvein starts to really come forward but it's not\u00a0\u00a0 intense it's just perfectly accentuates the others\u00a0\nit balances so beautifully with the creaminess\u00a0\u00a0 it's absolutely exquisite it seems a shame\u00a0\nsometimes to when you have all these gorgeous\u00a0\u00a0 cheeses with heritage and protected designation\u00a0\nof origin this up and the other it seems sometimes\u00a0\u00a0 that you shouldn't buy cheeses that are if you\u00a0\nlike more widely available but this cheese is\u00a0\u00a0 absolutely magnificent it's so difficult i'm going\u00a0\nto have another piece straight away oh also you'll\u00a0\u00a0 see how even the the blue vein is it's really\u00a0\nquite evenly um distributed throughout so hmm it actually actually really tastes of clotted\u00a0\ncream to start with a bit like the village i tried\u00a0\u00a0 it's right up there on the creaminess scale\u00a0\u00a0 except the valance obviously wasn't\u00a0\nblue so this then develops afterwards i still got that mushroominess\u00a0\nbut it's just starting to\u00a0\u00a0 edge towards bitterness as\u00a0\nthe blue vein comes through and there's that saltiness which doesn't come\u00a0\nthrough right away at least on my palette\u00a0\u00a0 i think the cream the initial cream notes\u00a0\nare so so rich and so beautiful that they\u00a0\u00a0 they kind of totally balance out\u00a0\nthe salt and it's only once those\u00a0\u00a0 those flavours start to die down that\u00a0\nyou then start to appreciate the blue let's try another bit there's almost like a a hint of port or something\u00a0\ncoming through as well it's absolutely magnificent\u00a0\u00a0 what a cheese i did say that this cheese was\u00a0\na bit of a favourite and with good reason it's available by the way in a few different\u00a0\nformats so you can get this cheese as\u00a0\u00a0 a big wedge from the cheese counter\u00a0\u00a0 you can get this cheese in a packet where it\u00a0\ncomes as a thin wedge which is what this was\u00a0\u00a0 you can also get it as a dip where it's blended\u00a0\nand i assume it's mixed with some other things to\u00a0\u00a0 make it more dippable but um what a cheese what\u00a0\na cheese it's very difficult to choose between\u00a0\u00a0 for me at least to choose between cheeses but\u00a0\nthis hits so many check boxes it's right up there\u00a0\u00a0 with all my absolute favourites i'm um i'm\u00a0\nwondering if at some point i should do a\u00a0\u00a0 taste off and actually pick a favourite\u00a0\nbut i'm not even sure that's possible so um even the texture is beautiful\u00a0\nas well gorgeous texture it's quite gooey as well um so as i said\u00a0\nit's pasteurised from the Monbiliarde cows\u00a0\u00a0 from Bauzac in the Auvergne region\u00a0\num the same as the Bleu D-Auvergne\u00a0\u00a0 mmm and widely available if you're new to blue\u00a0\ncheese this is an amazing cheese to try because\u00a0\u00a0 it's it gives you all the positives of a blue\u00a0\ncheese without you needing to be a kind of\u00a0\u00a0 hardened blue cheese kind of aficionado\u00a0\nif you like this is really accessible\u00a0\u00a0 you could put this in a soup or something you\u00a0\ncould um add it to uh something like broccoli\u00a0\u00a0 like in place of stilton still broccoli\u00a0\nkind of soup it's absolutely magnificent um\u00a0\u00a0 i i imagine would be gorgeous in like a um\u00a0\na cheese sandwich or grilled cheese sandwich\u00a0\u00a0 cheese on toast kind of thing so i urge you

my name is frida and i'm going to talk about cheeses and blue cheeses well first of all i don't like cheese but if i have to choose 10 cheeses all around the world and 10 blue cheeses all around the world and i will choose for example fileta fileta cheese um because in a page i see that the aroma of this cheese is herbal and it was made from pasteurized pasteurized syrup's milk so that's what i want to prove that she is and because the most for me important thing because he's a friends one so [Music] i think that that's one of the most um interesting cheeses for me um i have two robocall cheese and i want to prove that one because it looks like a masapan in the image it looks like a masapan it it was small so that's interesting for me um that seems nice um because um the presentation is funny for me um because he's from portugal so that's interesting thing for me i have uh exam cheese edam cheese is from holland so that's one of the another cheeses that i want to prove um because of the form that it has so that's interesting for me too i have rockstone cheese and i want to prove that one because it looks like a towel actually it looks like um well like a towel when you're uh like a swimming tower well in the case of blue jesus you have if i have to choose ten one cheeses all around the world because i want to prove it uh well to taste it i will choose for example blue bean cheese that's for countries through the world so there's no one specific country when you're where you can found it so that's interesting for me um because in the image looks uh weird you know like something interesting for me so that's what i want to taste it because it's creamy and salty another one blue chews that i want to prove to taste someday um [Music] i will prove kosher blue that's one is from ireland so that sounds interesting for me um because it's vegetarianism vegetarianian so that sounds good for me interesting is acidic is artisan and in semi-soft so that sounds good um [Music] i love that this one that i that i'm going to tell you this one calls murdered blue well it's gonna be sound it's gonna be sound like a word but the reason that i want to taste this one is because the name of this cheese is funny for me because it calls merida blue so that sounds uh funny for me because i see a tv series called grey's anatomy and the principal character of this tv series called meredith so that sounds funny for me and this one is from australia so [Music] good [Music] i will probe i will", "lhtGmNj6lSU": "i want to share with you something a little bit special this is the prince of french blue jesus this is in fact called blue de verne now rock four is always considered the king but the prince is the blue de verne because it's younger and sweeter it's just such a beautiful cheese look at the blue that forms on this now some interesting facts about this so this was developed only in about the 1850s so in terms of european cheeses this is really quite a young one now from the southern regions the blue cheeses the same as the rockfall were developed in a cave by a guy called antoine roussel now antoine very brave man noticed that his cheeses started to get a bit of mold on them so instead of just throwing them throwing them out like anybody else would he actually decided to eat them and he really enjoyed the flavors what sort of brave man would do that seriously but what he also developed and this is what he's particularly known for see these blue lines that go through here let me hold it a bit closer you see those and you often notice these in blue cheeses they actually get needled and you might be able to see some small marks in the top here so what happens is that the blue cheese gets needled to let more air into the center of the cheese because for the mold to grow we need to actually get oxygen all the way through the cheese and so by using needles we're able to then get the blue cheese to form and create those wonderful stinky flavors that are blue cheese now back in the day antoine actually used knitting needles for this things have progressed a little bit further and we're now using machines but what an amazing thing what a great invention and i'll tell you what if it wasn't from france one roussel who knows where we'd be without our blue cheese", "GfLsJXsNfpw": "blue cheese we're gonna start with the basics what the hell is it the color blue and mold are terms not normally good when talking about food except in the case of cheese where the addition of mold from the genus penicillin Ricordi produces this blue food that can quite literally chase away the blues", "c6DppsgrH_U": "what's gave you - this is Gopi here coming through with this start of the week three a flower or they 21 a flower real quick

"oBz0Baa_TQA": "hey guys it's hugsley and welcome back to another video so i don't exactly have much of a um a plan as for the dream stuff right now i'm currently working on some some more basic things so i thought to myself since i'm not doing anything else why not make a a cheese review because for those of you don't know i'm a cheese connoisseur you know i really know my cheeses except for american cheese i don't like it it's not real cheese that and that weird string cheese you get like cafeterias in in school you know like in kindergarten or you know like elementary schools like oh you want some cheese here's some string cheese they uh they just toss that in there like no gross but here we have a real delight at least i hope it is um it'd really suck if it wasn't but we have uh doneco extra creamy blue cheese keep refrigerated that's part of the title so let's try it out uh it says extra creamy so i have a butter knife here that should be more than enough to cut it and hey that's that's not bad not the creamiest but it's definitely a little creamy enough right and get a nice good chunk on there now for those of you don't know blue cheese is pretty cool in that it's moldy but it's not bad mold it's actually it has some health benefits too so let's try it out mm-hmm so comparing this to another cheese i've had being saint auger's blue cheese this definitely is a lower tier than that um all right um i'd compare it to like gorgonzola kind of but a little creamier and honestly a little less tasteful um the donoko's not bad uh if you're getting into blue cheese i'd say it's a it's all right it's definitely not very pungent or very um like a assault like it's not very offensive in that it's quite it's it's tame right so saint august blue cheese is quite nice that it's really creamy way creamier than this block of wood comparatively so it's definitely way creamier saint august and it has like a nice um it's salt here but it's also more savory you can really taste the the actual cheese itself whereas this one it's you can taste the cheese still definitely but it doesn't have as much personality to it so there's that and it's not as creamy either it says extra creamy i'm a little scared of what their regular cheese is because this is extra creamy i'm like scared that their regular cheese is just concrete concrete in a tiny little plastic package uh yeah not bad just uh i don't know not very like it's not bad at all it's pretty good but after comparing it to another cheese um the same type kind of but like better i definitely prefer saint august so there you go um now it looks like get rid of the crackers right let's just have a nice chunk of cheese right to test out for ourselves and see like maybe the crackers are messing it up right a little bit of mold in there too because this is just the white stuff let me come on a little mold all right yeah definitely creamy just it doesn't quite melt enough um the taste is has been a little salty a bit a little bit of a spice from the salt i think but it's good yeah no i can definitely eat this whole thing and this other one right here but if i had to choose i'd definitely get stars so with that hope you guys enjoyed i hope now you know something about cheeses you know blue cheese is definitely edible it's actually probably better for you than like cheddar or white vermont or any of those stuff right and they're all good but blue cheese is definitely a bit more varied and with that see you guys next video and bye", "WEmHGgHfzkE": "[Music] I want a nine four five trying piece I

Greene this is episode 5 in our 2020 strain review series this week featuring a strain we like to call slur Akane this is a purple punch cross and it is absolutely fantastic on paper we're gonna try it out let you know what I think of it right now here on the ice smoke channel join me as we talk about the background of the Slovak own cannabis strain so this strain has been bred by in-house genetics dos Eidos crossed with purple punch is the cross that results in the slur akane it is not available as feminized seeds according to the seed find a website and people's reports of it I've read some reviews of it online seem to love this strain as an afternoon even in smoke very indica dominant apparently there's some berry notes that are going to come through as well this is actually in a biodegradable bag which you don't see all the time so it's not in a glass jar but the bag is biodegradable so we're not going to complain there I want a big up right own extracts made some extract out of this but not before I've got to grab a little bit just to make sure that I could feature it in the review video so thank you very much my purple punch and dosa dose I am NOT the biggest fan of dos DOS it looks amazing 10 out of 10 bag appeal and people seem to like it but not my favorite strain purple punch on the other hand I absolutely love Larry og of crossed with granddaddy purple I think it is and that is a phenomenal strain granddaddy purple you literally taste them purple hoping that some of that does carry down into this slower cane I don't know anything about the growing method I don't even know who the grower of this one is really for this channel let's talk about the appearance of this cannabis stroke getting this out of its bag then been a long time since I had weed in a plastic bag I will tell you that usually we're talking glass jars sometimes my lower packs but I like to biodegrade bonus the first thing to mention is it is absolutely caked in trichomes it looks frosty and it's frosty as you like really really strong tricone coverage the buds aren't actually what I expected them to look like and I think that might be something to do with the grow itself the reason being if this is an indica dominant strain so I wouldn't expect these small sativa looking lugs or smaller buds this and this was run into extract which is why there's still bits of stalk it doesn't matter as much when you're extracting it and running it through a Pho other than the bits of stalk I think that the coloration and trichome coverage on this one's wicked it's just the look of these buds sort of suggests that something might have gone wrong during the growing cycle maybe a lot left on when it should have been or come on when it shouldn't have done something like that actually looks a lot like weed you pick up in Amsterdam and I actually did ask the guy was low is this import and is that nice grown in the UK I see this all the time when I go to them this is like haze it's like what the standard damn haze would look like right nuclear green it's got a real skunky look to it but then just full of frost frosty skunky look to it pistols are a muted brown color not even very visible actually looks alright not ten out of ten by any stretch of the imagination not the best looking but still got a nice look to it just hasn't developed in the way I would have expected let's talk about the smell of this lower cane so the online information when you look across multiple website it says creamy OG with an undertone of tropical blueberries now when I'm smelling this slur Akane and particularly this batch of it I'm not sure the tropical is coming through so much it's definitely got a creaminess to it and there it is you've got the gasp of the og and then just a hint of that that blueberry sort of or berry not even blueberries just berry just a sort of fruity mix hint right at the end of the inhalation eat or breathe it nice and deep to try and get that not super smeller like some weight I've opened a bag in a bit like whoa throwing smell up my nostrils like this is not the same even sort of really squeezing it it's not got a lot so that's her potential that is coming out and again put that down to this particular batch don't put it down to the strain itself I'm sure there's some Terp heavy slower cane out there on paper dicey does cross with purple punch sounds great but I do think that don't see those crosses can be a bit watery I don't know about you guys let me know what you think of this in the comments but I really don't like dough lotto and actually smell wise the slower cane isn't really overwhelming we-we've smell so I wonder whether that's gonna translate into the taste speaking of taste let us move on and talk about the taste of the slower cane cannabis strain two methods of consumption for the slower king my trusty chongs Widowmaker bun my mighty vaporizer were smoking it and vaping it should give me a good idea of the flavor that this bud has to offer let's just break some of these stalks out because every single little bud has got a little Stoke attest I don't want to be smoking there this smells like an OG mixed with parma violets or lavender mmm it's really nice actually it's not strong and it's not super apparent in your nostrils this isn't what I would deem offensive smelling cannabis if you don't like weed and someone had this in their pocket you might not even realize but whipping it nice and closely you do tend to get that creamy OG violet pom and violet stroke allowing the types meal we're gonna smoke some we're gonna avoid some we're gonna see how it treats us in this section let's just get everything ready let's prepare our vaporizer and then that way I can turn it on because it's gonna take a couple of minutes and what that's heating up we're going to smoke the bong and I'll see you Oh other side Cheers [Music] that went down really smoothly a lot smoother than I was actually secretly expecting it to go down I did think having a look at the appearance and smell of it that it might not have been the smoothest smoke but that shows me that appearance and smell is not everything that went down super smoothly so much so that we're gonna squeeze another one in and I'm we got to the vaporizers ready Oh got a little bit of time my dad would do it join me for this and I'll see you all on the other side [Music] super smooth smoked cool doesn't really make me need to cough there's not much flavor to it that's what it's lacking in the Turks in the vaporizer it's got kind of an old-school og that's really interesting I had that taste for years what is that it's got kind of like a traditional we taste in the Veda just kind of tastes like like Jim realized cannabis taste but in a nice way I mean I like the flavor of cannabis in general so I'm typing I'm feeling it trying to pick out and see whether that any of that violet or the Parma violets or like the lavender final it's the color not a flavor Tyler what you saying I'm talking about lavender palm of violets is the sweet what flavor it out I'm trying to get that now through the vapor but I can't detect it so much yeah this one hasn't got a lot of Terps in its not reached it's sort of Terp potential and I don't know whether this is me having been fortunate enough to be smoking nothing but no-till for the past I don't know three or four months so I've really gotten a full flavor of potential of the weed I've been smoking I'm not getting that from this so much he still tastes clean that's the really good thing about it it just doesn't taste like much you know I mean and this could well be part of this lower cane flavor so what I want to know from you in the comments if you've tried it because I get wateriness from dalat oh right don't lotto don't doze Crosby gelato this is dosed doze across with purple punch tastes a bit like watered-down purple punch you know I mean maybe it's the dosa doze that I'm not enjoying let's talk about the effects of this slower Akane as I talk to you now and as I grind up for another bomb the effects are starting to kick in this is an indica dominant body lead hi it's gonna relax you it's gonna make you feel good and I'm starting to feel that right about now actually yeah I'm feeling a nice sort of body lead but also slightly cerebral like just nice this just washing over my body and a calm just washing over my mind actually in fact kind of notice in different sounds in the air a bit more definitely kind of it's an enjoyable smoke right from how this high starting to kick in this is the first time I've ever smoked it never smoke slower came before I haven't smoked any in the build-up to this review just read about it I've got no resistance to this profile so it should hit me quite hard for what it is as opposed to think I've been smoking for a week now that being said I'm feeling a niceness just wash over me a mildness a kind of relaxation even in smoke don't turn off and we're done with you and I like to smoke invite one after the other cuz it gives me kind of a sense of you kind of feel it as your vape and you feel the high creeping in if you just vape on its own you don't really feel it creeping in with if you get bummed first and then hit the vaporizer whoosh you get a nice little nice little right maybe sort of a mild tiredness washing over me at this point it's considering it is still or it's just about the afternoon when I'm filming this feeling very very chilled out could definitely sit and watch TV or play some video games and it's a nice high you know it's got that kind of and I guess this comes from the granddaddy purple side of the lineage that kind of like hug hi where you kind of feel like like a warm hug do you not I mean it's a really nice really nice sort of feeling I think it goes all the way back to the Afghan strains and then into things like lavender into granddaddy purple through that and then through the slower okay so yeah overall effects wise I'm really happy with this higher it's a nice distinguishable high from other highs you know it doesn't just feel samey it doesn't just feel like I'm up or I'm really there's a lot to it it's complex you know and I like that about it that about covers the effects unless something's up so today we've been enjoying the slower cane at cannabis Train not sure on the grower of this one but I must say is not the not scored top marks from me on this occasion despite the appearance of it being a little bit smaller and the smell of it being a little bit less chirpy than I was expecting the high of it was still really really nice now flavor-wise a little bit on the wall to reside and I'm wondering whether that's such an egg thing that those dos talk to me about dicing those in the comments come on I want to hear from you don't heed those experts effects wise I love the effect of this one nice warm relaxed body lid - a nice and chill in my mind as well just gonna smoke this bong join me for this one and I'll see you all on the other side [Music] yeah just like watery type you know it could be like literally part of it interest in it stuff I like it but it's not getting top marks because of a couple of factors that we've mentioned in the review but what do you think of the slur Akane and what do you think of

"Ec9VDxKxUv8": "guys this is some of the meals that we've been having for dinner recently i'm just firing up in here onions mushroom pepper and garlic there's also quite a bit of black pepper in there this afternoon trevor has made some tortilla wraps so we're gonna be having the steak in there this is a steak i'm gonna slice it into thin strips and we're gonna have it with this blue cheese and those onions and bits in the wraps got the steak in the pan now with some butter i'm doing the steak quite well done today and adding the blue cheese into the pan because i'm having a baby and i don't want any raw beef in here but normally i like my steak very rare and similarly with the blue cheese i'm going to add half of this into the pan normally i would just crumble it straight into the wraps i didn't want to make a separate blue cheese sauce because we're having it in wraps i thought it would make it a bit too wet but you can see this cheese is melting down on the bottom of the wraps i've just put spinach and natasha's just having this little one with hers tonight for dinner we are having pork chops with macaroni cheese well i guess they're pork pork what do they call them pork steaks um i managed to get cheese red leicester cheese from the international store it was really expensive but oh it's so nice it's gonna make really nice macaroni i'm really looking forward to doing it tonight i've got the pork steaks in the pan and i'm just gonna make a roux start this cheese sauce i've added milk to the flour and butter and it's starting to thicken now i want to see it just starting to bubble on the top before i put the cheese into it and those steaks are pretty much done i also did a little bit of broccoli in the pasta water too okay the heat is off and i'm just gonna whisk in this cheese now this cheese sauce is done i'm just gonna add pasta into it okay so these are our dinners tonight so much macaroni cheese mistakes got a little bit overdone there i think the cheese isn't as cheesy as i would like but it's still the best cheese i've found so far let's get tucked into this i'm making a lasagna tonight for dinner it's gonna have a layer there's like a tomatoey layer with peppers and carrots and onion and then a spinach layer which i've got a little bit of leek that i'm putting in and then i just poured um hot water through this spinach which i'm going to dice up and do in a white sauce i'm starting with the tomato sauce and i'm just frying all of that together and i've got some garlic in there now as well so making a little bit of white sauce i started with the roux again and i've just added in half a stock cube so i just crumbled it in it takes a little bit to melt down so you haven't got the lumps of stock cube and i've rinsed i showed you this was been rinsed with hot water i squeezed the excess liquid out of it and then chopped the spinach up and this is going to go in here with the little bit of leek and also a little bit of nutmeg so now i'm gonna layer these up into this glass dish with the lasagna sheets i've actually got quite a lot of the tomato sauce i think i might save some of that for nachos later in the week so these are the layers and then the last layer i'm going to put mozzarella cheese on top so this is the lasagna ready to go which i'll put into the oven this evening this is the leftover sauce and i also boiled up some carrots and broccoli that's for lunches i'm trying to decide whether to do some bread rolls to go with the lasagna for tonight i think i think i might do also open the tin of sweetcorn and wash the tomatoes to go in there and then normally at lunchtime natasha has some veggies and a sandwich and i'll have the same as well i put this foil on so the top layer of cheese didn't burn but the cheese is actually stuck to the foil okay i managed to get the tin foil off i only lost a little bit of cheese here i'm just gonna put this back under the oven to get it crispy oh i'm just about to cut into it and i forgot to film it it didn't crisp up very much but we're ready to eat now so i'm just gonna go for it so this is our lasagna for tonight i didn't make any rolls for it but i'm just gonna slice up some tomatoes to go with it tonight for dinner i'm doing nachos i'm just frying up a chicken breast and then i've got the tomato sauce that's left from last night i'm gonna layer it all up with some cheese and then we'll serve it with salsa and sour cream i managed to get this from the international store which i was really pleased about because i didn't have any in the supermarket when i did the grocery haul before i have the tomato sauce in i'm just putting some taco seasoning into the pan get the focus just coat the chicken with that and then i'll add the tomato sauce which will loosen up this bit on this pan as well at christmas i was able to get unsalted tortilla chips and i only bought one bag and then i went back to buy more and they're all out and they haven't had them since so we're back to the salted crisps i do really like the salted ones but i would just prefer for an attache to them for them to be unsalted so i've got tortillas and salsa okay i'm just putting the last bit of cheese onto the top of this now and i'll pop it in the oven and the nachos are ready they look good so tomorrow night for dinner we are having an otalengi dish which is chicken with chicken thighs with um lemons and zatar which i've got here and it's also got onions and garlic in it but you have to marinate the chicken thighs overnight so i'm just going to pop everything into the dish now and leave it to do its thing that's done now just leave that in the fridge and i'm going to get started on tonight's dinner tonight for dinner we are having steak and potatoes it's actually really sunny today so the light is off in this room and yes we're having steak and potatoes i'm just roasting these potatoes only in oil and black pepper no salt because i'm going to make a dressing that's got anchovies in it to go over the steak and that will be quite salty so it won't need anything else on the potatoes so okay so here's why no salt i'm putting capers and anchovies into this salsa and it's also got lemon juice garlic lots of parsley and a hard-boiled egg so it's got oil in it it's a dressing and the egg is to emulsify it but i've always done i've never done a cooked egg before but i'm following the recipe from serious eats which i will link below and then i like to follow the recipe properly the first time and then the second time i'll make my own adaptations to it it calls for a hard-boiled egg so we're gonna go with that and this all just goes in the blender so i've got everything in here now capers garlic anchovies parsley the egg which is the one that's steaming and then there's some oil in it too i'm gonna blitz this up okay this is the sauce it's actually really nice i just had some off the blades all of the flavors are coming through it's like you can taste them all individually but it's also a cohesive sauce i like it there's a lot more liquid than i expected coming out of this steak i dropped a little bit of butter in there but i want some of that liquid to evaporate sometimes meat has injected water which which isn't good okay i did manage to get some colour on the steak in the end so these are the potatoes i also did a bit of roast broccoli the anchovy capers parsley sauce which i guess is a salsa verde i always think of salsa verde as being with green tomatoes but this one is two and that's it ready to go tonight we're having this chicken tray bake which i set up to marinate overnight it's looking good the um it's not the best tray i could do with a better oven tray i think but the oil and the spices seem to have clung together and then the stock and the lemon juice has separated a bit so i might need to give it a bit of a stir around i've tried to spread everything the flavor should have permeated all through it overnight so let's pop it in the oven i'm gonna normally i would do it for about 45 minutes but these are quite small pieces so i'm just going to give it 30 to start and see how it gets on the chicken is nearly done now it's ended up having 40 minutes at 200 degrees i am just browning off some um pine nuts this is like a whole bag of pine nuts that's all you get you don't need very many though it's just for a topping and i've got a tiny bit of parsley here also to go on the top of this dish once it's done tonight this is going to be like a double dinners dish but i'm cooking it all now because usually when we do a meal for the freezer we just want to reheat it quickly so there wouldn't be time to bake it all and we can just um reheat it quickly this is the chicken out of the oven it's looking really good and we're having this over rice tonight and this is the chicken dish tonight all ready to go for tea today i'm doing pesto with i'm just mixing this pesto with pasta it's a bit of a leftovers tea tonight i've also got a little bit of sweet corn and a little bit of cheese to go with that and then the tomatoes and the last of the anchovies are in the oven

from raw and much more with the code Kanna basics let's get started here's what you gonna need to make cannabis cheese you're gonna need a quart of milk that's whole milk you also want to need a cup of buttermilk 2 to 3 grams of cannabis some lemon juice some sea salt of course you're also gonna need some crackers and maybe some heirloom tomatoes to have with it and you're also going to need some cheesecloth the first step is going to be to grind your cannabis I'm using about 2 or 3 grams of a hybrid but you could use an indica you could use this sativa if you want more of an uplifting effect and you could use more or less cannabis but I'm finding that 2 grams will be nice for about 4 or serving block cheese and I have ground that into sort of a medium fine consistency and for this recipe we're going to be d carving this dry in the oven and I like to cover that with a piece of foil to keep the smell down but just so you know it's still gonna smell pretty strong so just be forewarned about that smell if cannabis is going to fill your house and I'm going at 225 for 1 hour and 50 minutes if my oven went to 220 I would put it to 20 for two hours but my oven goes to 225 and I'm just going to modify the time down a little bit and after your d carbs you're gonna have a double boiler setup to move on to the next step which is going to be confusing and you can see after the two hours in the oven that your cannabis is toasted nice and lightly browned not too Brown just barely lightly and it has a nice kind of ammonia aroma okay we're going to put that decarboxylated or activated cannabis into our double boiler and that's belonging a little heavy there I'm gonna reduce that heat so that doesn't boil so hard you want to do this nice and slow and we're adding in one half of our milk it's actually a little less than half of it we're putting in two cups now or one pint which is about half of the court that we're going to use in the recipe but we need a little bit of extra - to add in what's going to evaporate out of this over time so we have our milk and our decarboxylated cannabis in our fusion pot and now we're gonna let that infuse on a nice low temperature for two hours at minimum you could go a little longer if you want these milk infusions can take a little while but we want to make sure that it's nice and infused also during that time you're gonna periodically stir it so it doesn't get too much of a film if you keep it covered it's also gonna help keeping the film from gathering and in the meantime you might want to go ahead and squeeze out your lemons if you're using fresh lemons and string that through and get you some lemon juice and all we're gonna need about two teaspoons of lemon juice but you might want to have a little additional prepared because sometimes people don't get their milk curdled enough and you need some more so just you need about two but now I want to have about up to four teaspoons and okay so we've got about two hours now our infusion is done we're going to take it off the heat carefully there you also want to make sure that you've left water in your in your double boiler don't let that run out and dry out okay but there we go we have our milk it's been infused with the cannabis okay and so carefully not like I did but carefully strain that milk through a a sieve of some sort and actually I had cheesecloth and I should have used cheesecloth with a step it have been a lot easier to squeeze it all out so I would recommend if you have enough extra cheese cloth just to go ahead and use cheesecloth to strain that through about four layers and squeeze it nice but either way you want to strain out all of the plant material from your milk and what you're gonna have is your strong cannabis smelling and lightly almond colored infused milk now you could use that milk for other recipes if you want but we're gonna be making cheese with it so go ahead and use some more milk and fill that back up to two cups so this is where we're adding in we had lost almost a half a cup during the operation so we added 1/2 cup milk back in so that we're going to end up with a total of one quart of milk into our thick pan or a thick bottom sauce pan and we're going to put that on medium-low heat [Music] okay and this is where it's gonna be important if you have a thermometer because what we're gonna do and you can also use your high balls but you want to just just before it starts to simmer which is about 175 degrees we're gonna heat our milk up to that temperature and once you get to 175 degrees you're going to pour in your half a cup of buttermilk just pour that all right in there and then you're gonna start with your two teaspoons of lemon juice and what we're doing here is we're adding s acidity and also some more fat with that buttermilk and what we're doing is curdling our milk and curdling is going to separate our milk into whey which is the liquid part and curds which is going to be the thick part so once you add your ingredients in take it off the heat and now we're going to let it sit for 10 minutes and curl and by curdling I mean it looks like this cottage cheese types of consistency is going to separate itself out from the liquid which is the way and the curds are the thick part and then the next step is going to be to separate the curds and the whey and what we're doing here is that we're using about four layers of cheesecloth over a colander if you have a colander use that I didn't my collars and storage so I headed up using this little screen it was a little small so use a colander if you have that and what we're going to do is gently very easily scoop out those curds from the milk now you don't want to mash these or squeeze them out or anything like that you generally want to do it just just take the time and gently scoop them all out until you all have this cottage cheese looking consistency into your colander or your strainer I can take a few minutes to do that but just be patient and do it and you might have a little bit left in the bottom and you can you can run that through a smaller sieve if you want there if you just want to make sure you get all the curds separated out and when it comes to the way which is the liquid that's left over don't throw that away it's got a little bit of cannabis in it most of our cannabis is in our curds which has about 10 times the fat of the way and most of our cannabis is going to be into our fat it's gonna have transferred in there during the infusion process but there is some left in that way and you can make pancakes you can make sourdough bread you can do lots of things with that way so feel free to to reuse that unlike other kind of us recipes you can use that leftover now what I've done is I've tied a little slip knot and once we have our weight sitting there we let that sit for about 10 minutes also to separate out some of the heavy moisture and then after about 10 minutes sitting on that colander you're going to use a piece of twine I'm using cooking twine there and then tie off that cheesecloth at the top now if I to use the Colorado had a little bit bigger piece of cheesecloth which would have been an idea but that's fine the way it is there and then we're going to tie that on a stick or a wooden spoon if you have one and we're gonna set that over some pot big enough so that it's suspended in the air so that the water can drip off of it and now we're going to let that sit for 30 minutes so after 30 minutes of draining we're gonna take our cheese ball and right now it's unsalted and it's probably gonna tastes pretty flat right now but it is already cheese you see those nice cheesecloth marks on there and just as a note I want to thank Chef John from food wishes for his recipe that we're adapting here he's one of my heroes chef John thanks for the recipe check out food was just if you want to see more of his recipes and to get the flavor the way we want it I'm using sea salt but you can use regular salt if you want but I prefer the sea salt flavor in there you want to mix that in gently with our cheese we're salting our cheese now for flavor and if you wanted to add in some other herbs or garlic or basil or oregano and stuff like that and flavor your cheese up this would be the good time to do that and now what we're going to do is we're going to crock up our cheese and I've got this just little crock here you can use a ramekin or whatever dishing yeah that you'd want to use there and you can also line that dish with cheesecloth if you'd like to have the little cheesecloth marks on it when you're done and also make it easier to remove but I just didn't do that step because I'm gonna serve it right out of my crock there but you definitely want to cover it so that it doesn't dry out so you can use your cheesecloth or whatever but then still cover it and put that in the refrigerator let that go overnight now you could eat it fresh if you want but I just think the flavor sets a ho much better and also I pressed the top down to get a little shape into it and pressing it also made it a little more creamy after it set overnight so there we go this cheese is so good you get a really like tangy distinct flavor of the cannabis if you're attuned to it but also has kind of a tart flavor from the buttermilk and the acidity and it's you could use it any way you want to achieve I'm serving you here just like as an hors d'oeuvre crackers with some sliced heirloom tomatoes fresh ground pepper and some olive oil it's a really good snack you've got about four servings here there would be about a half a gram apiece you can make about eight or so crackers or more with with one serving but you could also use it as pastries or just write on bread you could use it any way that you would use kind of fresh cheese so I really hope you enjoyed this recipe I enjoyed making it please check out ralph STD a smoke shop if you're in the market

is the growers notes special where we go over the tips tricks and lessons learned from the blueberry headband indoor and outdoor grows but before we do if you want to help grow this community don't forget to subscribe to this channel and don't forget to like the content and let me know you're enjoying it I'll bring on the blueberry headband [Music] seeds were purchased from the humble seed organization and a breeders pack and they had a hundred percent germination rate frog these ceilings hate Allah water they had a preference for being misted you see the plants in the back here they're drooping after getting some reverse osmosis water [Music] the vegetative cycle these plants were pretty straightforward and they grew quite quickly they were fed with reverse osmosis water and when they were finally big enough we took some clones and we had some amazing results [Music] here we use the probe xbx mycorrhizae a growing medium as the soil choice watch the clones had produced some healthy-looking roots we put them outdoors for the first week and a half they grew slowly but after that they quickly blossomed it wasn't long until you can see the sativa dominant fan leaves when it came to flowering there is no surprises here the plants ran a full ten weeks in the flowering stage [Music] from the two plants ever growing indoors the yielded three ounces of dried cannabis each aroma from the bud was sweet and floral and theirs was great for a day smoke as it was more of a sativa based rain and the effects can be best described as euphoric head high but growing the blueberry headband outdoors was a completely different story [Music] strean was amazing to grow up until the flowering cycle thus when the headache really began at the end of the summer when these plants start to go into bud there is a lot of rain and humidity which unfortunately we got white powdery mildew and this particular strain doesn't have a resistance to mildew so all the fan leaves were stripped off to improve the airflow around the plant and it was also aggressively treated hydrogen peroxide but despite this minor setback we got some frosty nuggets out of this plant and for those concerning growing the strain I would recommend growing this indoors versus growing it outdoors and that brings us to the harvest and cure results [Music] when it comes to caring we prefer the dry care method with hanging the plants whole only the larger fan leaves are stripped off during this period branches were hung through a total of 10 days they were then trimmed up and placed on a drying rack for another four days the way you can expect is a two-week drying period [Music] this was a really fun strain to grow and I went growing again but only indoors I would not take my chances growing these outdoors again and that's because of the lack of mildew resistance I do need plants that can deal with the humidity fluctuations as well as the changes in weather in August and September it could be a drought or it can be really rainy it just depends on the season I hope this video helps you to make your judgment if you want to grow this strain or not you've heard from me and now I want to hear from you leave me a comment below if this is a strain that you would grow for yourself [Music] us all for this week's video if you want to help grow this community don't forget to subscribe to this

for roast chicken and she served it with an amazing load of side dishes the main dish was chicken and lemons and zatar I'm definitely going to be recreating it at home so Laura's mentioned that we're having pizza for tea sometime this week and that's tonight so I'm making the pizza bases I've done a mixture of the strong white flour and einkorn flour which is an ancient grain very old and it seems to make a really nice consistency it's nice and stretchy but that doesn't doesn't like stretch out too much still retains its shape I was poking holes so that we don't get big air bubbles in the middle of the middle of the base here is a finished pizza doesn't that look good nice melty mozzarella cheese there the goat's cheese should be nice and soft figs are a bit bit cooked and we put some asparagus on cuz that's in season and it goes well with the goat's cheese oh we need to put balsamic glaze on it too hold on a second there we go now we're gonna have that with rocket on the side tonight I'm doing a chicken stew for tea so I'm just browning it off the chicken thighs I've already done some of them they were coated in a mix of flour and some spices and turmeric and some cumin in there salt and pepper and then I'm gonna add the vegetables to it so I've got some mushrooms I also think I've got another carrot in the fridge a couple of carrots I'm gonna do and a couple of bleep so got it all in the pan now I've also added a vegetable stock cube you don't really want it to boil they say a stew boiled is too spoiled so I'm gonna turn that down it just got a bit hot I've also got some dumplings exact aren't Bessey's ones I just frozen they take 12 minutes to do this is the stew or reduce down it's nice and thick and ready to go and these are the dumplings and this is the chicken stew plated up ready to go we're having meatballs for tea so I'm just gonna take a few out of this bag this is how for every more before I did freeze them raw they're not cooked but I froze them out on this ice bank the rest of the meatballs I did roll out and put into the freezer I put them in raw and put it on this grease three paper in a tray and they're frozen now so I can put them all together into a back but if you don't freeze them individually they just all stick together in like a big lump and they actually made loads of meatballs so we've got plenty of those and we're having that with some frozen mashed potato and then I'm gonna get some broccoli from the garden to go with it and these are the meatballs and just reheating them in this glass dish I'm also using frozen mashed potato I've just taken it out of the plastic bag that was in the freezer and there's a little bit of water in the bottom of this path and I'm just gonna put the lid on it that water will heat up and it'll soften a bit and then I can break it down and then the mashed potato it just starts to melt down into the liquid it looks a bit wet at the moment but it won't be once that big solid lump in the middle has melted to the mash is coming together now peanut and broccoli from the garden this is a super quick dinner so we're having instant gravy granules as well and you add to this a little bit of cream which makes it like the gravy that you get like here I get quite thick you don't actually need that much cream and those weasels take about 20 minutes from frozen so I'm going to put the gravy over this and also serve it with some lingonberry jam it is a quick dinner but it was a little bit heavy on the dishes I guess that's okay because I have got some time to wash up and we're ready to go so Swedish style meatballs with mash broccoli from the garden and lingonberry jam with creamy gravy tonight for dinner we are having these pies they're Charlie bignum pies they've risen hugely in the oven I'm really impressed with them and we're having them with boiled potatoes and I'm just gonna put them on to a bed of lettuce actually they're served in my face ceramic dishes this is kind of just stop the dishes from shaking around all over the place so we're gonna eat it sitting on the sofa so this is dinner ready to go this was not our plan dinner this evening and Trevor just picked these pies up on his way in because they cook quite quickly I didn't take anything out of the freezer for dinner in time that waffle I took out and I was gonna eat from my lunch just been one of those days so we've got this is a quick dinner instead it's also why I chopped up the potatoes so small so they cooked really quickly tonight we're having a salad for tea so I'm just prepping up all the vegetables here it was going to be it Caesar salad so I shaved some parmesan to put on the top of it and I poached the chicken already this morning I've had that in the fridge but just realize we haven't got any Caesar dressing so I'm gonna make some kind of blue cheese dressing I think I've got some cream and I've got some mayonnaise so I'm gonna just mix some of those together and see why I'm sure I can come up with just a like cheesy dressing for it I've also got some capers there and a big thing of iceberg lettuce and some chickpeas just going to do a big chunky salad I've diced up the parsley and put it in the bowl with the chickpeas and then the other vegetables and each of the bowls is gonna have a chicken breast on it and I'm gonna also finely shred the lettuce so diced up the lettuce and I've also mixed up the I guess it is a blue cheese sauce it's cream mayonnaise like equal amount of both half of the blue cheese and then a dash of white wine vinegar just mixed it all together it's nice and thick I think that's gonna be a nice dress and this is one of those Mecca salad bowls ready to go we are having rack of lamb I think it's a probably a spring lamp extra yummy just roasting it in the oven just put some potatoes in which is what halfway done so they get cooked nicely with it she would company the land we are having some sauteed vegetables just carrots and some broccoli really good so this is our lamb served up for this evening thanks for watching this week guys and I'll see you again soon bye bye [Music]", "P1t7lGtOkVQ": "hi guys follow me on instagram to never ever miss any of my crazy updates hi guys and welcome to another vlog i am driving this this is the tata indigo marina and it was another variant of the indy car so you can just say it an indica station wagon version and as you can see it looks like an indica at the front i would have opened the engine bay but that's not opening right now meanwhile the tires as you can see are extremely on the smaller side 175 65 14 no nonsense the good part of course is that this is a station wagon which means that you can carry a lot more luggage inside the car and i'm sorry about this but people just photo bombing video bombing so the name is indigo i is missing and marina lx is the variant td 60 is i think it produces 60 horsepower but somewhere it produces 70 horsepower so you can decide at your own description what is the power vertical tail lights and again this will remind you of the indica we've got roof rails as well so in terms of design this car really wasn't impressive although this was one of a kind station wagon let's open this which means that i have to actually put the key inside to open it and i'm just so bad at this yeah here we go oh god i'm so sorry here we go again yep okay this is not working the struts but you see the boot carrying capacity is quite decent as such now of course this is having auto closed boot which is quite cool now the tailgate closes on its own no central locking in this car uh which means i cannot get inside i will try to do that from the other side and uh where is it where is it where is it no this is not unlocking the cast i have to put my hand here and do it now of course all these features were not expected when this car was launched so there's nothing wrong with that and now we finally open the door like you not when i applied brakes these seats went forward and they dropped back let me put them back actually this decent amount of space on offer quite comfortable too and this seems like an ashtray there's an ash tree here power windows on all the doors too seats are decently comfortable you can recline it if you want to carry more luggage and the floor is not completely flat meanwhile i have to credit durga car decor here in pune for lending me this tata indigo marina which is kind of a classic car now because that old storage space those pockets have not much things but you see where the power window controls well they are in the center right there seats are actually quite comfortable decently comfortable a lot of buttons here these are of course for the lights i believe i think for the rear viper too because when they designed the indica they never thought they'd make a station back in version dashboard design as you can see has aged quite a lot and the color has changed from what was beige earlier to right now being beige with sort of black finishing glove box was lockable storage space inside is dc that couple of remotes too i think that is after market and i think this is also after market for sure air conditioning nothing much to talk about as such but when i turn on the car you can hear a lot so here we go okay clutch lock yeah there you see the instrument cluster there's a digital display which is obviously for the odometer and the trip meters and everything is analog the design really needed a lot of work back in the day no automating inside your mirror some of these things i'm actually quite wary of touching as well because yeah there's no mirror on the driver's side the driver didn't want to see his face of course while driving this car the fuel economy was of course pretty nice and decent in fact it would return somewhere around almost 18 to 90 kilometers per liter this switch is for i think headlight leveler and this storage space below here so you just see anywhere and everywhere tata motors used to put a storage space but otherwise there's not much storage space inside this car power window control like i told you this storage space there as well this should open yeah it opens this space here as well i think that's an ashtray but that's that well let's just get driving shall we all right let's start the car yeah there it literally rose to life we're not actually driving a car we're driving a tractor because that's the level of sound from this tata indigo marina and the reason for all the sound is quite obvious which is that this engine is supremely noisy now this doesn't have a common rail i'm actually full on the throttle and because it has good amount of torque it gets going really hard and fast but somehow the clutch is so hard it's so hard it's like you are pressing a rock every time but the actuator pedal is also very hard so that's like the speed alarm in older cars this actually has a speed alert system without even having one because every time i get into the throttle i have to take another additional effort to get going now what tata did was launch this car with three engines yeah that's right three freaking engines one was a petrol which absolutely nobody cared about and two were diesels one is of course this one both the 1.4s and one was a tdi which again is this one produces 70 ps of power and 132 newton meters of torque the other one was the dicor which is a common rail engine which produced six newton meters of additional torque making it slightly better but what was the main point of that dicor engine not the performance obviously it was slightly better but it was absolutely more refined and you know when i'm saying refine it's nothing as refined as what is today's modern diesel cars but compared to this one which has no refinement whatsoever it was very very refined this is of course not really a performance car because the gearbox is extremely notchy the clutch is so heavy and the engine well it makes its presence felt in every given moment however there is good amount of torque which means that although there is amount of lag it's quite well controlled mid-range feels strong this guy was really very fuel efficient would return somewhere around 20 kilometers per liter so while driving in the city you would realize that you could you could just drive it very comfortably yes there is a lot of amount of sound also coming in but as a practical alternative the indigo marina was absolutely something which was unseen and unheard of because tata motors engineers had no work in those days what they did was they took the indigo and they started making a lot of cars there was the indigo xl indigo marina and the variants were like absolutely crazy so many variants i'm 100 with the sorted everything is fine till you hit 3000 rpm after 3000 rpm now it becomes even more vocal but this isn't the fast driving motor per se there you go see the noise brakes are decent actually i'm quite surprised the brakes are decent and the pedals feel like a rock but the brakes don't feel like a rock which is actually a good thing meanwhile the ride is quite good that's actually usb steering has absolutely no feel or feedback so there was no concept of feel or feedback back in those days when tata motors launched this car actually yeah taking a u-turn could be some amount of effort now we're going to take a reverse which is another sort of an effort here we are into reverse you see the steering actually feels heavy because i believe it's an hydraulic unit this is easy to drive because visibility is good and i've stalled it i have stalled it yeah i have stole it please wait sir first time driver did we put a l plate on this car i think i should here we go come on left foot on the brake no no no no no if it was any other car now i would have reached my destination by now but not on this one it takes its own sweep time to get going but then tata cars were not known for that and look at the iron if you're driving an indigo marina and there is the indigo ecs the amount of variants which were available of this car were absolutely staggering i honestly don't know why tata launched so many variants where they're like okay you know what we can make a station you know what we can make a limousine the xl and i'm not kidding the indigo xl actually competed with the mercedes-maybach s650 v12 i'm just kidding obviously i'm kidding because the size of the hood of the mai bag and the full length of that car is exactly the same yeah that was like sub 4 meter this is not sub 4 meter by the way this is not sub 4 meter i remember my girlfriend that time in school days her best friend had bought an indigo marina and she said she bought a honda city and i was also having a honda city so when i went to the honda dealership for a service they should come in the indigo marina to take a test drive and i was like what why didn't you even tell me that maybe you know the image issue back in those days now of course tata motors has come a long way and after driving this car the tiago the tigor all of them feel like a different generation all together come on baby it actually rests past four and a half thousand rpm but this tdi motor is not about performance it's about efficiency and it was also very attractively priced the problem in those days were that there were not many diesel alternatives and now of course we are again reaching the same situation of not having many diesel alternatives but as i see it the indigo marina used to attract a different set of buyers who wanted a station wagon but they had no other option obviously you had more expensive options actually you don't have any option not even the expensive ones because the whole system was so restricted and that's that and i think that you know let's just jump into some other car because i'm done with this tata indigo marina i don't know why they called it marina maybe it should drown in the ocean or something of that sort i'm so sorry all you tata fans but tata motors old cars really needed a lot of work i'm glad they've come a long way although the image spoiled by such cars can't be changed can't be rectified so soon either and on that bombshell it's time to end bye bye let me just check what i said yep [Music] you", "PBOAksn6H6Y": "so here we are Geneva on the TARDIS turn emotions are all very well and good for seeing the lace supermodels we very rarely get to drive anything today we're going to do something a little bit different with the Tartu electric car obviously there's a limited scope to judge this car because here we are Geneva driving around the back of the number-6 Hall I believe it is and there's no track anything so we're just having a gentle drive down here I've been lucky enough to drive the Nissan Leaf and this car when it goes on sale will actually be around about the same sort of prices a leaf I'd have to say that the interior quality's not in the same league as miss zone and this this car doesn't have niceties like power steering and it doesn't have any air conditioner either they're both those systems power steering and air conditioning obviously will eat into the battery life so you can kind of understand them being left left off the extended equipment list but as safe in terms of value for money then I would have to say that the Nissan looks like it would probably offer you more for your money if this is what this one is quite a very early car a very prototype car steering wheels not even on straight but it does give us just a glimpse in for the future so I always say so pretty in everything it picks up instantaneously like all electric motors because the power is delivered let's say as soon as you put your foot down you all you have to do is slot it into drive and you're off so here we've got yet another entry into the growing electric market from Tata it's an interesting little car the quality's not quite as good as the Nissan Leaf for instance and these cars will be selling about the same sort of price so just on the quick dry and brief driver that I've had round now it is actually a pretty nippy quiet efficient car what are you have to say looking at the Nissan it's a far more grown-up vehicle and if you want my advice that's where I'd be put

defoliate and super crop the sea lemon amnesia point this is exactly what I do three weeks in the flowerin to maximize my yields I'm talking huge but looking at is a lemon amnesia plant which is about 21 days in the flowering and she's forming beautiful flowers today we're going to defoliate and super crop this plant so I'm gonna jump right into and show you exactly how I do it I'm gonna keep [Music] the named Nizar this base we've just been D foliated we just open this plan up drastically you can actually see the buds now if you look close you know formation oh it is anyway next step I'm gonna kind of look over the plant and I'm gonna super crop it a little bit and even out the canopy some of these bigger tall ones in the back I definitely want to target and aim this way I think the canopy that even canopy is looking about like this for these guys so I'm gonna go ahead and take this one here [Music] it's a squeeze and twist [Music] lay that fight over towards level with when I do that right there I typically take them off the leaf that is the biggest on the top and the bottom of that but potentially kind of just blocks it over the life you show you the rest of the plants here in the whole tent now three weeks in a major defoliation and super cropping on the right now is my lemon amnesia that's just what we did right next to it here this was done yesterday this is the glossa that completely is now been opened up quite a bit and you can see completely recovered nicely from any kind of super cropping best for their so that was that bud was facing down yesterday not space over here Sour Diesel right Amherst sour the same situation everything's all these little buds that got you know it's like the tornado did come through here yesterday and it laid all these plants down and this morning the Sun came up and these plants are extremely resilient so they're bouncing right back up the Wookiees plant back in the back same deal all the buds are not facing upward you know you can see this is last one I've done so that's one just now starting to recover right long stem coming up you see the buds starting to face up towards the light again this is higher plant screaming at the light by the today the gorillas breath planted back in the back here now you can really see and you know the nice thing is if you look from the top down you can pretty much in some situations see the floor and that's exactly what you want at this stage open it up let the get some real good air flow in here so I'm watering here now I'll show you what I got going on with that I just got my my water mixed up a cow mag it's about 200 ppm 6.5 on the pH my ice pack in there taking the temp down to 65 there's water and [Music] we said it's a stressful kind of time for the plant so you want to definitely make sure you give it everything it needs afterwards recover you might think I'm putting a lot of water in here right now doing this and a plant of this size in this stage of growth brings a lot of water this medium being organic soil bollocks or control a decent amount of the water at least for about three days or so see them [Music] I found them out twenty more seconds or so when I get it again in that same man [Music] so thanks for sticking with me for this long video you know look me up on Illinois for club calm I'm trying to help patients out there doing exactly this trouble medicine you can find me on Facebook that chick ran free and you can definitely find me on you got a series from seed to harvest on these plants right here so obviously we're not to the harvest stage yet but we are three weeks in the flowering now and we are not too far along thanks again for watching you guys take care of yourselves and definitely [Music]", "hV-k9Onbs6A": "I've got a legendary strain you've probably never heard of before this trend is pretty rare so you're probably gonna want to stick around today we're smoking on Williams Wonder coming up [Music] hi I'm strange and this is strands of the bay if you're new here I review strands around the Bay Area I also have a second channel where pretty much do everything else I'll link that down in the description and that sounds like something you'd be interested in which I'm sure it does consider subscribing and hitting that Bell button to be notified every time I release video our bonus 15 likes as with all my other videos I think it's pretty possible so you can go ahead and do that now or whenever you feel like it hey at any point during the video check out my links and show notes in the description if you're looking for bonus pipes or anything like that as well as anything else you see here on the screen it's probably gonna be linked down there so go ahead and check that out by the way I'm using this one for the first time today it's this kind of electric ladder as you guys can see I'll give it a thorough view later on but if you guys want to check it out I'll put this in the link in the description as well I've tried it a few times it's pretty [ __ ] sick but yeah you get to see it to work today in a bit and then for the review later on so back to live Williams Wonder is an indica dominant strain so very very couch locked up and feeling no sativa effects pretty much at all so indica dominant as you guys can see the buds tend to have a green yellow and reddish color to them the smell I could smell just right now is the tropical fruit and a bit of citrus but mostly citrus I would say it does have a bit of a party smell as well but citrus is the most dominant smell I could smell I've had this a few times before it does have a sweet and sour taste to it it was also developed in the 80s and I always say this but especially for this train this one is not for new smokers so proceed with caution THC levels are up to 17 to 26% this one right here that you guys see is probably upwards of 26 percent and if you guys are wondering I did pick us up at the Secret Circle this is in the Fremont slash Union City area Freddie is your next delivery man he is the or Secret Circle check them out check out the menu I'll put it down below in the description as well let him know that strain sensor and thank you guys very much to the people that do actually go out to him he has told me that a few of you guys have actually mentioned me and have tried the strings that I recommend it so thank you guys for that I appreciate that as well thank you thank you yeah so you guys are watching this and you want to try it out this particular strain is gonna be sold out real soon so if you're watching this call the number on the description right now it's gonna be gone real soon so the effects you can be expecting a feel ought to be relaxed sleepy happy euphoric and tingly medicinal uses are for stress for paid for insomnia for fatigue and inflammation some negative effects you could feel on this strain are to have dry mouth dry eyes dizziness paranoia and a bit of anxiousness so don't do too much like I said this is a strong strain not for beginners not for lightweights veterans please check it out so flavors you can be expecting a taste are some citrus like I said earlier pine enos a bit of tropical fruits some sweetness and pretty pungent so yeah alright guys it's about that time if you have bongs pipes blunts joints whatever you got go ahead and pull that out now so we're gonna smoke together I'm gonna just run this up real quick and give it a smell test and we can go from there so go ahead and get yourself ready and let me try this [Music] alright guys finish grinding I think and now it's time to give it a quick test let's see what smells like whoo-hoo [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] you man Wow Wow okay goddamn alright so the smells coming off that extremely citrusy the tropical flavors are there it's not very gassy not very cushy but piney citrus tropical a bit of sweetness as well but yeah I'm not too cushy but yeah piny sweet citrusy all around good smells I like the smell I would give it a solid 9 out of 10 like I said I do love the cushy smells but this right here it's been pretty pungent like it smacks you in the face a little bit 9 out of 10 smells great alright so now let me go ahead and put this in here and I can take a hit hope you guys have your stuff up because we're gonna hit this in a few seconds as you can see it's a pretty decent sized bowl so I'm gonna go ahead and hit this now and yeah cheers oh oh actually by the way you get to see this in action this right here is a hemp wet so here goes nada by the way link in the description if you guys want to get one of these not too expensive either so pretty sick so as you guys saw there I was able to take the whole hit without coughing in between so smoothing this 10 out of 10 oh goodness taste is amazing as well very citrusy pining just exactly as the smells so the taste and the smell they're exactly the same so for taste I'm gonna give it a 9 out of 10 but I'm still coughing so let me get my lungs together and I'll be back give me a second all right guys it's about three minutes and I'm still kind of coughing but I guess I can give you guys a little bit better review a review excuse me so this right here I think it's a bit of a creeper even though it's three minutes the effects are still kind of slowly on setting on to me feeling very relaxed is getting harder to speak I can tell my thoughts are getting harder to put together as well so it's really hard for me to keep a conversation I think so if you are out and about this is not the straight for you I think this is best for people with anxiety my body is actually buzzing pretty much I could feel it tingling the head highs pretty clean like my head isn't too heavy or anything like that sometimes because you do get a heavy head but this one I do have a clean head high and my head is floating as opposed to heavy so I do like that aspect of the strain and in my opinion probably most effective for treating pain stress so if you guys are in that department go ahead and check the strain out Secret Circle has it Freddie I think I haven't seen this trend anywhere else in the base so if you are interested in the strain go ahead check it out alright I'm checking in a bit hold on give me a second all right guys four minutes and 48 seconds right now you know what we hit 2,000 subscribers so thank you guys very much for that I appreciate that we're only growing and I know I haven't been making a video I haven't made a video in a month or so but I've been doing a lot of stuff behind the

going to show you how to make this super cute and easy paper butterfly and then this like slightly different ways of finishing it off but that's totally your choice and we'll discuss this at the end now what you will need is a square piece of paper which we're gonna cut in half now I'm tomatoes you can experiment with different sizes it doesn't really matter I think this one is 12 centimeters by 12 centimeters I'm just folding it in half like this so that I can find that central line I'm gonna open up again and cut along the middle now this therefore is no longer origami because we've cut our paper origami is always a square piece of paper with no cutting but I think it's still a very easy craft and it's a great introduction to origami because you use your origami skills for it so now I'm going to turn this round fold it in half again like so we have a nice neat crease and then to shape the bits up here you can either cut or you can just fold them over so I think both work quite well if you fold it you get a nice little pattern at the back so I'm going to fold it like so and then I'm going to fold it over here and over here so when you shut it looks like this so you could have cut it if you prefer okay but I think folding it is quite nice now I'm going to just going to fold these again so now what you need to do is create this concertina effect so I'm going to fold my bottom piece up to about half a centimetres width so this bit that's left here is half a centimetre get it is straight straight as you can and bonus it doesn't have to be exactly half a centimetre it's an approximation okay so when you fold it over you can see this fold here now you fold it down again like so and then you fold it up again like so right and then you repeat the same on the other side so basically your concertina ring your paper around that central line see mine isn't super neat but it will still look cute there we go now fold it in half like a sir and you've got your top half of your butterfly and I the great thing about this is you don't have to use origami paper you can use any paper you've got and you can basically recycle magazines and the like so now you want to do basically a concertina up that way in the same distance so a half a centimeter we go now you need to fold it in half like so and then you need to connect your two pieces now if you wanted to you could add a little bit of glue here but it's not strictly speaking necessary but you know I think it's fine now what I'm going to use is a little bit of embroidery thread in a similar color to my paper now if you don't have embroidery thread you can use normal thread you can use pipe cleaners you can use ribbons like I've done with the purple one over here so again it's one of those things you just have to have a look see what you have around the house and then you tie knot and then you can wiggle the knot up I want it up because then I think this makes quite a good little bit of string for hanging trim the little edge so open up your wings and you have your very own butterfly wasn't that simple so easy and you've got a little string to hang it from now of course you can trim that if you don't like it or here's an example just so you can see you can use some ribbons and leave them as little antennae for your butterfly or you can use some pipe cleaner basically as always have a look what you've got at home and just make your butterflies aren't they lovely now don't forget I've got some other origami butterflies that involved no cutting so proper origami do check those out as well I think they're really lovely but in the meantime I hope you enjoy these oh so simple little butterflies see you again soon bye [Music]", "JUpNRRFxo3U": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]

"y968vIPsiuM": "good afternoon growers it's January 22nd and we're down in the bedroom just checking on the plants now and I'll be watering them once I've recorded the video here today so here's the Bubba push in the back and they're all along the back edge here's about the cushion til right there and then we've got a kosher push beside it it's more kosher crush this Fino of the kosher cush is very different than all the other ones it's very slim sort of delicate looking it's got lots of branches but not a lot of leaf matter to it should be interesting to flower that one out and then these are the three crop cane seeds gelatos and they're not quite as green as they should be as you can see have that a little bit of chlorosis showing or lacking nitrogen I didn't feed them a little bit and in the last couple days but they need a little heavier dose it looks like and this is one of our kosher fish right here and these little plants have come along quite a ways and then this is a gorilla glue and I think the other gorilla glue is right beside it here it's there we are and the third really so when it got a new foam and the video colour is much better than it was and same with the stabilization then my six year old foam that I had so I should be able to record a little better quality of videos and here's the project Reeve edge it's all nice and dark green doesn't need any more food in it so I've just been feeding it playing water the last little while now and I'm not seeing any we're starting to grow anything new yet but I've never done this before so looks like there's some newer looking leaves down on the bottom of this thing come on focus in there big in that area right there the centre of the screen and there was some clones up in my tray I decided I'm not gonna keep the other blueberry so I cut them and threw them in the garbage I kept three of the LSD and I'll knock that down to one just so I can keep those genetics alive for the next little while you definitely want to grow it again and as you can see these guys are still suffering a bit from their transplant they just went too long without food they're starting to green up on the tops now over the next week I'll feed him a little heavier and we'll get them greened up again so there's the canopy for the next run it's pretty even there's a little bit of variation between the plants I'll do a little super cropping on them again today try to get them leveled down so as you can see some of them we're starting to stand up above the group but they're all still very compact and the plants are doing fantastic okay so here's the clones that I have going right now I've overheated them I've got the dome open they've got roots but these were all some really nice pops of the gorilla glue but I didn't water them in time and they dried out so I soaked him and they've recovered and now we got some roots in him this won't be long and I'll stick those into some cubes too so let's go see the flower rooms hey growers it's January 22nd were up here at the drop King tempt taking a look at the gelato and the sour diesels the plants are doing really well we're closing in on the end of their lifes here and we're starting to reduce the food over the next few days and then we'll cut it off all together for the final week of their flower time so here's the tall ones take a look and see how frosty they are as you can see the leaves are starting to fade out now there were these getting lighter but it had pretty good the stun with the fertilisers managed to keep the plants green right up until what I'm cutting their nutrients down and they did really well I'm very happy with this run and we'll see how it comes out through yield the buds look amazing go in and take a look at some of these little gelatos here I got myself a new home so the recording should be much better [Music] yeah words much better really happy it represents the color a lot better than my old home did I don't know how it soo works yet look you gotta try I think that's pretty good look at some of these calyxes are starting to swell as you can see on the flowers and they're starting to put on some decent amount of size over the last week that looks really nice in the phone super-happy okay so that's the tempt - go check could arrested them and here's the other crop concedes gelato and sour Diesel's I went and I just threw a piece of trellis over the top of him because the buds were starting to fall against each other and the walls and then stood them all back up the plant in the back left corner it's ppm when I check it out runoff is always 300 less than the food that's going in so it was a real eater and because of that it's running low on nutrients over the last week here I thought it was because of a light hot spot but you can see the coloring has changed all over the whole plant not just the top for the - this is definitely starting death headaches way out and it was the first to flower it flowered fairly quickly and it developed some really nice sized spots this about was looking really good as a keeper out of the gelatos the one beside it here looks frosty er than it but it's much slower to write them and this one is about the furthest behind but it did get the tallest although the buds aren't quite as big as some of the other ones it's still really nice [Music] look at some of those look down inside here and we can see how big these things really caught Kent really I've got him tied up now I can't spring him out good try they're in okay so that's the crop King seeds and here's our weather-beaten poor plant she survived he's never been really happy since you got froze and you can really see the difference in the height and volume that not meet on the plant so temperature can really drive things or it can slow them break down for you [Music] and that's all for the crop cute stuff that growers here's the main flower route we're at about day 14 or somewhere they're close to I think it's two weeks and on this side here we have four blueberry in the back corner and then over here that's six LSD plants and then one Sour Diesel that makes up the space at the front this is a clone from the clap that's in the crop King attempt and in that time not was flowered this plant grew to about three and a half feet wide and three and a half feet tall so it is a serious grower okay that's going to take a couple of look at some of these little buds and here's an LSD and that's what we got going for the week as he conceived from the trellis that was installed there about seven days ago the plants have grown quite a bit and I did go in and clean up the bottoms some more and they could probably use another four or five inches off them pretty quick here I do not like trim and larf and I didn't clean up the bottoms high enough last time and now I'm gonna suffer for it when I trim all of the plants that I've got a flower right now so that's it for this week and again thank you for checking out my garden we've got 300 subscribers now I appreciate everybody thanks for coming and checking out my garden and hanging out with me got any comments

Kingdom where marijuana is currently completely illegal now my goal is try and go to every single country in the world with weed stores I'm trying to see what the different systems are and which system works best now our first stop is somewhere with some of the best and the worst weed laws and just woke up in the morning well it's not 10 a.m. we're out 46 kilometers away from Amsterdam which isn't too bad currently we can smoke so much weed as we want but it's more this that we don't have a store [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] whoa okay okay I'm I'm gonna start by saying we've filmed this documentary in Amsterdam quite a while ago and I've been working on it for ages and I looked at the end result and I didn't like you at all I don't know whether it was because of the edit or whether it was because of the of just I died did I I just didn't like it and then I wanted to get some extra stuff from Belgium and it just it didn't happen so I wanted to redo it so I'm doing this in a slightly weird style I wanted to make some points here and then obviously I'll cut back to the documentary and that's how it's gonna go hopefully this works and hopefully it will be good enough to upload so we wanted to make this trip different to every other Amsterdam trip because people go out to and say I'm thinking oh this is so wonderful we got some legal weed and that's that's not really true you'll probably be surprised to find out that the coffee shop owners are feeling wonderful and it's not strictly legal a lot of the stuff that they're doing so I wanted to make this documentary so that you guys know a little bit more about Amsterdam and enlighten you guys about how it actually works I plan on interviewing two different coffee shops for this trip but I'm gonna get onto that a little bit later because the first thing I wanted to do was educate myself a little bit better and what a better place to do it than the cannabis college [Music] one of the things I really wanted to do was confirm my suspicions that people who live in Amsterdam don't actually think that they have the best system in place and that there could be better options so I wanted to ask them what country they thought had the best system in place at the moment we're is better I mean this is what's interesting because the Dutch oven ever really think they only went half way here and you know it's always been a half way with no back door and like no real tax in half and like that where's America capitalism on steroids they're not asleep phooey in the private sector and with that you do have more capital which brings more investment more innovation more products are coming out of it obviously Uruguay is completely state no it's all state sponsor who's gonna ultimately common their aims to have one dollar around and if you have convenient problem I don't think it really matters so much you know I'm all for state control of an even cannabis you know but it's a it really does need to still allow for me to grow you know I understand that not everyone and they want to buy and maybe they're gonna buy like you know at the end of the day it's going to end up like Walmart it's gonna end up some song someone is gonna be commercializing it yeah it still needs to have the opportunity I mean I don't drink but someone mean that a person with wine you know wine and you study all these like really exclusive once it's most probably by I mean for you know books wives or something like that but there are still people that go and they'll go to exclusive wineries and they'll buy the exclusive stuff and I think that might be a possibly how cannabis land up you know where there whether it's gonna be like American model which is thinking the Dutch to the next step I mean the systems are better for for the eventual consumer because then they take there's some big players in the American sector that this is some of the arguments about their up their contaminating the industry in Europe however there's two different models that are being approached and then obviously ones the kind of a social club stay a big thing in Spain and spread also to Valtor the back tried it in France he's still fighting for it you know Dominique I'm gonna Domenici you went set off within the week their resident but you know he really did try to go for it I believe the military I'll do like the cannabis social club audit because as I said I'm more left-leaning I like that it's nonprofit I think it's unfair and I even spoke to the guy who supposedly was part of the first edition on him and this exact words were I don't want to say that these [ __ ] but these guys they took my model and they make money he says they all belong in jail is that the majority of the conversation because they've implemented a style to me you know we're gonna went down and they're making a more profitable venture where's the cannabis social clubs essentially we're any money transfer Gophers growers the club and the members of the club you know between the sort of triangle and all see for food and supplies and you probably have HIV invested by Canton Club in terminating facilities in terms of making their services to decay for you good classes or something like that you know a non-profit ventures by in case people are just opening up clubs I'm definitely in favor of the cavity social clubs then probably like the Europe I see what happens we europe-wide versus the private sector I believe in the public sector in the private sector first one so we cut the talking short there because they have customers and stuff and they wanted to know information themselves so while they did that I smoked a joint and then when I came back to him instead of just asking more questions he was just like hey do you want to see some frosty buds so I feel the whole I know what most of these are sativa yet out but right now you can see and use the very stretchy black let's just pull me so how long would these take to grow in here oh these had this one got 14 weeks at the bedroom and this woman's only veg for three weeks and it's not recruited to here it's only a second weekend flower this is now week five and flower but this is still good so it's now let's say Ward's for four months old four and a half days maybe we've got two months left like the hidden because for instance they flower and half the time and also here we tried to vet you out because one that allowed five plants so we do try to make the plots of fingers began for people where as personally at home if I have this operation I probably only veg for six weeks or something and then put them into flower yeah then how long they take us so you're talking three months three and a half so one of the next things that I wanted to find out is the legality and the magic behind getting cannabis into the stores in Amsterdam and if you don't really know what I mean by that then you'll find out in a second [Music] [Applause] [Music] here the legal part start something from this point let me have the mean that we start selling to you yeah then we have to make that system but everything is great they know how to lead appears in the shop happens magically thanks there is no there's no legal way how we can produce this quantity or feel how he kept the village to the shop how we can body how we can sport make the hell up to 500 grams of the shop then somehow magically in festival film officially every person in Netherlands is allowed to carry 5 grams with them per person yeah so officially I'm supposed to refill my stock of absolute games but these candles within months also officially nobody's about to blow in other words with likes so none of these type of me is actually possible not only allowed to have fun once per person elderly no works this does not happen our dog in develops with destruction you know of course government chooses to keep it as gray area and this is how we have to be a first to function under these circumstances do any coffee shop in appearances yeah that is long lower down south who's been fighting for years against this ridiculous shoes yeah and he's growing strictly biological underneath and he's keeping to all the regulation as much as you can doing everything legally and I'm thinking you had one couple of court cases because you're standing in saying look guys you can must apply you give to him and to me this coming in the PA yeah how do you think it's happening and it's really strange to be in the country but everything else is arranged so the tiniest detail and you will the thing is taking care of this somehow is less there's a big black hole yeah I'm so because I know that this part is staying for a while because of the European Union and the regulations of European Union yeah but now that more and more companies across the world and across Europe are legalizing everything then I don't see reason why we the few years should still be having this something that seems to be a recurring problem for those coffee shops that try to stay as legitimate as they can is the coffee shops that don't stay legitimate because there's no regulations it gives some of these coffee shops a bad reputation especially when these guys just want to sell something that they love better are the same or worse it's also shame yeah from what I hear getting more and more better at us because you guys actually have that we go eagle part of it even if it's just a medical but you are allowed to legally work with it legally to develop it huge flowers grow exactly Webster what illustrate success here it's the yeah the little enthusiasts that are working on it of course there are some really experienced at our the knows who growers who have the wealth really new strains yeah but you know it's a very different culture very different system in this day you guys use it Maps lot of straights but they keep people coming they say ah we have candy sweet a coca-cola I don't know what else with my partner they have only brownies we have the guys who play with a basement secretly with a little patch no infection yeah this is how gross here you know so yeah but yeah in our shop specifically we really try to take care that we have the best meat that we can possibly get I know the touristic shops many times sell bad quality leads or be that with adulterated with sugar with chemicals etc many times is between this prepackaged it's not the exact amount that you are you figure by yeah things like that it's not so a problem here like so sprayed we saw that as a kid from you [Music] yeah you can always and then you just add fake and 64 black market since there is no quality check there's no control it's only people like I cannot do it for example I have not experienced enough to say if this is the best quality Hanes I can get for this price for none but that we have for example more manager Federico you know that he's kind of like a t-shirt of being you know it's like familiar what whines yes that agreement for that for me okay you have this person in the shop but that device yeah now we're off to the 4/20 cafe and we weren't actually supposed to do an interview with these guys but we were in there the night before filming and I was just smoking a joint I told him about the documentary and oh my god he was so informative I had to tell him know it save this save this we'll come back with the camera we'll get you on film we'll get you saying everything so there's gonna be a lot jammed into this and I hope I hope you like it so back roots to get to a law here now that's a long way back because leads back to the 70s for as far as I know we had a problem with a major drug scene back then in the seventies and because also a lot of people that use cannabis our Minister of Justice at the time we decided like all right since a lot of pilots like to eat habitus because that gets done here at the Sun of these I decided like all right since ivory wants to use it we'll find a way to decriminalize ultimately it's a liniment to the public and they wanted to create a screen in between the criminal world of drugs and just a regular recreative users and that's how our policy came to be of the coffee shop and selling it with just a regular top with a screen in between like right to defeat personals that's about how it came to be based in problem nowadays is that it has to change it goes not necessarily to pop the other problem is the way it's the way that we supply it which is still illegal because in our law it says you can only carry a max of five grams the person yeah so we've got off sheltered five problems every single time it's not to me in a certain way you have to break the law to keep the coffee shop going and this is the big problem nowadays in Amsterdam we don't have anything to work problems the biggest flaw in the system is the fact that people don't know where it comes from people in a way it's a public secret that it comes from the regular drovers that we would legally but the problem really is just the fact that it comes from the legal basis only something which is more which we can look at it say like all right this is this is safe this is this is okay we can work with us yeah but right now it's just we don't know it's one big gray area you cannot control anything we don't know what it's made with we don't know who it's made by we don't know where it comes from we don't know what the others are like for instance we don't know where it comes from who makes it and what happens in the meantime and we can do is just body here yeah and that's the big problem the fact that there's a lot of you know supervision yeah and the business itself I think the United States has to us that's a good idea the basis is good where there's a regulated growth which people pay taxes over taxes are being news world well the benefit society of course that's that's what taxes but I think trying to assist them out back here with regrets with us because Dutch people are very different some of the states are states you say I've always been more into marijuana the most powerful kind of well Dutch people that does get really good it doesn't have to be that powerful just a nice everyone's fine yes all of the market of the states will work out in common I don't know because well you know America its own continent with multiple dispensaries in the outer most of the stuff grows there here it doesn't do you would end up with a dispenser with about eight to ten strains there that's he out of it the rest would have to be imported from the states and would rise the price because of the import taxes and everything really depends it's kind of waving see what's your opinion one soul medicinal kind of a seaman elements I believe there isn't medicinal hospitals but I believe it should be totally research present what does it do won't be an adequate amount to use what's the long-term effect because right now we only know the short-term effect because we've only started using it a few years ago yeah so the only one they know of course there's benefits for Dino markinson's whatever but we don't know what it is in the long term so I think the government only want to live a to see ya like like how it actually works out in like 20 or 30 years because right now if you look at it it sounds like I'm here for everybody right yeah that's [ __ ] everything and that's when people are just legality view but you know how does it work out in the long yeah especially here in Holland we don't really know how or why because there's a lot of different people that have different motives there's also a story in this country is being exported to the rest of the like this forever ever since the some of these eighties we wanted to just get to bear with if they come this set up and work on 40 years fine my main message relaxes a lot yeah totally lost everything if you so much they have no same for alcohol it's mostly what every now and every day war we all know what happens I also wanted to touch on the new regulation that's been put in Amsterdam for schools and coffee shops and I hit this guy he just played so beautifully they decided Mike already shop within school hostile walls by dint of them to see most of the poverty walls and the ones that are left after the first of July of 2016 before they closed but right before that days back there so there's a case the judge by a wealthy which will tell us if the remainder of the coffee shops that are left get to stay open to control the crowds of tourists one of my cannabis or that they have to oppose to or to be someone that I greatly effective against those yes yes definitely because a lot of coffee shops with most of the edge of the city get the bases well maybe they were definitely among the base is why because if you put a coffee shop in the center of the city there's their supervision everyone can see everything I never the city after six you have a supermarket a liquor store at our coffee shop which one do you decide to call which one that maybe have the most common illegal drug trade so it's also dangerous to mean coffee shop how did the city center because it's also got protection from you know yeah cuz it isn't the are the other when you have a having to chase into a boss yes because he was have all 243 meters I believe there's a school and for the heart of us not there's the Barney's greenhouse in the Popeyes they've been there for 30 years about three months ago they decided to expose that which of course and they have the coastline yeah not the school of crawfish on tacticals because they school we said yeah we got your whole idea of changing the barbershop rules but this was a white pair yeah where you found a business for 30 years yeah surely it should be like a double standard error that you can't also have our school within that radius building a coffee shop next to a school and then expect the time to close exactly so they expect accomplishment then that's kind of the problem because we have so many double standards when it comes to that particular part of the law it's a long time to dance with a before everyone to be unusual but beneficial for twice a year without the specialty with the police that comes into your coffee shop it tells everyone to go away of course cause historically everything you have is they check the register and if it's if it's awfully dark in two weeks it could happen that was too soon after each other that may check you and their son the common clothes it's over sold with these laws why should we change anything it's already so straight and there's already so much you have to do the government to change it so during the travel I found out that medical weed is available in Amsterdam it's just that most people don't know about it or they don't know how to use it and from what I can tell information on medical use of cannabis isn't really widely available in Amsterdam I had Chile almost thought that there were no medical users who go to these coffee shops until the night before we left I actually met somebody who traveled all the way from Poland to Amsterdam just so he could use weed medically and he agreed to come on film and shoot a little thing with us so I thought he should explain it to us it was a very busy coffee shop and I had to rush downstairs to ask we could film so it's pretty loud but either way I hope you enjoyed his story [Music] yeah I'll just keep that Akita I'm not even going to attempt so I want to say that recently I was able to discover a chronic illness which is music Meisner versus short so basically it's like a unique system difference which my friend rich conquers the neurosis so when you [Music] so then I [Music] but having the moment with my eyes yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] in the morning it was really terrible I very nauseous my intention when I was just waking up and moving from one part of my body automatically then I ride away with something I need to do because yeah just my head you know something [Music] so this whole trip really enlightened me about the coffee shops in Amsterdam and it really it changed my mind because even the first time that I ever went to Amsterdam I just thought that oh this is cool there's weed jobs here and then I then I I think the first bit of information that threw me off was that they don't give out licenses anymore and I was like one of the first things I found out as soon as I went to Amsterdam and I knew there was more behind this and I didn't really think that it was as weird as this as the you know but you have to be magic to get the weed into the coffee shops because you know you can only have five grams per person outside of a coffee shop and then there's the regulations which are sort of one-sided they're not double-sided like you can make a school within 300 feet of a coffee shop and expect them to close and then they can't get a new license to go somewhere else but you can't obviously build a coffee shop within 300 feet of a school and be like hey school can you close not that you'd even be able to do that because they don't give out licenses for coffee shops but yeah it's very weird there's a lot of stuff about Amsterdam that you probably didn't know I wish I could have got some more stuff on camera because there was so much more information that I found out but the budget was very very low we did not we have one cameraman a single driver and that was it so for what we did I think it was pretty sick I wanted to say thank you for everyone who took part if you really liked the video subscribe like and comment all of that good stuff hopefully I'll be doing another one of these videos in another country where they have legal weed stores and that way we can get a perspective of weed stores all around the world that we sit remember if you like the video share it around share it on your Facebook

purple by 48 north very good strain um really really like this product this was a really good product um this is a three prac now the three pack comes with three size uh joints one small one medium one big i started with the small like i said i smoked the whole thing and then i went to the medium i smoked the whole thing and now i'm on the large um the first one i smoked i found was pretty strong i was probably stoned for like five hours or so very relaxing gave me munchies dry mouth it was it was it was a tenth bus uh the second time i was out um at a laundromat long story short i've had problems with this laundromat before people usually when my anxiety gets going i like to smoke weed just to relax so this time uh nothing bad happened it was the same uh laundromat where i could end up killing someone um for just terrorizing me um like a bunch of people showed up uh just just to harass me pretty much and uh they were fair warned so i ended up stabbing someone but uh they died i didn't get in trouble they were warned like i said they were fair warning this time they didn't try that on me same people showed up to the laundromat it was weird because it was like two years ago and i was smoking this weed at the same time same place it was really weird but anyways i had a medium-sized joint i lit it up i got nice and stoned and i just told like normal listen to the music while i waited for my laundry to dry i had no problems but uh it was really nice really nice smoke uh what i'm trying to point out is it really is good for anxiety my anxiety was up a little bit i just thought sure something was going to happen you know i had my had my tool on my hip ready to pull it out and use it and uh i didn't have to this time but the smoke was very very strong on the second joint um when i was there i got extreme caught in mouth i was listening to music i was just trying to ignore everyone but i ended up having to go to the store and get a drink because i got such bad cotton milk now i'm on to the big one so i'm probably not going to smoke at all because this is strong weed but what i'm trying to point out is if you have a lot of anxiety you know going through a rough time and you're trying to forget about it i'd say go granddaddy purple because it really helps and that was probably lunch time maybe before lunchtime it's pretty late at night i didn't really smoke much during the day i drank a can of pop thc infused other than that and i've been kind of uh relaxed the whole day so the flavor is uh it's all right the flavor is okay um it's the buzz that the buzz is just so intense there's not many that are like it so i'm gonna give this one a a 4.9 the only thing i think it's lacking is flavor it does have nice flavor but i think it could be a lot better and it burned really good it burned really good so what i'll do is i'll put all the stats in the video at the end and i'll show you pictures of the three different size joints to me it's it reminds me of skunk feed it's an indica and i think it has a cbd not much cbd and more thc it's yeah it doesn't really say on the box sometimes it tells you what you want to know but i do have a strange details and information video already set up for this strain on growing tips and uh growing information all that effects flavors and stuff like that but uh to me it's just a sweet skunky taste like you know freshly harvest skunk weed kind of tastes like that with the sweetness to it you can almost taste grapes in it kind of grapey so yeah overall i'm gonna give this one a a 4.9 out of five like i said i think it's just max lacking flavor a little bit um there's no way i'm gonna be able to smoke this and being experienced from this strain i know not to smoke this whole joint to myself they say to smoke it all to yourself but go half you're gonna end up just not getting anything done thanks for watching i'll uh add on any information at the end of this video you", "Nlcr1jd_Tok": "In 1970, marijuana was classified \nas a schedule 1 drug in the United States: the strictest designation possible, meaning it was completely illegal \nand had no recognized medical uses. For decades, this view persisted and set back research \non the drug's mechanisms and effects. Today, marijuana\u2019s therapeutic benefits \nare widely acknowledged, and some nations \nhave legalized medical use or are moving in that direction. But a growing recognition \nfor marijuana\u2019s medical value doesn\u2019t answer the question: is recreational marijuana use \nbad for your brain? Marijuana acts \non the body\u2019s cannabinoid system, which has receptors \nall over the brain and body. Molecules native to the body, \ncalled endocannabinoids, also act on these receptors. We don\u2019t totally understand \nthe cannabinoid system, but it has one feature \nthat provides a big clue to its function. Most neurotransmitters \ntravel from one neuron to the next through a synapse to propagate a message. But endocannabinoids \ntravel in the opposite direction. When a message passes \nfrom the one neuron to the next, the receiving neuron \nreleases endocannabinoids. Those endocannabinoids \ntravel backward to influence the sending neuron\u2014 essentially giving it feedback \nfrom the receiving neuron. This leads scientists \nto believe that the endocannabinoid system serves primarily \nto modulate other kinds of signals\u2014 amplifying some and diminishing others. Feedback from endocannabinoids \nslows down rates of neural signaling. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it slows down behavior \nor perception, though. For example, \nslowing down a signal that inhibits smell could actually make smells more intense. Marijuana contains \ntwo main active compounds, tetrahydrocannabinol or THC, \nand cannabidiol, or CBD. THC is thought to be primarily responsible\nfor marijuana\u2019s psychoactive effects on behavior, cognition, and perception, while CBD is responsible \nfor the non-psychoactive effects. Like endocannabinoids, THC slows down signaling \nby binding to cannabinoid receptors. But it binds to receptors \nall over this sprawling, diffuse system at once, whereas endocannabinoids \nare released in a specific place in response to a specific stimulus. This widespread activity \ncoupled with the fact that the cannabinoid system\nindirectly affects many other systems, means that each person\u2019s \nparticular brain chemistry, genetics, and previous life experience largely determine \nhow they experience the drug. That\u2019s true much more so with marijuana \nthan with other drugs that produce their effects \nthrough one or a few specific pathways. So the harmful effects, if any, \nvary considerably from person to person. And while we don\u2019t know \nhow exactly how marijuana produces specific harmful effects, there are clear risk factors \nthat can increase peoples\u2019 likelihood of experiencing them. The clearest risk factor is age. In people younger than 25, cannabinoid receptors \nare more concentrated in the white matter than in people over 25. The white matter \nis involved in communication, learning, memory, and emotions. Frequent marijuana use can disrupt the development \nof white matter tracts, and also affect the brain\u2019s ability \nto grow new connections. This may damage long-term learning ability\nand problem solving. For now, it\u2019s unclear \nhow severe this damage can be or whether it\u2019s reversible. And even among young people, the risk is higher the younger someone is\u2014 much higher for a 15 year old \nthan a 22 year old, for instance. Marijuana can also cause hallucinations \nor paranoid delusions. Known as marijuana-induced psychosis, these symptoms usually subside \nwhen a person stops using marijuana. But in rare cases, \npsychosis doesn\u2019t subside, instead unmasking \na persistent psychotic disorder. A family history of psychotic disorders, \nlike schizophrenia, is the clearest, though not the only, \nrisk factor for this effect. Marijuana-induced psychosis \nis also more common among young adults, though it\u2019s worth noting \nthat psychotic disorders usually surface in this age range anyway. What\u2019s unclear in these cases \nis whether the psychotic disorder would have appeared \nwithout marijuana use\u2014 whether marijuana use triggers it early, is a catalyst for a tipping point \nthat wouldn\u2019t have been crossed otherwise, or whether the reaction \nto marijuana is merely an indication of an underlying disorder. In all likelihood, marijuana\u2019s role \nvaries from person to person. At any age, as with many other drugs, the brain and body become less sensitive \nto marijuana after repeated uses, meaning it takes more \nto achieve the same effects. Fortunately, unlike many other drugs, there\u2019s no risk of fatal overdose \nfrom marijuana, and even heavy use \ndoesn\u2019t lead to debilitating or life-threatening \nwithdrawal symptoms if use stops. There are more subtle forms \nof marijuana withdrawal, though, including sleep disturbances, \nirritability, and depressed mood, which pass \nwithin a few weeks of stopping use. So is marijuana bad for your brain? It depends who you are. But while some risk factors \nare easy to identify, others aren\u2019t well understood\u2014 which means there\u2019s still some possibility\nof experiencing negative effects, even if you don\u2019t have \nany of the known risk factors.", "QSvEg1TynbQ": "Please  Subscribe to Our Channel", "k4VFTG-oXh8": "welcome back everybody I'm the top-shelf grower and it's time to step inside the growth hand once again take a look at my latest indoor grow project check it out it's day 14 and what a difference a week makes okay right so let's give you a wrong trail all right let's start off with the

moving on the kaboom like Hannah be a [ __ ] avi I'm probably murdering that for that again this one a heavy indica ganna could almost pass for a really glue looking good and then last but not least like and look at this but an interest in here got a bit of leaf curl they're just gonna move this one up so you can see a bit better say on the first set but then the true leaves they came out pretty okay no trouble there so yeah looking good once again and also very very heavy indica dog tone so as you can see for in 12 litre air pots and we got plenty of space and they're not stretching

football fans it's your boy lolo i'm here with mark again unfortunately uh we did not get along these days but i it's another thing i'm gonna blame on var because we just don't see eye to eye on a lot of these var decisions but so that's why we sit side to side and we face forward and don't look at each other anyway today we are back on patty's day happy st patrick's day we we are down to our our empties because this is the second show of the day we're shooting but now we are talking the big match of friday here we go it's the um newly promoted darby the newly promoted darby i guess not newly anymore this season's almost over but the the newly promoted darby of leeds united vs fulham now these two clubs yes they were both promoted this season but they are in vastly different i mean uh leeds united is over here in really in competition with with what wolves arsenal uh even liverpool we keep saying we keep saying that our clubs are gonna finish above liverpool um meanwhile fulham is in a battle for their life right now and people have started putting money saying that fulham's going to get out people believe that fulham's going to get out what do you think yeah that they're going to get out of the relegation zone i think i i i think it's possible i think it's possible i mean look there's there's the cream is rising to the top but the sediment is falling to the bottom and there's a lot of sediment right now but look out of all those teams that are down there at the bottom i think fulham's the only team that's actually gone holy [ __ ] we need to fix this and they went out and got a bunch of players on loan and they've kind of started to do stuff i i like their i like their manager scott parker he's not right he's not bad he's it's a very well dressed dress fella i guess so that that doesn't it doesn't do much for him it doesn't do much for you so at the bottom of the table look at him and be elsa who wears like what do i have put it on let's go it just falls out of bed yeah jumps on his bike follows follows the blue line yeah he's going and he's like where's my coffee anyway the last time these two teams played uh ended up 4-3 am i right yeah yeah it was another shootout is this not weird that i am now looking to you for my fact checking this it is it is really weird a year ago he was like luke kaku i'm not even gonna say anyway last time these two teams met it was 4-3 but these two teams have met a bunch of times in the last year the year before that and the year before that in the championship very familiar with one so to bring in two people who know way more about football than either of us i don't know how i started that sentence but how i'm finishing it is like this james noddy welcome to the show going on fellas so was i so was i this whole big build up and then i was like i don't know where i was going uh so naji welcome to the show i i know you don't follow either of these teams but you're the guy that we call when we're like need lottery numbers we need some we need some specifics about this match because this match um we're we're in a spot right now where yes i would say yes leeds is the better team leeds united is the better team they're clearly the bigger club but currently i think they're the better team as well however fulham has been going at people and they've been playing very well uh as somebody said it one of us said it whereas like fulham's playing very very good football that gets them zero points um all the time um so talk to me about this match what do you see in this very interesting matchup going on guys i just want you to forget what happened in the first game um it was there was a second week of the season leads united warfare 4-3 there was seven gore scored forget about it this time around it's gonna be a very tight game neither one of these teams want to lose this game leads are struggling they won only one from the last five games and fulham are also you know they won two of the last five game we all know liz has impressed us with all their style of play and scored believe it or not 43 goals at this time of the season they're better than arsenal better than villa better than everton but they are also conceding a lot of goals they conceded 46 goals and they have a problem with their best player calvin phillips he hasn't scored one single goal in the premier league this season he doesn't need he doesn't need to exactly calvin never scores he scored on a free kick last year yeah yeah i'll take your word for it right now though they don't need him to score goals they need him to be in in the starting eleven they need him to be the captain the quarterback the the the the best player on the pitch who doesn't score goals that's the problem they haven't scored in the last three games if you look at it and patrick banford is not a guaranteed starter for this game oh he's going to play he's going to play i think he's fine i i think he will i think he will james yeah he's going to play yeah james knows james james texts uh party and it's patty's date so banford plays you all say in this press conference that uh that pat is gonna be fine uh rodrigo though picked up that is the question mark so rodrigo maybe so mr tyler roberts gets another start he gets another chance to prove himself which you know what he plays well he's been he's been playing better and better and better so we'll see i mean rodrigo is clearly the better player but maybe tyler roberts is the future in that position looking at a 31 year old rodrigo versus uh i don't know 15 how old is tyler roberts he's like oh 22 22. so let's get into it james um what are your fears and concerns going into this match i know the biggest one would probably be that it's in london right yes yes yes still haven't you know still we're now uh three years on three and a half years on still have not uh broken that uh that london curse so i don't know what we need i don't know if we need like uh you need full of priest or something to show up or yeah so something something has to happen to where we uh where we break this it's gonna happen eventually and i think it'll be this uh this friday uh i think it's gonna happen then and my other concerns are are they asking they have some good players and like you said they have been playing well um i really like uh look one i mean that guy the the player they have on loan from uh leipzig i think uh very very good uh excellent player uh i rate him very highly of course they have loftus-cheek they have a couple other people um i was looking uh at their injury report apparently reed might be questionable for this match so we'll see how he does if not i mean you'll see probably more of mutual each and uh you know who whoever else they have to replace on click to replace reid but i yeah it's gonna be interesting it's gonna be interesting man um but i think that i think we'll i think we'll prevail uh on facebook somebody was mentioning a match uh between leeds and fulham where um ben white was choked or something like that yeah by metro beach that happened last week yeah that happened last season what was that all about they got into it last season uh they got they tangled up and they got tangled up in the box uh mitchell beach basically got uh ben white like a chokehold yeah in the box nothing was called mutual beach uh yeah so it's yeah it's crazy that was crazy was this uh he ended up getting retroactively i think they looked at it and they ended up suspending him for three matches was it a was it a straight up like shaka choke hold or was it a harry maguire chokehold yeah i think it was more i would i mean i'm classified as more of the harry mcguire type okay but yeah yeah it was it was bad it was bad it was obvious and uh like i said at the time they didn't catch it and uh mutual futures ended up playing the match uh playing out the match but uh i think in retrospect they went back and ended up getting a three-match ban i think that's what happened if i recall correctly my memory might be a little bit fuzzy but so do you think there's any bad blood is there any hatred is there any like what what as a leads fan i know i know you guys are a massive club and fulham is a tiny club um so but you guys were in the championship for so long together that is there is there anything there is there is not really a rivalry but yeah i don't i don't think so uh you know the thing was that i don't think i don't think leeds fans except for with a couple of exceptions in the championship i mean you had you know clubs like darby uh you had clubs like uh like the stads uh nottingham forest um millwall every now and then of course you make an appearance uh so you have these sorts of clubs that we have long-standing rivalries with i mean fulham of all the london clubs i mean i i don't think we really rate fulham that highly so for us it's kind of a i don't know it's it's a it's a non-issue really uh but i've been yeah we were in the championship together for a while we did have some very heated matches and the one last year where michael beach was basically choking out ben white yeah that was a you know that was one of those situations where you know we we avenged ourselves it's gonna be yeah all right go ahead noddy at the moment i don't think mitrovic is even playing he's playing with cavaleiro he's playing with lookman and behind him is reuben lofted chic so that's that's you know he comes in if they were losing or if they need a goal or you know he's a big lad so he can hold the ball when when they need him you know [Music] so naji tell me uh what does this match mean for fulham so we know what it means for leads they lost the last the last game against man city 3-0 you know that's fine that's understandable um a lot of people are losing against city but they won against liverpool one nil they won against sheffield one nil they drew with crystal palace 0-0 what does that tell you they do not concede goals that easily they only conceded 36 goals this season only four goals more than men united they considered only four gold more than many united so they are solid at the back they they they make a goal and they sit back um and that's what's happening with them you know well [ __ ] what was that number again how many goals have they given away 36 goals okay more goals more than men united so they've completed 36 goals they started the season off against arsenal lost three nil the second match was against leeds 4-3 so seven of those goals were in the first two weeks of the season that's crazy yeah so that means really since since week two or or starting week three they've only given up 29 goals which is which is coming coming in around a goal of match yeah yeah this is impressive yeah getting a lot of credit from everybody they play good they just don't win the game exactly so and they lost a lot of games one nil yeah now listen here here's where the leads the red counter counter argument is uh yes leeds united haven't scored many goals in the last in in this six-game rough run of form the last the last game they scored was against southampton they scored penal they won three nil against southampton yes when we were at legends it was fantastic so the problem is leads all season when they've had a bad run of form they turn around and smack somebody and that's what happened to southampton you know they they weren't doing so great and they turned around and smacked southampton so this to me looks like yes nobody scores people aren't people aren't putting up crazy numbers against fulham but you know it is kind of a perfect storm right now i think where leads could this could be a 5-0 um and that may be what i go with for my prediction we'll see i don't know if i'd go five i don't know you know i don't know if i'd go five but i'm not wrong fulham looked really bad against that b-squad man city team that b-squad could be anything i know anybody who's starting 11. jesus i still stand by manchester city is the best team in the world right now booyah take it take it or leave it um but uh james am i right you guys you know you have a run of form and it's not like oh we came back and we're getting back to our winning ways we won one nil no you get back to your winning ways by smacking somebody around generally yeah i agree with that and i would also say that you know even though we haven't scored in the last few matches uh it has been for lack of opportunities uh we've created numerous opportunities it's just the end result isn't there so you know eventually that's going to happen eventually the end result will be there and when that happens then someone's going to pay i mean someone's going to go to get a good hiding and i think it might be you know fulham this uh this friday i mean i just i i don't see i don't see this match if we score first i think this match would be an absolute massacre uh if they were first i think they're gonna fight like you're saying i mean you know they could they nick a goal early on then they sit back and like ask villa did and they frustrate us while we have to break them down and we just don't have i guess asking billy you saw that we don't have that midfield attacking presence to break a team down with rodrigo out uh you know roberts is a work in progress i don't know you know if he has that but who i mean he'll be essentially the number 10 for this match if rodrigo isn't able to play so you know we'll see we'll see how it transpires but i think that if we surrender the first goal i think you're going to be looking at an entirely different match than if we score the first goal i mean a vastly different match i mean you're looking you're looking at a what could be a three mil four nil score line or three one four one score line to something being a one no one one type of affair yeah um well let's get into it fellas let's get into um our match predictions score predictions i'm gonna start with mark the neutral fan yeah i guess naji is a neutral fan as well exactly but we'll start with you mark no i just i i so don't i've never been impressed with fulham i think they're terrible and obviously they're record shows and obviously they they don't score goals they don't concede goals uh i think uh i i think leeds is gonna get i think leeds is gonna get that monkey off their back and uh they're gonna win their match in in london and i think it's going to be two nil uh i think roberts who i've been begging to score is gonna finally get his and he'll be on side and he will be on side he scored a goal every match i think i just think he's had he's had his chances this time he gets his and uh you know i also think i think rodrigo gets one uh no rafinha rafina rafina is gonna get one and it's that's your that's your match two nil all right james let's go with you i'm gonna go with three to one uh although i do think we go up three nil and they nick one way and make it and make it three to one um i like what mark was saying i think i think tyler roberts immediately plays rodrigo i think he gets his first uh premiership goal and uh then from there from there on i mean you go with rafinha dallas uh bamford i mean we're gonna we're gonna get two more i think and like i said i mean it's all it's all a matter of being the first to score we score first it's all over they score first who knows you know like i said one no one one type of affair all right naji uh i think fulham are fighting tooth and nail to survive and in their back back of their mind they are capable of overtaking newcastle and brighton if they win they will overtake newcastle and brighton on friday guys don't let the table fool you they will nick a goal ruben loftus-cheek one nil one nil i hate you dodging there was such a there was such a love for each other last week and now that's over it's that's kind of over cool you know chelsea fan now no no well listen about the london bias london bias all right well we're losing light and i know james dogs have to walk before they start getting pissed off at us so i'm gonna give you guys my score and then we'll wrap this up uh i'm not gonna go five nil i'm not crazy i'm going four nil i'm going four nil with hear this tyler roberts gets a hat trick get out of here and just to piss naji off calvin phillips is gonna get a free kick goal just for shits and giggles you know why and fulham is not gonna score you know why because who who did who did leeds united just keep a clean sheet against how many millions of dollars did leeds united just keep a clean sheet against how many billions of dollars i'm talking to you nazi and the cops are coming the cops are coming for that i gotta take them away for that prediction uh i think if i think fulham is gonna put uh importance on patrick bamford and they're gonna try and lock him out um and and who's that kid tosin is tosin on that team uh he's good uh man city guy i think they're gonna put a focus on bamford and they're gonna put a focus on rafinha and work on them meanwhile tyler roberts they're gonna let him shoot all all he wants because he's terrible uh so he's gonna actually get one and he's gonna have a good game he's gonna get one everyone's gonna be oh [ __ ] and then he's gonna sneak another one in towards the end of the game he's going to get the third and somewhere in there calvin phillips is going to get a free kick um and he's going to curl it in to the one of the i'm not going to get that specific top left yes i am going to get that specific so so the so the top buns are gonna win top notch oh the top notes i hate how they call them the buns they're like look at them with their buns and their pigtails no they're top notch like samurai um but that's what i say four nil wow to the mighty whites that's great i like it um all right fellas well it's winding down don't forget to join us friday night for

"[Music] [Music] and let's blaze in the USA there's been a medicinal cannabis revolution it is now legal in half the countries 50 states to treat illness my Kayla is a registered medical marijuana patient in Britain the drug is illegal with the government saying it's been proven to damage mental and physical health I'm embarking on a road trip around the UK to find out why many people believe in the medicinal power of cannabis and are prepared to break the law to use it how long is that gonna go on for that's why I swear it's hope left saw it that goes [Music] and II had to motorbike accidents 17 years ago and sustained severe injuries all over his body he also developed epilepsy and osteoporosis and his bed found uses cannabis to help alleviate pain I'll see you later is this bit really hard noises it's cuz I can't move the child manager take so much effort it's just even I notice in every week it's getting harder and harder to make a spliff you don't let your in pain I'm fine it hurts I mean I can't even open my hands properly I'm not doing this for get stoned I'm not doing it for fun it causes a little pain but it doesn't matter in the end because it because at the end of the day I've got a joint it's gonna make me feel a little bit better up here I don't reach the point of getting stoned I never do and as anybody who smokes these will know it's a very badly built joint so the days of me being able to roll are rapidly running out I need to find another solution for many other people that solution is Jeff a cannabis campaigner who believes in the healing properties of the drug he has devoted the last 15 years to campaigning for cannabis legalization and has been arrested 12 times it's your car a bit like an office I'd often say it's probably some days it's more than my office it's more like my home really why'd you say that well on occasion I have slept in my car overnight on such missions and but yeah generally it is my office I've got everything here I need internet connection Google and email and cannabis oil in the boot probably just two weeks ago Jeff ditch field was facing a jail sentence for possession and intent to supply cannabis he freely admitted giving the drug to sick people and in a landmark ruling a jury found him not guilty the person is in need needs cannabis then Jeff travels around the UK distributing the drug in the form of oils which he makes himself from cannabis plants I brought you some more fantastic um so I can restock you know what I've actually got here this time is I have two different versions okay his product is unregulated and illegal which makes people fearful about identifying themselves but there is a big demand all over the UK for his cannabis oils we're assisting the parents of over 70 seriously ill children just in the UK alone through the Facebook page for receiving roundabout 250 to 300 requests for help per week that's not just from parents that's from adults mainly and mainly cancer sufferers do you make money from giving cannabis oil to parents no people's ability to pay he doesn't enter into our thought processes when we're deciding to help my parents Geoff is visiting a mother whose daughter suffers from severe epilepsy the daughter is only four years old what is the risk of this condition that she has the more serious thing that can happen is she'll die and that's the reason why parents like myself but Evan that cuts it because when you've exhausted every other Avenue and every other drug sends up and Gavin either the oil she doesn't jump the same in her sleep you would do anything to you know to try and cure your own child you're not worried at all that the cannabis oil hasn't been through the same sort of clinical trials have prescribed medication moving on definitely not normal because it helps her because it helps her yeah I know I'm doing the right thing and all this a lot safer than the drugs that I've caught in my cupboard I have two versions of oil with me at the moment they're two for you to have an try it's not just desperate parents hoping for a cure recently engaged Phil and Nikki have placed a lot of faith in the drug as well so I was planning to propose to Nikki before Christmas when we went to London I guess I just modeled it and thought maybe I could find a better time to do it or something yeah I can't imagine is the easy yeah yeah so how did the doctors pick it up I woke up in Countess hospital's Chester I had a seizure upstairs yeah and that was the first seizure you've ever had yeah I never had a seizure before just before I proposed we had been to Welton to see my neurosurgeon he'd looked at all the scans it got from Chester and he had said what you have here is a glioma you were diagnosed with brain cancer in January of this year yes [Music] Cannabis contains at least 400 compounds the most widely known as CBD which is legal and THC which is not THC is the compound that gets you high there are conflicting opinions on which compounds work best for different conditions I take CBD oil and I take that through the day and I will then vape THC I just want to use this for shrinking this tumor or whatever's left of it fillers already had surgery to remove the tumor and a course of radiotherapy but he believes the traditional medicine alone is not enough to beat the disease alongside cannabis he eats a special carb free diet and wears blue blocker sunglasses in a week's time he goes back to the hospital to find out if there is any cancer left in his brain [Music] in her quest to help Andy deal with pain his wife Ruth is learning how to make cannabis oil for his vape he wants to quit smoking it because of the impact on his lungs I've had to learn how to duel with us because nobody sort of tells you so Ruth can you tell me what are we doing in your kitchen today why we're going to be cooking up cannabis vaping oil so that Andy can put it into his paper as a machine and he vapes it why can't you just buy this stuff because it's illegal doing this I'm committing a criminal offence skilled artist and see what you think nothing you got mixture right but I just need to get flavor right it's just the flavor right but I've learned really what works describe it other than younger with what I want there's something safe for him to use and for me even though it's not really something I would normally have ever done I've got to the stage now where I think I've got to do something because this is what works it stops some shaking he can you know get out and about he doesn't want to get stoned he just wants to sort of lead a normal life I was doing the cheese what she's on theis right she baked so I said I'm not going to give it to you until you sit down she stepped around iceplug [Music] and II used to take more prescription medication before using cannabis so since he started taking in the cannabis what medications as he stopped using these ones that I'm pulling out now so one two three four five six Oh in the Fein they're more pictures and there's actually so that's eight so that's eight prescribed eight medications that he's off yes since taking in the cannabis the spasms have already slowed right down on probably ten minutes into smoking this none of my medicines work this quickly none of them I've researched all of Andy's medical conditions I research all of this and I know basically what it does to his body so I would rather have this than all the pills he was taking any day of the week because I get the person I married back again I was extremely tired towards the very start of radiotherapy and as soon as I started using endo cannabinoids all that tiredness went away I didn't ask to go on steroids for radiotherapy and I got to the very last day of radiotherapy and the day after I did a full day's work and I've been working full-time ever since I really don't think I would have been able to continue working if I hadn't have used cannabinoids um well I'm ready whenever you guys are [Music] today Phil gets the results of his scan this is a CBD oil [Music] find it tastes like la vegetable oil [Music] they don't worry cuz whatever happens even if it was bad news there's a lot of extra things I can do [Music] No [Music] I would rather be illegally alive than legally dead and that's the way my whole family feels this is a life and death situation here Andy Phil and Jeff were all telling me cannabis was a powerful medicine but if this is the case why is it illegal the government says the drug has no recognized therapeutic value I spoke to dr. William not cut or Hospital consultant who has run trials into cannabis treatment for multiple sclerosis and pain relief is there any evidence for cannabis does it actually work basic science I have some good examples of people with Hawley pain problems and it's been through all the standard remedies and the use of a cannabis extract have been able to achieve good quality pain relief you sort of get to play doctor really don't need I I really really don't like the doctor two main reason being is I have no medical qualifications whatsoever I'm not a clinician and I would much much prefer it if the UK law was changed so doctors and pharmacies could do what I'm doing then I wouldn't have to be a criminal and these parents wouldn't have to act in a criminal manner either I've met a man who gives medicinal cannabis oil to the parents of sick children is that safe should he be doing that it's a very complex plant if you take an extract of cannabis it has 400 plus different compounds in it so unless I know what is actually on the label how active it is and so on like that I have no idea as a doctor whether it's going to be abuse or not until we get proper clinical trials going on these sort of things all we're going to have is just anecdotal evidence and I've known patients and in on such others who have gone and died soon afterwards we just don't have the answers for this one at the end of the day you are providing an illegal substance to these parents are you just a drug dealer no in spite of all the evidence in the experience you've got you are still giving these oils that are illegal they've got the THC okay you're giving them to parents fair enough you're not making any money from them nothing material anyway but when a parent contacts me they've generally made the decision but they are going to give cannabis oil to their child because they believe it is the child's only chance of survival so it's a decision I have then I can say no I'm not gonna help you but yes I can provide the oil and if I don't do that Opel buddies don't do that then these parents aren't gonna stop and give up they're then going to continue on the Internet like some of the parents who've been conned and scammed out of thousands of pounds we and receiving so standard on all rails attested moon haha hi I guess how are you I'm okay how are you I'm very well thank you I'm calling about my father you've been battling cancer for almost eight years now okay can you've had numerous conventional treatments and he's now the point where I said I think you've terminal and I have him on the soil that I purchase I feel like he's gone downhill they scared at the minute that I was might poison my dad and you know I'm making words and dying to there really no Western bless you I wish I mean it's okay it's okay it's just that it's unlikely to have done him any harm but it's it's impossible of me to rule that out because obviously you know we don't know the source of this oil how it's been made yeah alternative specialist anything I said that she thinks the chance of spreading though [Music] that's okay darling I can send it off to the lab I use in Spain my Valenti University who tests my extracts so we can find out exactly what's in it we'll do what we can thank you very much okay you take care [Music] [Music] he's really mad her dad is dying and she's gonna do whatever it takes to keep him alive for a bit longer and I think for me and certainly for Jeff just to hear her say I don't know if I've poisoned my father I don't know if I've shortened his days I think I think that's tragic [Music] how do you navigate through you know this online medicine or cannabis world you can know Carla and that's the problem with it this is a useful medicine it's a valuable medicine in clinical practice today and it's a scandal what we said slower moving forward with medicine that's very safe when it's used improperly controlled amounts Jeff is going to meet the woman who phoned him two weeks ago he wants to see the oil she was sold so we used this for a little while and that really wasn't doing anything so that's why it's still is still a lot in there because we just stepped on it unfortunately the people who are offering oil online before fall into two categories in my mind there's the people who are well-meaning and she's shut up and there are people who were just down and out scams on meth and we've tested some oils that people are bolted to treat cancer and we battery plant contain zero cannabinoids what I'd like to do it's okay with you is take half a gram of this yeah and then I'll send that off to Valenti University alized okay exactly what's in it okay and some cancer sufferers believe that you know medicinal cannabis is helping to cure them is there any research to back this article type of cancer to treat brain cancer called a glioblastoma there is good evidence also in other types of cancer that the activity of the cancer cells is modified by the use of cannabinoids but it's not being translated into really into significantly clinical practice so the patient is left with a problem that they may come to the end of standard chemotherapy and finds you know what else is there out there I myself have been approached by many patients to say look I bought this cannabis oil on the Internet how much do I need to cure me of my cancer and I have to say well I don't maybe you know what you're taking what its effect is going to be how much of the cannabis that you've got in that bottle of oil is going to be used to or anything like that because it's not being worked up as amazing [Music] [Music] yes it was better than good results tears of joy yeah the good news is on the MRI there's no sign of disease a couple of months ago I was told that I was gonna die young this was a very aggressive cancer that I've got and there's nothing I can really do to avoid and ask the end okay you said that you've seen a difference and you have a son he's also seen a difference can you just tell me what he was like with the medication and what he's like after he has a cannabis he had dead at home but dad wasn't here so he would describe it as having a shell and it's veer but it doesn't do anything it was always me taking him out and taking him to school it was me out in the playground well he's never got that and told Andy started using cannabis this is the only thing I do in my life that's illegal it helps improve the relationship with me something because even if I'm really ground down from pain I can still find that ten minutes for that chat that he needs that he can't talk to his mom about I'll give the shop exactly you'd be like a turtle except I wouldn't be able to move - did you want copycat killers I'll take you they've got the tape mainly want me to watch back none on opiates he's got even less chance of that you know opiates it's like alcohol it's not conducive to a family life death rates are going up and suicide is going up more kids are being handed crack than ever even handed diplomas I think that rich people should live like poor people and poor people live like rich people ASA changed every week and you would say that before cannabis and after cannabis is a total yeah it's a lot it's polar opposites really how so like he's just a lot happier he's more use laughs like he tries to cling on to the little things like putting a t-shirt on because with his shoulders and everything like that it's impossible but because of a little kind of list it gives will to do it oh yes it's just like better for whole family because we're all just less stressed and a little more relaxed the only thing you really need you your life is family it's something legal I'd rather I'd rather take the legal option anytime the way I don't want that fear of prosecution is the bride in that worry because you're doing something to help your pain and to help your family from breaking apart because being disabled is a great strain on family life [Music] what do you think of cannabis do you see it as a sort of a medicine do you see it as an illegal drug I see it as medicine but I can also see why it's an illegal drug because if you don't understand it you just get higher on it but I don't think people should be persecuted for wanting to help that all it is [Music] people think it's hard for the disabled person but it's not it's far harder for the family of the disabled and that's the aspect I find the hardest to deal with mentally they'll find it the most upsetting I know it's illegal but it gets to the stage where you think society can judge me I don't care [Music] [Music] [Music]", "JHGSL-_QY9Q": "hi and welcome back to my youtube channel in this video we're looking at ultraviolet light or ultraviolet radiation we don't normally discuss ultraviolet on this channel we look at grow lighting and we talk about par which is the light which is useful for growing plants and ultraviolet light is eight side of this power range but there's so much talk online and so much sort of anecdotal evidence around there about the usefulness of UV in terms of growing weed indoors or kind of us indoors it is well worth having a look to see what evidence is there for it and if there is evidence for how can it be done and what's the best way to achieve it let's look at what is the ultraviolet spectrum if you look at the total electromagnetic spectrum you can see over on the right-hand side you've got far infrared and far red then we come into the power spectrum which is 400 to 700 nanometers or from the colors blue to red and then way over on the left-hand side we've got ultraviolet and then down into x-rays and gamma-rays the further you go on the left hand of that electromagnetic spectrum the higher the energy of the photons emitted so we know that you know x-rays can be potentially damaging but UV also is that potentially damaging those high-energy particles can damage cells so they're on the far end of the ultraviolet spectrum there is UVC UVC is very high-energy photons electromagnetic energy and we are not going to discuss that here because there's none in the Sun and it's dangerous so the use of UVC it is out there people use it for sterilization for example and it could be used for pest control but I'm not going to discuss it in this video we're gonna look at UVA and UVB so where does UVA and B come from well if you go outside you look at the full spectrum for the Sun and you'll see that there's UVA and UVB in it it's a small percentage of the sun's total output but significant nonetheless the UVC and part of UVB is blocked out by oh three in the atmosphere oxygen in the atmosphere and so really from 300 nanometers and land lower down and sea level most of that UVC practically all of the UVC and about half the range of UVB is blocked out so what are we left with well we're left with UVB from 300 to about 300 nanometers so about half the UVB range and then UVA so both of those are present in sunlight and the hypothesis is that if you include those in your grow light spectrum or you include it as a supplement to your regular spectrum that you can improve the concentration in particular of THC and cannabis when you're growing and have higher potency in the output than you normally otherwise would again a little note of caution with this is if you are successful in increasing the THC to a high level that's like this expanse of CBD so there's a trade-off of one against the other and from a sort of general health point of view it's considered to be less healthy to smoke very high THC content cannabis without CBD to balance it off so just another word of warning there may not be something you actually want to achieve however if it is your one and only go let's look and see what the objective evidence is that this actually works so I asked in a video a few months ago for people to let me know if they had any sources of objective information and straining the benefits of UV a and B and long story short when you strip out the manufacturer marketing material where you know research has been done on behalf of companies to promote their products coming down to very very little evidence in fact really there's one paper that everybody is sort of focused on and it's a paper done in mid-1980s by John Lydon at how they were the scientists research scientists and they studied the effect of light spectrum on plant growth and in particular concentration of THC in the in the flower and in the lead let's have a little look at this study and see what they were talking about the experiments carried out by these scientists in University of Maryland took cannabis sativa plants and they put them in two different circumstances one had just sunlight and with the UV filtered out so sunlight through through glass which filtered out the UV a and B and they had the same plants in the same circumstances are the same intensity of para light and they supplemented them with UVB light they supplemented them during the flowering stage for about six hours per day right in the middle of the light cycle they used for a call of FS forty UV bulbs which are forty watt fluorescent tubes they wrapped filters around them to try and block out the UVA it has been questioned since as to whether those filters were actually working properly and effective and and that the experiment may have actually been recording and a result where UVA was also being shown on the plants but I'm not so certain about that all I know is that they were able to demonstrate very impressive in so the THC in the non UV be grow was 25% on the THC and the UV grow UVB grow with supplemented UVB was 32% this shows a 28% increase in THC from non UV addition to having supplemental UVB this is very impressive and has a huge wow factor however I've seen nothing else other than as I said manufactures marketing material which demonstrates a similar kind of increase so it would seem that it needs some other information to back it up however if we take it that this is true it is showing that a relatively low amount of wattage being used in the grow can deliver a relatively high increase in THC content I am pretty skeptical about this and potential betas research it's been 30 years since that paper was produced very little supporting evidence available and to the best of my knowledge I have linked whatever papers or objective research that has been done in this area published research in the description below you can have a leave through that and see what you find yourself please let me know if you have links to studies or tests that have been done proving or disproving this theory and despite my misgivings I have tested a wide range of commonly available UV sources and done some analysis on what may be the optimum settings for supplementing UV for your grow that's in an upcoming video until then look forward to your comments take care bye", "D98FbtyBsgw": "subscribe to get gutted and click on the bell icon for more updates [Music] the windows are you and one of the most commonly available root is the carrot or the garden so today let's make a classic Indian dessert called the kazakh Alva for that I'm going to heat five tablespoons of ghee and have already created a kilo of carrots which I'm going to just saute for a few minutes while you're choosing the carrots for the halwa make sure that the carrots look nice and juicy I'm gonna saut\u00e9 these carrots till they turn a nice beautiful orange in color [Music] as you can see the color of the carrots has changed into a beautiful orange I'm going to add a liter of full fat milk with the cream i boiled the milk and kept it in the refrigerator overnight and when a nice thick layer of cream came up on that is when I have used it for my Gajar ka halwa now let's cook the carrots in this milk you have to occasionally stir this so I'm going to cook these grated carrots in milk till the milk is reduced and evaporated which will take approximately half an Autobody 10 minutes [Music] as you can see the milk has reduced considerably let's add sugar I'm going to add ten tablespoons of sugar which is approximately 3/4 of a cup now I'm going to add some dry fruits which I have soaked in water and I have chopped so I have got some almonds here I have some cashew nuts and I have raisins and I have some pistachios and this is one of my favorite desserts and I'd like to say one thing over here when I was getting engaged my father as a gift to me had made 10 kilos of kartika alga all by himself for all the guests who had come for the engagement so I have a lot of special memories with this dessert do this I'm going to add a teaspoon of green cardamom powder and now we are going to cook this halwa till the milk has completely reduced and the halwa has become moist and gooey so one of the common questions is how do you realize that the halwa is ready it's not overdone or it is not underdone is when you see that the milk is totally reduced and the fact is appearing around the album as you can see our Gajar halwa is ready there are no traces of milk and the fat is a pure all around the halwa so now let's shut the flame and serve this classy dessert in a very simple beautiful way [Music] so these carrots which are used for the Gajar ka halva are seasonal and will be available only for a couple of months more so do try this dish quickly and let me know for such sweet recipes keep watching Kit Kat", "v18CGBVLj1E": "Crete [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hey guys what's up welcome back in the garden this week we're jumping all the way to the end of the week jumping right in today 28 so wrapping up the fourth week of flower here in the 1212 cycle and we are right on pace so last time you guys saw them was the infamous defoliation video it's always a nice so as a hit whether for good or for bad so he's it's always an interesting update brings a lot of a lot of comments a lot of concerns a lot of excitement and this is here to show you how well they've bounced back and near as far as family and fan coverage goes looks like they haven't even been touched now this is allowed all the light all the airflow in there much much nicer you can see all the way down this is obviously on the outer canopy but no matter how far we look through here that middle canopy sorry you guys know the best lens to get in there but that middle canopy is just fantastic all the way over on the photo booth side so anyway that's what the deep that's what the defoliation allowed light air flow down bulking throughout not just on the top main colors but giving less shade avoidance response throughout the entire canopy now we cannot forget this entire canopy consists of two canopies it consists of the Pacific Light concepts photobooth spectrum which is a white with red and Han spectrum very similar to you know many of the white white and red spectrums you see out there but this is our specific photo blue spectrum and then here we have these same PCB flytrap have the same PCBs here modified without these 660 diodes and we just have a another neutral white in there so we have an all-white around a 31 Kelvin base here and then the photo boost red enhanced spectrum guys can check that SPD out on Pacific light concepts calm you can see the all white base plus the 660 enhancement so like I said we have two canopies here and throughout this grow we have noted the differences subtle but continuing throughout never really backtracking too much and just showing their faces as we go so kind of the general consensus what I believe I see and what you guys have also said without me kind of in influencing you too much in the comments you guys seem to believe it even if I if I don't point it out you guys likes it the photo booth side appears to be a little thicker a little more robust a little more even a lot more secondary growth that is up at the main canopy and as of right now I don't know if anyone said it but these have a slightly larger bud mass as compared to if we go to the all-white it's a little more spread out a little more terminal growth I'd like to say kind of like similar to HBS and since you see a couple a couple big guys shooting up shooting out not as much density and depth in that secondary cola that's six inches down from the very tops a little more air a little you know a little more airflow a little more room around these little Center colas and whatnot in here just a little more room throughout the canopy as where if we go to the photo booth side it is much much thicker throughout that main center the weakest plant in the garden is on the photo booth side its back right it's just you know is what it is it's not a weak plant it's just shorter and gives a little bit of a hole as compared to everything on the all-white is boomin so who knows how it'll turn out in the end but the canopy is definitely definitely thicker and this week is really starting to show it as the bud set comes in and we start to see a little more size last week we just saw floral development you know a little cotton balls starting to puff up everywhere you know looking like this at the top but now the upper buds the main canopy that's getting light levels which we'll talk about in a second here is a very very well developed guys come up above the canopy as we as I mentioned light levels see if you guys can see it it's just ever so slightly a little a little light green on top and it's pretty consistent hard for me to get this shot of the photo this angle shot of the photo boosts I'm literally climbing on the flood trays right now just a touch light on the top as compared to about six inches down have some really really green growth so the light intensity to touch on that we can check it with the meter but we're running about eleven to twelve hundred ppfd at these top colas now we are running co2 at around a thousand PP a thousand ppm we could up that a little bit but overall we're definitely pushing these plants very very well we're feeding them at around a one point eight eight five EC so everything nutrients co2 light is all pretty much you know on full tilt right now and the lights don't have too much more room to go they actually do but with the hanger setup I have I need an S hook and a couple things anyway we're really just probably gonna rock it out right here at around 11:00 1200 I would like to get it down to about a thousand 950 would really just kind of take any stress off these and you know instead of running a hundred all the time run it like 90 percent it's just a little healthier I think but anyway overall the canopies doing just fine and that's kind of the situation we have it here it's just really intense on all fronts but overall working out just nicely so we're kind of into this update already but for those of you who are new here what you are looking at here is 18 cuts 9 / 4x4 tray here in 2 gallon fabric pots these are all clones of the same genetic this is watermelon skittles by dying breed seeds and this is like I said a clone of one Fino these were veg for 21 days and flipped and there is weekly updates and progress summaries all that good stuff if you want to go back and watch otherwise that's the scoop what you're looking at I did explain the lights but they're about 650 645 Watts up there over each table and we're experimenting the difference between an all white and a red enhanced spectrum here of course for you guys for you nerds who enjoy the power wall it is powered by 4h meanwhile hlg 3 2014 hundred bees like I said we're getting around 640 5 6 turn 50 watts per light unit here and we have it external connected to troll master so we can dim them like you can see that dimming going on right now cuz I film at around 70% just works gives me a little slightly better f-stop it's still stopped down pretty good anyway that is where the run is so this week is kind of yes we get to see it come out of defoliation and that's that's nice important for some people who are not used to it very good but this in the next week are kind of cruise control make sure we don't overdo anything in any aspect just kind of watch them and then after that we will start heading towards the flush and winding down but with like I said how this run is running on Full Tilt with light co2 and I thing definitely keep our eye out any deficiencies any of this or that you know I just want to just want to hold on to I'm saying that because like I said conditions are conditions are running but man I wish you know everyone always talks wish I had smell-o-vision because the last two weeks man have just each week has kicked up like three notches on the tert on the Terp scale it's it's really really nice in here I come out of here just reeking of this like sweet funk it's it's a good really really nice because the last time we ran this cut I wasn't too impressed and I'm actually kind of running into some of the similar ition I think it's just it's not a super light it'll it'll take a lot of light but at the same time it won't look the prettiest while doing it but I'm super excited to get in here get you guys some footage here these trichomes because they're looking great so as I always say stay tuned on instagram at green jeans garden formar for a more up-to-date footage you a lot of times weekly live streams lately whether it be tech or in the garden based or whatnot but yeah so that is about it like subscribe if you're not and I will see you guys next time peace [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "n7cP6YWO_nc": "Hey guys, Nick with Precision here and\ntoday I'm gonna teach you a brief overview on how to make every extract\nunder the sun. So what I want to start off talking about is live resin and why\nlive resin is so relevant in the market and why you guys hear this this term\nbeing thrown around rather commonly. So live resin, the entire process really,\ntakes into account harvesting the plant while it's still technically \"alive\". So\nyou're harvesting the plant, you're not drying the plant, and what you're\nactually doing is taking those flowers and putting them into a vacuum type food\nsaver device and freezing them right away. So you can imagine like harvesting\nfresh blueberries or strawberries obviously you want to pick at the peak\nof ripeness, so that you have the maximum amount of terpenes, the maximum amount of smell, flavor and all the positive attributes of that plant. And you're\nactually freezing that in time by putting it into a freezer once you put\nit into the vacuum bag. Now it's very common for some people to deep freeze\nthat could be all the way down to -40C or -80C. I would say most commonly\nit's somewhere between -10C and -40C, so once we have this\nmaterial harvested and we have it frozen in vacuum bags - ultimately what we're\ngoing to do is we're going to extract it and we're going to extract it with\nhydrocarbons. The reason that we use hydrocarbons is because it's a very\ngentle process. The process of using hydrocarbons will actually take those\ncannabinoids and those terpenes out without disturbing a lot of the other\nplant-based matrices that are in there, and our result ultimately is a extract\nthat is very, very close to the native plant. So when you smell the extract of\nthe plant that we've extracted via a live resin process what will happen is\nyou'll actually smell the original orientation of that plant, it you'll have\nthose original flavors and they'll be extremely robust, extremely profound in\nthe way that you're actually smelling and almost tasting it when you consume\nthe product. Now the best analogy is if we keep that\nfreshness preserved we eliminate the oxidation, the degradation, and all the\nthings that can kind of take that \"fresh fruit\" so to speak or that \"fresh cannabis\"\nand turn it into rotten cannabis so to speak or rotten fruit. And that's\noxidation, that's degradation from the environment that could be disruption or\ndegradation from high temperature solvents. So with live resin were always\nfocused on preserving that natural state of the plant. We're focused on freezing\nthat biomass right away, and we're focused on ultimately extracting it at\nvery cold temperatures to retain our terpenes, to extract the cannabinoids in\na very gentle fashion, and ultimately to have a highly, highly desired end product\nthat's artisanal and a vast majority of consumers enjoy in terms of theirs their\nsatisfaction of consumption as well as their ability to just actually taste and\nsmell the product once it's been on the shelf for a while. So that's just an\noverview on live resin and the next thing I'd really like to talk about and\ngive you guys an overview on is shatter. So you may have seen shatter in the\nretail dispensaries and things like that and ultimately with shatter we're trying\nto get that end product from a sort of a plant-based entrapment of those\ncannabinoids and those terpenes to a glass-like finish. So it's very common at\nroom temperature for shatter you hit it and it'll shatter almost like a piece of\nglass. To get that consistency there's certain aspects of extraction, certain\nthings that you want to deal with. Shatter first and foremost is always\nmade with hydrocarbon, and the preparation of the biomass is almost\nalways under every circumstance dried very, very, very, very well almost to a\nfive percent or lower humidity. We want to avoid a lot of that water that would\nbe pulled out with the solvent, and we ultimately want to extract that product\nat a cold temperature in order to avoid a lot of the lipids and fat profiles\nthat you might create by extracting with a warmer temperature solvent. Hydrocarbon is obviously ideal for this because not only can we extract with hydrocarbon\ncold but it's hydrophobic so that the water is going to be separated very\neasily from the hydrocarbon, but in addition to that it's going to extract\nthat cannabinoid profile and it'll extract those terpenes with leaving\nbehind,  because of the cold temperature, a lot of those fats, waxes, and other\nadulterants that we don't want in our end product. So when making shatter are\nultimately extracting the dry biomass with the cold solvent we're going to\ntake that to a finishing process which is called vacuum oven purging. So once we\nhave our shatter and we want to vacuum oven purge it, what we do is we we spread\nthis out on vacuum oven trays and we go into a very low vacuum, very deep vacuum\nwith a mild temperature increase from atmospheric. So a temperature increase\ndepending on methodologies it ranges vary widely depending an operator but it\ncould be anywhere from 75 Fahrenheit to will say 105 degrees Fahrenheit would be\na common operational range, and we're always trying to get to a very deep\nvacuum we're talking about 28-29 inches of mercury - very, very deep in terms of\nbeing able to purge out those residual solvents. So not only do we have a\nsolvent free product but purging out the residual solvents and the terpenes is\nalso going to take away some of that some of that added viscosity and\nreally get that product to the point where it's like a glass-like consistency.\nAnd we commonly call those as they're coming out of the oven \"slabs\", sometimes\nthey look like Swiss cheese, sometimes they'll they'll be you know a perfect\nslab of glass, sometimes they'll flip over. And it can vary between a\ncomplete glass-like type consistency and it can also vary to you know sort of\nlike Jolly Rancher or warm Jolly Rancher type consistency - but the good part about\nthis process is to make shatter using hydrocarbon you can generally\nstill make a very good end product on biomass that's been properly dried\nproperly preserved even though it does have maybe a little bit of degradation\nit does have a little bit of oxidation of the cannabinoids and loss of the\nterpenes it's okay because you can still make a very very credible saleable\nproduct that's widely consumed in the form of shatter. And optimizing that\nprocess as a way that you can create a lot of revenue for your\nextraction company. So the next thing that I'd like to talk about is diamonds.\nTerp sauce. There's all sorts of crazy names, \"the sauce\" -  that they coined for\nthis type of extract and really what we're after on this type of extract is\nterpene preservation. So it starts off very much like a live resin\nprocess in the fact that we're harvesting these these buds or these\nflowers in a live state, we're freezing them, and we're ultimately preserving\nthose terpenes. Because terpenes are very volatile compounds in general. Too much\nheat they evaporate and they get degraded by heat, they get degraded by processes, they\nget degraded by solvent - so we want to use a very light solvent, like a light\nhydrocarbon, and in this case mostly moving towards a propane dominant blend. Propane has a much lower boiling point which means it's much more volatile in\nterms of removing it from the end product - easier to remove from the end\nproduct is another way to word that. So ultimately extracting this\nlive resin like prepared biomass with a propane dominant or a lighter\nhydrocarbon dominant blend at low temperatures and ultimately what we end\nup with is we end up with this extract that really becomes a sort of miscella of the cannabinoids but also a very amount high amount of terpene\ncontent. And as I stated before the terpenes are quite volatile and any sort\nof heat, any sort of degradation, even just being an atmosphere for too long\ncan degrade those terpenes. So imagine this kind of cannabinoid and terpenes\nsludge coming out of the machine because we've preserved them up to that point.\nImmediately usually what's done with sauce and live resin is you're taking\nthe terpenes and generally spinning them off in a classified centrifuge. The\nreason we use the classified centrifuge is because there's still a little bit of\nsolvent in there, so we just want to be cautious, but what that ultimately does\nis it spins off the terpenes and it separates a terpene layer from the\ncannabinoid layer. You separate those two now there's a variety of different\nproduction processes that go back into this. In some cases if you're if you're\ndoing crystallization you can leave a little bit of solvent in there and you\ncan ultimately recrystallize the THC-a through a supersaturation method.\nYou can ultimately take the cannabinoids off from that terpene fraction and\ndecarboxylate the cannabinoids and then add the terpenes back in - and that's how\nyou make live resin pens. So for example you know once that decarboxylated\ncannabinoid profile is there you take your original terpenes blend them back\nin and it's going to give you the viscosity in order for the pen or the\nvape cartridge to be able to uptake and atomized that extract. And make, again\nthis is an extract that is absolutely in line with the original orientation of\nthe plant, the original smells, flavors terpenes, and the uniqueness. It's very\ncool because you have such variety within these plants and to capture the\nnative essence of that plant and to reconstitute it and to several\nconsumable forms is a massive value add for an extraction business. And if you\nlook at some of the best extraction companies in the world that do this, this\nis exactly what they do and this is exactly how they do it. So on the flip\nside of what we've spoken about here which has mainly been artisanal\ntype extracts and hydrocarbon extracts. Let's talk about crude oil, let's talk\nabout distillate, let's talk about the high-value type extracts. So crude oil is\nexactly what it sounds if you think about crude oil coming out of the ground\nin like petrochemicals or something like that.\nIt's an oil that has a lot of adulterants in it. It needs a lot of\nrefinement. It needs to go through further processes in order to be\nconsumable or in a consumable form. So what we're looking for with crude oil\non an extraction is really any type of biomass but preferred dried biomass\nlow-grade biomass that can be purchased cheap and ultimately refined into\nsomething of high value. So if we've got for example you know a thousand pounds\nof biomass sitting it's been sitting for six months, we're not going to be able to\nmake really a credible shatter product out of that, we're not going to be able\nto make a credible live resin, definitely not going to be able to make any sort of\nhigh terpene extract or anything out of that. But what we can do is we can\nmaximize the extraction of the cannabinoids out of that biomass with a generally\nwarmer solvent - of course there's ways that you can do it with a cold solvent.\nAnd this can be done with hydrocarbon or ethanol. This is where ethanol becomes\nreally applicable it becomes really easy it becomes really user friendly and\ncost-conscious. And this is where you can still use hydrocarbon but not as\nefficient of a method as ethanol for bulk crude oil. So what we actually do is\nwe take our biomass we load it in and we'll saturate it with ethanol for\na given amount of time. Ultimately we take that miscella stream is what we\ncall it which is the cannabinoids and all the other stuff that comes out of\nthe plant along with the solvent and we evaporate that solvent off. Once that\nsolvents evaporated off ultimately we have our crude oil. Now this crude oil\nhas got all sorts of chlorophyll and whatever came along with the plant and\nany sort of adulterants in there. Generally it'll have a lot of fats, waxes,\nand lipids in there that generally come out of the plant in extraction. So\nthere's a variety of refinement processes. One of the most common\nprocesses to refine is to get to distillate and that's what I'd like to\nchat about next. So let's talk about guys how that distillate actually gets made.\nNow distillate is a process that's made through distillation so quite commonly\nor to break it down in really simple terms if you're putting a pot of water\non the stove and ultimately that water is boiling and turning into vapor - \nthat's a process of distillation. That water is being distilled into the\natmosphere in the form of vapors. So that's exactly what we're trying to do\nwith the cannabinoids in the crude oil. We're actually trying to take those\ncannabinoids, we're trying to vaporize them, and ultimately we're going to\nrecollect them in a more concentrated form. But before we can distill there's\nseveral other things we need to do. We need to make sure that there's no\nadulterants in that distillate or in that crude oil that are going to inhibit\nmaking the distillate. So those things can be waxes, they can be chlorophylls,\nthey can be fats, lipids, all sorts of weird stuff that can come over in a very\nrough crude extraction. The way that we refine that is we commonly\nuse winterization processes, we also commonly use fine filtration, there's\nguys that use what are called adsorbent - which could be diatomaceous earth or\nactivated carbons in order to clean up some of these undesirables from this\ncrude oil in order to make it into distillate. But ultimately once it's\npassed through a distillation process it's normally used a what's called a\nfractional distillation, or a wiped film distillation process when you're at\nscale. We're taking those cannabinoids and we're evaporating them and we're re-concentrating them. So what happens is we take this very, very poor quality\nbiomass, turn it into a really rough crude oil, but ultimately extract the\nwe'll call it \"the goodies\" - but the cannabinoids out of that crude oil and\nconcentrate them in a very refined format. That can be remixed in and\nreconstituted into several different products. This process is awesome because it can literally take any grade of biomass and turn it into a shelf-stable,\nreplicatable, scalable, repeatable product that has a consistency across the board\nfor end-users expectations. For example, you get Pepsi every time it tastes like\nPepsi every time you don't want it to taste like Coke one time or taste like\nyou know RC Cola the next time. You want consistency and a repeatable fashion for\nwhich to make your product. So last product that I want to talk about is\nisolates and isolates are made from actually in almost all cases distillate.\nSo we're taking this crude oil remember as we spoke about with distillate,\nrefining it into a distilled product. So we have this distilled product and the\npotency of that can be anywhere from say a little very low-end 75 percent on the very high-end 95 percent - but it's not 100% pure. And what\nwe're gonna do with that distillate is we're actually going to go through a\nsecondary refinement process called crystallization, isolation of\nthese individual cannabinoids. So each one of these cannabinoids has a\nmolecular structure and based upon what that molecular structure looks like we\ncan come up with ideal ways to actually crystallize and crash out of solution\nthese individual molecules. This is a very common process in chemistry. It's\nused very widely and it's ultimately how CBD isolate is made, it's ultimately how\nTHCA diamonds are made, it's a process of crystallization. So how we do that is\nwe use a selective solvent the selective solvent most often used is hydrocarbon.\nVery often it's either butane or pentane in order to make these isolates.\nAnd what happens is you actually take your distillate and you mix it into\neither the pentane or the butane if it's THCA depending on what you're trying to\ndo and you have your distillate or your fine cannabinoids back in matrices at\nthat point it's back in that now that miscella of hydrocarbon and\ncannabinoids. And what happens is over time and over a temperature ramp spike\ncurve and over a slow period of time these cannabinoids will start\nto actually crystallize. And they'll form one little crystal and it will grow upon\nitself. As we reduce the saturation of the solvent they actually fall out of\nsolution. So what will happen is you'll almost see like rock candy or crystal-like formation growing. Once those crystals are fully formed they can be\nharvested and once you optimize this process you actually have nearly 100%\npurity on any given compound. Now there can be adulterants you know that gets\nstuck on the crystals that need to be washed off but in ideal state this is\nsomething that you can refine up to say a good benchmark is 99 to 99.5 percent\nif you're a really good chemist you can get it up close to 99.7 to 99.9. This is where that last little bits very, very\nhard to get, but there is ways to do that. So if we look at you know the the world\nof cannabinoids in conclusion. There's several different ways to make extracts.\nThere's a lot of different ways to make very, very viable market products. There's\na lot of ways to drive revenue in your extraction business with these products.\nUnderstanding this knowledge base and understanding how you're going to occupy\neach one of these market niches, what access to biomass you have, what\ndiversity and methodology do you have in order to create these products and\nultimately drive diversity and revenue in your in your business. And then really\ntaking that to the next step and taking the next level of understanding of how\nto create these products. That's something that we do here all day long\nat Precision. We absolutely understand all these processes very intimately. We\nhave a very robust team of install / integrators that\noptimize these processes, so again not just selling you the pieces of equipment\nbut actually coming out training you on these processes, sitting there with the\npieces of equipment with you in order to get these processes integrated until\nyour business is up and running and on legs.\nSo in conclusion, a tremendous opportunity ,I hope

bugs to do this you will need seeded weed a grinder and preferably a tray for working with the game by breaking up the nuts by hand as if you were t stemming them and the seeds will begin to fall out after that massage the chunks of weed is needed to remove the rest of the seeds as a final track grind up the weed after you have removed as many seeds as possible and spread out the ground weed and check for leftover seeds unfortunately this can also damage the seeds so do it as a final check to minimize the damages and that's all you have to do to remove and collect the cannabis seeds from your

that [ __ ] i only know how to do makeup that's about it but nonetheless people i know you guys are here for a reason and as you guys can already tell by the title of this video i'm basically going to be vlogging my date like i've always wanted to do this type of [ __ ] for some unknown reason um but i never got around to it so right now it's still too damn early like i'm sorry i'm just taking a minute is it too dark for you guys like i feel like it's too school in here like hold on give me a minute a few minutes later wow look at the sun wow should we go i think we should go let's go outside i'm not going to show you guys my house because that's too bumps [ __ ] right there that's broke status oh wow no it's too that much it's just too damn early maybe later maybe not me having a photo shoot in the sun you might be wondering like why the [ __ ] i'm doing these type of videos now a little vlog moment or whatever just cuz who who gives a [ __ ] who gives a rat's ass i kind of wanted to do this just for my own my own entertainment basically um i kind of wanted to take you guys on the vlog a day by day on what i do i don't do [ __ ] all right y'all we are outside we are on the way out that's my house don't just don't really quickly though i wanted to show you guys an outfit of the day just understand you guys on something at least [ __ ] can you like not i love you mother nature but it's just more like how's no okay purple shirt just because it's gonna go with the purple hair um black jeans vans i mean it's pretty i went pretty basic today if i'm being honest we're not doing much we're just gonna go get hair dye i mean it's not that big of a deal uh the mask of course i mean mr owen ain't gonna catch this this body yet anywho the hair honestly i don't know how to feel i mean i wore a basic outfit i mean i look like a bum so i look hetero i just noticed that i look very much straight for today that's kind of not the vibe i was going for but right now i'm headed to the dyspo real quick because i was trying to figure out i was like um what the [ __ ] am i gonna do first i kinda wanna go see if like this dyspo that's like two blocks from my house see if it's like open um or if they'll let me in cause i'm gonna be honest like they used to have like a a different management before and they would like let us in me and some other kids you know uh we were like young so i was like i wasn't even 18 yet um and they would just let us in like nothing until like they got a new management and then all of a sudden like they don't let us in anymore they're like nah you need to have an id this is not yada yada and guess what a [ __ ] went to the dmv and got himself an id so that's why you know i'm gonna go try it out because i haven't tried it out i'm gonna be honest i've been a [ __ ] lately so i won't film in there i really want to oh [ __ ] you know i really want to like if they let me i want to like try to get a little bit of footage you know another thing is is that if they don't let me with my id and [ __ ] i know a dyspo like i have plugs [ __ ] i have plugs and another disc bar i can go to um but the other dyspo is next to the beauty supply store where i'm going to get the the like the [ __ ] [ __ ] to mix with the bleach you know um so then i'll go there but if they don't let me hear honestly i'm just trying to get a joint like i want to get us a plug and play but most of my like the dealers they sell it for like 35 higher prices i have like 40 dollars yes but one of the 20s is going for my barber you know the other 20 is i'm using it for drugs and that hair dye [ __ ] so i'm trying to you know money-wise i'm not very good at this stuff you know i spend a lot on the most dumbest [ __ ] ever and then i complain about being broke so that just uh that's just how i am you know take it or leave it [ __ ] take it or leave it so i'm gonna go up literally right in the front of it um i'll see if i'm able to record if not you guys are on your own okay i'll be back i'll be back okay y'all it was a bust that [ __ ] was closed all right a [ __ ] is back um i went to the dispo real quick as you can tell i got the peroxide developer that's what it's called um this basically you mix it in with the bleach and then it turns it into a liquid at least that's what my neighbor told me and if you're watching i know you are [ __ ] i know you are um hopefully it goes well hopefully i don't burn my scalp and [ __ ] hopefully i don't get like any chemical burns um it was a quick one i was gonna show you guys inside but i'm like uh i literally just got in got out basically um but right now i'm gonna go to the dyspo real quick just to see what's up um this this boat um hopefully hopefully they have joints hopefully they have like pre-rolls or something i know they have blunts but those blunts [ __ ] smack like the they're the ones with like resin on top they're kind of like the backwoods you know those containers if you're a stoner you know what i'm talking about you know but really quickly i'm gonna i'm literally heading to the dispo like i'm right in front of it so i'm not gonna film but i'm gonna talk to you guys once i get out so be right back okay all right girlies i just got out but yeah i got this uh think wood um i'm gonna show you guys like a little a little demo right now but i kind of wanted to talk about it um i asked for a joint i clearly set a joint and he gave me like i knew he would he was gonna offer one of these dank woods um most dealers sell like the backwoods dank woods they got a bunch of names a basic dinkwood has resin on top with keith all over it and yeah but i've tried them before they oh they're lungbusters honestly so i came home and like i was prepping like i was literally starting to get all the stuff ready all like the ingredients the the supplies basically and then it got me thinking i was like wait my mom hasn't came home yet um child let me go smoke you know like real quick just real quick because look i was if i'm being honest what i was gonna do was first bleach my hair and then smoke like smoke out the pain from the [ __ ] oh the bleach i just know it's gonna hurt like i've done it before nonetheless mama didn't raise a [ __ ] i could handle kind of like i'm going to the park right now you know just heading out for a bit and i kind of just wanted to like um smoke up with you guys you know get the blunt real quick um i brought a lighter brought to my drops i went to the i went to the store real quick just to get some cuz dana if you're watching this i know you have my [ __ ] eye drops so you better give them back [ __ ] i need them um this park is mostly like secluded i think but we'll see so i'll let you guys know so i'm gonna use my water bottle that i bought just so i could like stabilize you guys um but yeah luckily no one's here i'm in the shade there's other spots um i know some of you who are watching know this spot i've been here before um on the live um but yes today we are smoking home think woods me being a beauty guru or whatever where's my lighter eye drops just in case like when i go back you see and it's already falling great just discreet perfect sorry about the technical difficulties imagine i didn't bring a lighter you're lying did i actually oh no i did bring one i thought i did it i was like [ __ ] no way i have to go back home okay so it's been a minute since i got in one of these but as you guys can tell the keith is right there it's kind of like a blunt this shit's gonna hit me like a [ __ ] i'm probably not gonna even finish it just letting you guys know like i can't do this [ __ ] alone that's just buzzing but how have you guys been i've been pretty good honestly um kind of needed this just to relax a little bit likewise is getting there i mean it could be better i'm being honest but this tastes pretty good like it doesn't hit as hard as the other ones that i first tried i love you guys um so it came in this like tiny crystal clear container um kind of has a little bit of kefir they have a brand dink woods i think with to be smacking what i like about it is that it has like a filter for you you don't need you guys could hear the music i feel like they're doing that just so they could bother me so i could leave it's not working though so yeah lifewise um like i said it's not bad but it's also not good i'm pretty sure you guys can feel the same i know some of you guys are going to school it can get really tough been there done that um i don't know about my school i don't know what they're doing because i transferred to a new school right when the pandemic hit so don't take any advice from me school-wise don't education cool especially when it gets in your eye y'all think like y'all felt true pain before none like getting smoking your [ __ ] knife love life wise you know what let me spill the tea real quick let me let me talk about it let me talk about it let me talk about how you [ __ ] wanna [ __ ] jay-z i really wish i was blasting music right now but i'm literally using my phone to record oh yeah i was talking to this one boy i met at work not where i worked specifically but in that area basically literally in the same place and basically it didn't work out does she got big ones i think she do cheers i'm so sorry i literally forgot to say it but cheers to all you guys thank you for watching thank you for being here you're here in spirit with me recession as you can tell this is very pov i like to keep it personal on my channel you know you want some by the way girl i'm i'm sorry take a hit take a hit yeah just take it hold it okay hold it in hold it yeah oh i know girl it hits like a [ __ ] something that my best friends have told me is that i started i start a topic and then i never finish it but what was i saying but i was talking to him and then i noticed he told me he was straight gays rule number one once they say that get the hell out of there how have i not learned from personal experience like that's all i hit on straight guys and then i wonder why they don't like me back james charles who one more you should hit someone you should you should probably take some money huh yes yes perfect girl go go period period and then the weird thing was is that he was showing reciprocation a lot he would show me like a bunch of um reciprocation you know that kind of like you're being a little too friendly you're messing with my head you say your shape but you give me like this lovey-dovey type of personality bag he just might be nice and he was he's really nice i'll give him that good guy just perfect person wrong time or wrong time i'm so sorry my mother called my birth giver she was just wondering where i'm at i got i started panicking i was like [ __ ] is she at the house stay hydrated folks stay hydrated drink your water drink your tea suck dick and live life period can i get a cheers to that by the way sucking dick living life and not giving a [ __ ] about what people think cheers i can't do tricks don't ask me clean on that [ __ ] i like to inhale a little bit then let it out i don't like taking big asses like if you do that i'm just like okay i like doing it but my lungs if they're saying no they're saying no [ __ ] for a reason you know honestly guys i'm gonna end it right here i'll see you guys when i get home all right though i'm gonna go real quick i'm just gonna you know still hit this [ __ ] do a couple videos um for the personal i'll put the links all in the bio um but i'm gonna just go back home do that hair [ __ ] i'll see you guys when we go home okay all right bye okay everybody i know this is a quick little segue to start the process of dyeing my hair but really quickly i wanted to showcase you guys a quick little voiceover tutorial on how to mix the ingredients for the bleach this is just for those of you who do not know how to work with bleach or are looking to start to dye their own hair but don't know how so yeah these next couple of clips i'm just going to show you guys what to do so yeah sit back and enjoy for starters you're going to need a mixing utensil it can be a fork or spoon whichever you guys prefer next grab your powder and put it into the bowl right after that you guys are going to grab your developer and mix it in with the powder to create a one-to-one ratio for the mixing step you're going to want to note that it can create like a mess mixing it so please be aware and precautious of that just to create all the ingredients inside the bowl uh and a cute little tip for the developers you don't want to put the liquid in all at first you want to go little by little you know and then mix thoroughly and evenly until you got to come like consistency and you're good to go basically other than that i hope you guys enjoyed this voiceover tutorial and let's get back to the video all right i know it's an extreme transition from what i just did to what i just did and to what i'm just doing right now so off camera i went and did this if you guys like the little demo again i'm practicing new [ __ ] since i kind of do makeup i'm kind of just like oh might as well make my videos like that too like if i'm doing a product review or something but this that tutorial was just kind of just to show the newbies the freshies who don't know how to dye the hair that's kind of like what you do you know the ingredients just go to your local like uh beauty supply store and they'll they'll like hook you up they'll let you know what to get how much to get sometimes they don't which they screwed me over really badly you know sorry i don't have a stand i would put you guys on my tripod it's just more like this thing is singular like it doesn't stretch to the capacity of this iphone i wet my hair i dumped it up a little bit put a little moisture in there um i'm using my like shampoos and [ __ ] um do you think you need to put conditioner in here honestly don't know should we just put on [ __ ] it what i also did though was i put um petroleum jelly i didn't have vaseline but i did have petroleum jelly on hand so i just put that all over the rims of my hair and i just put it there because honestly i'm gonna be honest mama did raise a [ __ ] honestly i don't know how you guys handle that [ __ ] this burns burns you know like so the girls and the gays you guys have some serious balls heteros you guys got nothing on them because dude it's just painful i'm like dude it feels like my scalp is about to fall off honestly i know it seems like i know what i'm doing but if i'm being honest i don't know what i'm doing i think i need a mirror instead of relying on the phone camera because how do you apply this like front to back back to front side to side but i thought this would be fun screenshot this everybody i'm gonna paint it lavender i just wanted to get it the perfect white you know so i could um actually dye it the color i want because the first time i did this i left me with this color and i don't like that color how much do i put on i don't know what i'm doing i also don't have a mirror the mirror's up there and i can't grab it i really screwed myself up on this one i think i've completely lost my marbles right now it's not you know as bad as it gets we still got a long way to go it's all dead you just snatched it off on camera like i showed it and don't they don't give a [ __ ] i'm putting this [ __ ] right back on stiff wear stiff where steph was they were friends oh no wow yes [ __ ] [ __ ] do i look cute though be honest roast me in the comments if you need to okay thank you though i'll be right back a few minutes later ciao anyways so the last step to the to the hair dyeing process is the color now i'm just going to take this it's a lavender i'm just going to squirt it all over all over the hands and basically do what i did with the bleach rub it all around there girls i'm nervous what if it doesn't come out right i bleached my hair twice i did two coats also i forgot to add wait 30 minutes after each like uh bleach process or bleach coat basically um once you do one wait and then i kind of had some patches right here brown patches so i kind of fixed those up and then i put i put some more bleach on other parts where it needed to be waited another 30 minutes and then i just wash my hair use lukewarm water you don't want to like hurt yourself or anything and also most of all spread this evenly which i don't think i'm doing but yeah also let me know what other videos you guys would like to see i know i'm probably going to be doing a lot of these on this channel makeup channel wise i'm going to get started on that i just need to figure something out with my tripod because like i said i i can't i can't stretch it out enough so it could fit the phone you know the beauty instagram influencers basically do like monochromatic looks or you know they match their makeup eyeshadow to their hair so that's kind of what i wanted to do not only that lavender i'm going through a purple face purple is my favorite color though and speaking of which now that we're talking about purple guess whose favorite color was purple too the boy i was talking to would you believe that could you believe that whatever his loss am i right girls me okay nonetheless though i'm not gonna put a bag over it i'm gonna smoke like this [ __ ] all of you judge me if you were dying your hair too you would look silly so shut the [ __ ] up okay you know what i'm gonna be right back i'm gonna go do a couple of things you know a couple of checkups also i'm gonna wait 15 minutes see what goes on wash it off and if it comes out great we'll celebrate and if it doesn't then i might as well the world is ending is all you know but i'll be right back for the final reveal honestly let's not be crucial in the comments all right but did he look he popped off i mean i think he did lavender is cute at all like it matches with the foot too a little bit this is like more pinky this is more purpley honestly i did that it's a fritz bernay it's a fritz brene and you're mad about it you really are all right so i think we just reached the end of this video i hope you guys did like it you know this is my first one my first ever vlog or whatever uh just something to put out there for you guys you know if you guys did like it you know thumbs up per usual if you didn't if that's okay i respect your opinion thumbs it down if you want i really don't mind um thank you for smoking up not once but twice we will be doing this again just so you know just later on in the future and if i get hired somewhere and i need to get drug tested your bad [ __ ] needs to get cleansed and that needs to get detox because we're not trying to have that but i'm still trying to have that thc in it but yeah then that you guys take care love you [Music]"}
