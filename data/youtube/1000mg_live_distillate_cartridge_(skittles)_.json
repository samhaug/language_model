you", "7KDXXoIL28Y": "[Music] what's going on guys my name is Jeff Austin is popcorn welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if you're new make sure you subscribe got a lot of different videos on the left and today we're gonna be talking about this little guy this is a live resin cartridge the strain is purple haze and it's from Prime Wellness this is the craziest card I've ever seen you guys it is not like a normal live resin cartridge when I posted this on my snapchat last night there was a lot of confusion from people that didn't know exactly what this is this is a live present our trajactory at this is pure live resin when you look close up to it you can actually see little PACA rocks in there like little diamonds floating around it's basically like the concentrate sugar in a cartridge like nice flavorful intense clouds every time it really tastes like a DAB and it also feels like it's AB you do not need to keep cheeping on this like you do some cartridges it goes a long way since the little rocks in there are so small they should be able to just be consumed right through those coils there might be a little bit left over smoking on my Paquito from cloud products I really like this battery it's a magnetic over ring bottom so you just screw a little overhang into your battery plug it in and you hit it I really just like how small and discreet it is I've had a lot of lab resin cartridges before that say liquid lab resin on it and it's like actually liquid it looks like the same consistency as a normal car but this is totally different this is like something I've never had before when it comes to price it wasn't too bad now when you buy a cartridge no matter what it's gonna be expensive when you're buying it legally to restore there's just a hefty price on in my state cards go for forty to seventy dollars and this one was fifty five so it's actually right in the middle of price I know a lot of people are like shocked at how much I pay for weed sometimes it is extensive but honestly like you have to pay for freedom and I'm an estate that just recently introduced the medical bill so the fact that I'm allowed to legally buy this and consume it like I'll pay the extra money I'm happy to help you'll [ __ ] for those of you who don't know what live resin is it's basically just a concentrate that has an extremely high terpene profile the way that it get to that terpene profile is from the way the plant is cured typically when weed is grown they cut it then they cure it in a room and then let it dry and then they process it with live resin once it's cut they instantly freeze it then that fresh version product gets processed and turned into live resin since the weeds frozen the turkeying profiles are way higher think about freezing a banana if you kept it frozen it wouldn't ripen in the freezer it would stay how it is when you froze it so in that drying and curing process there is some flavor lost in cannabis should still taste good but it just tastes better with live resin because it has all the terpenes yet try different battery freshen unboxing got a break it you know this is the poquito push it's basically the big brother of the poquito definitely larger but what's cool about this one it probably conceals your cartridge so there it's like what is this portable charger what the [ __ ] no it's my cartridge if you can watch my videos for a while you know I love my Terps which is why I'll address is definitely my favorite form of concentrate I just love the flavor you get it really can't be lied resin except if you're talking rosin which is super crazy I've heard of some people doing like rosin karts but they are not cheap and like I wouldn't even consider buying one at the price that they are but these lab resin karts are the [ __ ] move I really like how convenient cartridges are which is why I still buy them but I have to make sure they're high quality ones and I just wish that there was a higher standard for cartridges as a whole like I don't get why it's that rare for me to find sugar and a cartridge like I feel like that should be somewhat easy and common of people to do like ethos incarnate oh yeah the beginners that I didn't order crazy how many people were telling me to like take back this cartridge and like this isn't a normal cartridge and that should be concerned as I'm describing it as a languorous and cartridge I feel like a lot of people just thought it was distillate and honestly guys if your discipline cartridge looks like this do not smoke black resin can have a file you look to it but this look and not like they're two totally different concentrates honestly guys just to warn you no matter what company or buying it from no matter what brand it is if you're buying it this little cartridge it's probably shitty even if it's fire like every company I've ever heard of puts their bottom shelf product in their distillate no matter what it's going to be there trim and they're like worst looking nuts the reason for that is all this tool it looks the same when it process the matter what the butt looks like it's clear and tastes like nothing so then companies add terpenes if you're lucky to the distillate to make it taste better for your enjoyment sometimes they don't even have real turf there's so many random ghetto [ __ ] that's been added into cartridges and that's why all these people are dying because of shitty black-market cartridges like dude these hits are so amazing it tastes so good I hate to be the person to say that even the most top-shelf brands of distillate are shitty but ultimately they are even when I'm smoking into the cartridge I know it's the company's bottom to your product if they added into Italy it just has to be there's no way around it every company has trim every company has dirt product that they have and the company's mentality because they're trying to make money is let's turn it into distillate they like actually hit you in the chest like a bat and you have to really think of breath like and it hits you definitely going through this cart look at a little diamonds whoo if you ever get the opportunity to get ladders and cartridges that actually have some live resin in it go for it there's actually like a lot of liquid ladders and cartridges but this is even better this is like a whole nother step ahead I would love that this became the new standard for cartridges just because it's not only a pleasurable experience for like the casual smoker that likes cartridges but it's also an enjoyable experience for the avid smoker that since all the time because I know a lot of people that just like won't even hit cartridges because they just don't feel like they get them high the people that have known that there was something wrong with these that were just like no I'm not even hitting that because so many people have had shitty cartridges they hand me a cartridge and they're like yeah what do you think and it's just moving faster than a lava lamp and they're just like bro what did what are you doing or you just see the tank big box and they're like no it's legit my boy told me I'm like yeah you hit that over there I'll follow the ambulance for you if you got something out in this video hope you guys are smoking with net let me know what videos you want to see in the future make sure you follow me on snapchat and Instagram and everywhere else to see everything I'm doing I'm only supposed to on snapchat whatever new stuff I get first so especially if you live in PA and you want to see like what new fire stuff is around I'm on it like a [ __ ] so follow me on snapchat pipe underscore porn I'm at popcorn pretty much everywhere else things are about half the car that's impressive pitting about a hit that took I've been cheeping on this all day too I'm gonna be going up to Colorado next week so I'm gonna see how the lab present cartridges are out there pronounced you got a bunch of videos lined up around them out there let me know if there's anything you want to see probably me doing mostly vlogs so keep posting I can't do it I've never really been the big trick guy I'm gonna get to look cool to do babe tricks and I feel like I don't really look cool enough that just feel like a little nerd out there blowing little starfish or whatever they do thank you so much for watching click like if you enjoyed make sure you subscribe my name is Jeff peace [Music]", "eTb7xVO_FE0": "what's going on it's Little Miss cannabis and this is my part two video on how to use the pure distillate in the syringe form so earlier I told you how to warm it up to loosen up the consistency so it was easier to use so when it's in that state the best thing to do is if you want to eat it on a cookie just put a little rice grain piece on there and directly eat it that way and if that's not enough you can always up the dose and make your little amount on there bigger another great way to use it when it's heated up in the syringe is you can directly put it into say like a cup of hot tea or warm coffee and that's a great way to use it as well so another way you can use it at is you can vaporize it so if you have a vaporizer that looks like this this is a barbed coil vaporizer you see right in there there's a coil in there and that's what you're going to want to put the actual you know little des of medicine right in there and that coil is going to burn it pretty hot and you're going to be able to be braise it in that way now the best way to use the distillate is a way called dabbing and that's something that they are not allowed to talk to you about at the dispensaries so that's why I'm gonna do this video and show you exactly how to dab it so there's different devices you can use to dab this right here is called a dab straw so what you need to do is use a little torch and heat up the end of it you're gonna want to get it nice and hot it's going to turn a little bit once it does and you can see mine is a little bit you're gonna want to bring that parchment paper out of the freezer put it right on there and go ahead and take an inhale now this is gonna go way down in so you can tell it is definitely a deep hit for sure but this is gonna affect you really really well so another way to dab excuse me is to use add a brick so this is gonna be probably the most beneficial way to use it so what the daybreak looks like is this right here you heat this piece up right here until that gets red you put this piece on and then what you're going to do is have your little piece of distill it on here put it down in hit it that way and then feel it go away down in and then the party begins I have a good one see y'all later", "OHTBbns6PMQ": "so today we're going to be going over the og kush gram distance by kraft um you're going to see me mention later that it's like also branded oil as well but it's spike craft so let's get into it all right this is a full gram or a thousand milligram uh og kush cartridge this is by craft oil cartridge by craft um and i want to say i picked these up for about like 15 bucks or so and um i will say it didn't work initially on my yokan styx battery and then i tried it on a ooze battery uh and it didn't work so i had to resort to my magneto and it works on my magneto so i don't know the hardware is kind of weird for these i guess that's always been like an issue that i remember having with these because i've had some of these before in the past but other than that uh they're really good cartridges and they're really great they taste this one in particular doesn't really like have like a flavor it's not like a flavored cartridge per se this is like o.j kush you know more like a weed strain so it's got really no terpenes for like you know to taste any kind of way that you would think it would make it taste fruity or good but other than that these don't taste like terpene-wise like or without the terpenes i should say don't taste too bad so these are pretty fire all right so we were talking about the thousand milligram or gram craft oil cartridge i got this at the golden meds federal location and uh i want to say i paid if i didn't i already mentioned it like what uh 12 or like 15 bucks and at that location that's the location where i had the incident like i said where i bought the uh veritas or the veritas and it came empty that's also where i got the uh consumables the keef drinks and soda or whatever but they're going to come these cartridges when you open them like i said i'm going to insert a photo or picture of the containers and tubes what it looks like the packaging and they're going to come with these uh orange tips here and i like these because these are nice i'll keep these on there after i'm like using it still after i've already opened it because what it'll do is it'll help keep like lint and stuff out of the tip and whatnot you'll get some like gunk and [ __ ] in the tips and sometimes you hit them and then they're clogged or whatever you just get some crap in there and then it goes back down into your cartridge and it can kind of mess it up so you don't want to do that but other than that the taste on these like i said they're going to be very earthy they're going to have like a normal like not really any kind of terpene taste that like any terpenes added to it to make it taste like flavorful or like fruity or like any of those flavored ones because this one like i said is uh oji kush so very very good earthy taste i recommend like if you're out there in colorado at all ever anywhere in the dispensaries you can get a hold of the oil the craft cartridges go ahead and make sure you do really great good quality distillate but that's going to wrap it up it's going to be a short one and just a quick review of that cartridge i was only able to get one of them and uh yeah so like i said stay tuned for anything cannabis related or you know smoking related so peace the [ __ ] out like comment and subscribe", "9Udxgbib4sQ": "what is going on guys today we're looking at a few different cartridges but we're mostly just talking about fake cartridges how to spot them how to avoid them how to tell the difference because the last the last year has been pretty horrible for pesticide ridden carts and just off-brand fake cartridges and when I say fake I mean companies that are real or do legitimately produce cartridges but are being replicated like if we start this Cali gold I don't know if either of these are real to be honest but if you look at these two like very clearly obvious like this one makes this one just look like [ __ ] hot dog water like I just smoked a whole [ __ ] card of it I don't know this one's more golden and I've also seen I've also seen Cali golds and like tubes like the you know like kind of like these almost but it's very important if you have a brand that you like it's very important to look specifically at them and look for tiny details so you when you when you go out to get them you know what you're looking for like these on the right here this is a fake TKO can tell yellow tip that's one of the more obvious ones and a lot of the times the fake cartridges will have white tips instead of this instead of these black tips and also it's just little things like like the lettering home you see I don't know how well it'll show up on camera you can kind of see on this this top one is a bit darker and sometimes the lettering is the spacing is weird it's just important to you don't know what you're looking for like research the brand that you like Rhys look at the cart look at the very specific details of it so you don't get ripped off because I mean my a lot of people may think it's just you know it's just one cart like it doesn't hurt me I don't feel hurt I still get high so it can't be faked but it's just a lot of health effects that leads from you know smoking pesticide smoking lead none of its good for you and you should be very aware of what you're putting into your body especially when it comes to vape and oils that's really it I would just I would just say do your research if something tastes off if it tastes funny if it tastes like chemicals stop smoking it throw it away get a new one you feel find a legitimate source that you trust and that they used their cartridges themselves you know what I'm saying even some people don't even care it's just important", "whx9ytKios8": "oh hi i didn't see you there [Music] what is going on people my name is chillady back at you with another dope ass video and in today's video though it is nothing like what you thought it was going to be it's interesting it's new not really it's okay anyway today we're going to be talking about the hard truths and negative side effects of delta a yes that is right so as you guys know i have made two videos over delta eight i made an edible video which if you haven't seen go check it out it's awesome and then i made a video just talking about delta 8 the carts those are my two most popular now i don't want to be known as the delta 8 guy but i've tried to get that bag though there hasn't been a whole lot of research done on it and now i've done more research on it myself i've had time to you know use it whatever um and i want to talk about the hard truths now we're going to spark an actual joint of weed of marijuana so cheers boys so the first thing on my list delta a is similar to delta 9 which delta 9 is thc that we smoke the cannabis and the only dif real difference is that literally the chain effect of the cannabis or the chain number 9 or something like that t-god can pull it up delta 8 tetrahydrocannabinol has a lower psychotropic potency than its close cousin delta 9 thc it is known to connect to both our cb1 and cb2 receptors well so they're very similar delta 8 is being discovered as an alternative to 9 since it produces a less intense gentle enjoyable and manageable high when compared well in the aspects of healing and stuff like that but for delta eight even though you can federally buy it it doesn't get you as high as regular weed does you still fail a drug test so like that's pointless wouldn't you rather just smoke delta nine now i know for some people failing a drug test is a really big deal you know what i mean man i had to change my hair i was over here looking like a 13 year old emo kid you can't accept me at my worst you don't deserve me on my back you're still okay with failing a drug test but buying delta eight online why are you choosing that over delta nine you know i would much rather smoke regular weed than fail a drug test over that all right the second thing now if you watch my delta edible video you'll know that at the end of the video i was smoking a joint outside we're gonna i also did a 1500 milligram edible challenge delta 9 thc and i was not nearly as high as i was off of just 75 milligrams of delton delta 8. i mean i was uncomfortable i was tired i didn't want to do anything i got nothing done that day i just was like done i was like all i want to do is sit here and melt on the couch don't ever fit into the quote or the stereotype that you don't do anything but you need to do more when you're smoking that way people know first it was fine i was relaxed but then after like two hours i was like oh man i was like this is terrible all i want to do is like go to sleep i gave these edibles to a couple co-workers they all said that they were just like super relaxed off one but then i gave them two and they were like oh man it's too much my girlfriend could only one she ate one went to work and was like [ __ ] up she said it was terrible she would never do it again if you want to be lazy and like you want to do nothing all day and you just want to sleep uh i definitely recommend it it would be helpful if like at night on to the next one so the next one is the dab pins you can buy all this stuff online okay this is federally legal so just so you know like i'll put the link again in the description i wish they'd come and [ __ ] uh sponsor me man so i noticed though because i i had used two two dab cards i smoked two of them but first of all the price is ridiculous i mean it's like 35 40 and you gotta wait for it and that kind of sucks that [ __ ] was harsh look look look at me moss that [ __ ] was harsh okay like it really like i wouldn't even blow it out my nose and it would hurt my nose which is crazy and like it would make me always cough and it was like a anybody that i let hit it anybody anybody bro they would [ __ ] cough their ass off like people that smoke like what the [ __ ] it's like a really big rush of like this big body high like just right away and it was weird and then sometimes i wouldn't get high at all like one minute i'd be really high the next i wouldn't it's supposed to have really a non-psychoactive effect that's what makes it different from delta nine um i don't know i don't know if that's really true though to be real honestly that brings me on to the next thing is that it has a pretty bad stigma people for some reason thought think it's like that synthetic weed that spice that [ __ ] back when we were like young i can't believe anybody smoked that [ __ ] i did i will be honest i'll if you guys want to do a story time about that it is hemp it is from him it is hun no there's it is not that [ __ ] but it has a bad stigma i mean it's definitely not that spicy [ __ ] though for sure so that brings me to my last point okay so they're already trying to ban it like they're i don't know when they're voting i think they're voting in like november or december somebody told me in the comments it's like to me it's not you know to me it's not fake weed but i think it's still a little sketchy you know it still has a lot of positive benefits as well though and so i'm thinking if you had seven likes on this video if we get seven likes okay you guys have been [ __ ] killing it bro look look you guys been killing it all right i appreciate all y'all for real we're getting more subscribers i'm trying to hit 50 by let's see what is it september i'm trying to hit 50 at least by the end of october hopefully yeah let's try to do that all right let's get 50 subs bro seven likes we will do a positive review because there are positive things about it i know that i've said that the negatives of it but that's from my personal experience from me trying man let's finish this [ __ ] joint holy [ __ ] [Music] so now i've looked and i found a lot of positive things so hit that seven uh hit that seven light goal boy and we will do another review yeah man that's all i got to say about it this joint is

Mary I look like [ __ ] right now so I'm not really going to show myself but hello I'm here anyways so I'm going to be doing a quick little review on the King pen cartridges the strain one is trainwreck and let me just firstly say how disappointed I am I tried their cartridges before I didn't have that big of a problem with it I thought that the concentrate thought was in there was kind of thick that was kind of I guess a little indicator that there was something up with it but this the current time that I needed another one alright this is only one I could find so this is what I was dealing with and it was a lot worse than last time so mmm let me just show you I guess what this looks like as you can see instantly this looks just absolutely disgusting this is something that you clearly don't want to smoke let me focus game clothes do you see what is in there can you guys tell me what you think that is I mean this is clearly some type of like DIY cartridge or something that someone have [ __ ] me over on like Ivan like look at this color separation right here in this like air bubble that's neither floating up to the top may I tell you like this has been in the year for about nine hours and it has not moved let me flip it upside down nothing you can see it is slowly hardly moving at all but it is just so so alarming this is clearly my fault that I purchased this I got it for about $50 I don't know I'm just very upset about it I don't really know what is in there like I said if you guys know if you guys ever seen thing like this please tell me what you think this could possibly bleep like be cuz I'm actually scared too I smoked it a couple times clearly not that much because it's uh I didn't notice it until it got down to this bubble like how bad it was so yeah guys please be careful with the stuff you buy you never know what's really in it and that's the truth so yeah if you guys can just comment down below and let me know what you think what is in there cuz like I said clearly it's some some [ __ ] and I'm trying to figure it out yeah yeah", "LIyzUVfJpN4": "you hid your vape underneath your pillows yeah and you would come and smoke how often oh I couldn't go longer than like 10 15 minutes without hitting it it was so addicting I brought it with me everywhere I went Seema Herman never expected that what she thought was a harmless habit vaping would end up nearly killing her I took two days for my lungs to fail and I almost died the 18 year old going viral with this photo from her hospital best a tube still pumping oxygen to her failing lungs in her hands a call-to-action asked for like a pen and paper because that was the only way I could communicate and I wrote I want to start a no vaping campaign that was the first thing I did when I opened my eyes Seema's story is just the latest in a landslide of incidents linked to vaping sparking what many officials are calling a national health crisis what we've seen in the course of the past let's say month is an increased number of people coming in with respiratory problems as a result of vaping so far the Centers for Disease Control report more than 450 possible cases in 33 states of lung illness associated with vaping and six deaths have been confirmed in California Illinois Indiana Minnesota Oregon and now Kansas last Friday the CDC issued a stark warning if you are vaping no matter how old you are you should consider stopping like I didn't think of myself as a smoker the vaping just makes it seem like it's nothing like you're doing nothing wrong Seema was in high school when she started vaping nicotine I was 16 the first time 15 and even the first time I bought it at the smoke shop I went in and I was like can I get a pack of jewel pods and they were like how old are you and I said 22 and they were just like okay it ended up becoming my oxygen I couldn't live without it I needed it all the time every day but because all of my friends were doing it all the time and no one else had symptoms that I had I couldn't like I wouldn't even have imagined that maybe this is killing me sima was an active healthy teen she'd been dancing for years even making dance team her freshman year of college but as her vaping habit increased adding in cannabis her ability to dance disappeared she was vaping a cartridge a day that's like smoking the same amount of nicotine as a pack of cigarettes in one day her parents had no idea their daughter had become hopelessly addicted this healthy dancer dancing 12 hours a week stopped dancing because of it stop living because of it stop going to school in college because of it Sima says she was feeling sick all the time over a year I lost like 50 pounds without trying 50 pounds yeah by this summer Seema had stopped going to her college classes she says her health issues were getting worse but no doctor could nail down what was wrong did you not tell the doctors that you've ached I actually did I made sure that every hospital every ER every doctor's office I went to I told them that I smoked but you never thought I can't breathe I feel like I'm gonna die maybe it's because I'm vaping every 10 to 15 minutes no doctor ever said like maybe you should stop vaping it all came to a head on August 15th when Seamas dad rushed her to the ER I said go fast don't let me close my eyes don't let me fall asleep or I won't wake up now why did you say that because I knew I was dying you felt death on you yeah it was terrifying the worst part was I couldn't I couldn't let it like my parents watch it happen to me but hospital staff couldn't figure out why Seema couldn't breathe two days later doctors had to put her on a ventilator I was begging them found her faster event her faster she's going to die it was terrifying it was in that agonizing moment that Seamas cousin revealed her secret addiction she said you know she smokes every day what what are you talking about you said she smokes every day she smokes that beep I said you tell the doctors right now you go tell the doctors right now and I ransacked her room and I found all the vapes it looked like gum wrappers they look like little candy wrappers they look like little cute a mascara wands this progression is so fast dr. Catherine Melamed is a pulmonologist at UCLA Medical Center she worked on Seema's case this was Seema's chest x-ray when she came into our Hospital these hazy white areas here at the base at the bottom of her lungs just show that she could have a pneumonia but what you can then see is if we choose an x-ray from just less than 48 hours later now her lungs all of this white haziness here is inflammation from just day 1 to day 3 is remarkable dr. melamed is on the front lines of what health officials fear is an emerging crisis the National Youth tobacco survey found a 78 percent jump in East cigarette usage among high school students alone but any research on the impacts of vaping lags far behind part of vaping is heating oil and then inhaling that oil and that's not something the lung is used to inhaling and so with that comes an inflammatory reaction that then produces phlegm and sputum and gives the lungs sort of that wet cough when property that sounds terrible and dangerous yes last month 17 year-old Tristan zou fell described how he spent 18 days in the hospital fighting for his life after vaping I woke up just throwing up everywhere how it was just pounding on my chest going 100 miles an hour Tristan lost 15 pounds and said he had to relearn to walk and just yesterday a Texas teen had to be rushed to the hospital after vaping at school passed out and you and I wake up like he was not waking up in Wisconsin today a man was arrested for making thousands of illegal THC vaping cartridges the state of New York is taking an aggressive approach in an attempt to find answers and crack down on black-market products you shouldn't be vaping products that clearly you don't know what you're you're smoking or vaping many vaping products are popular with young adults and teenagers but no company has taken more heat than Jul the industry leader the company says it's designed to get adult smokers off cigarettes but just this week the FDA sent a warning letter to Jewell accusing it of illegally marketing its nicotine bait products as safer than traditional cigarettes without proof Jewell responded we share these concerns about youth vaping it adds it shut down its Facebook and Instagram accounts and recently began deploying new technology to verify IDs this yeah.but Seema's mom blames the whole industry for trying to hook kids early the fact that they market this crap to children and they turned into pink pretty purple packaging candy pisses me off there's a lot we don't know about the both short-term and long-term consequences of vaping and so I would just say don't and the week since Seema has worked to rehab her lungs she still feels that pull to pick up the vape now I don't necessarily crave the nicotine I don't necessarily crave the weed it's just craving like the act of smoking so that's been my hardest thing of like staying away from it but she hopes that going public with her story can keep her and countless others like her alive what would you tell somebody who's under 18 who's thinking about vaping and says I'm just gonna try it one time to see what it's like I would show them my pictures and say I tried it once too and then I tried it another time and then another time it's just remembering that you don't need it like it's gonna kill you for nightline I'm Adrienne banker in Los Angeles hi everyone George Stephanopoulos

cartridge operation busted in Kenosha County investigators say they saved about a half a million and a half dollars of illegal drugs our Hanna Jewell is live with what's been found so far and how this all started with somebody's worried parents yes is this one of the largest drug operations you've had in Kenosha I don't think it was but of this type it's the largest we've ever had and as far as I know it's probably one of the largest in the country Kenosha County Sheriff David beth says the THC vape cartridge operation was being run out of a house and paddock Lake and a condo in Bristol Beth says they seized THC products with a street value of 1.5 million dollars focus was on making money sheriff Beth says two brothers 20 year old Tyler Huff Heinz and 23 year old Jacob hoppings are both facing multiple charges for illegal drug violations that's just the tip of the iceberg in this operation search warrant served at the residences last week led investigators to find more than 31,000 illegal THC vape cartridges almost 100 thousand unfilled cartridges and dozens of mason jars filled with THC oil imported from California they would take a syringe and they inject it into the cartridges the sheriff says they also found guns marijuana buds cocaine pills and $60,000 cash investigators say they may never have uncovered the covert business if it weren't for a couple of parents in Waukesha who tipped them off to a THC cartridge they found with their son I asked all parents out there this is a perfect opportunity and a friendly reminder to have that conversation with your kids six deaths have been blamed on vaping nationwide many more injuries federal investigators are stepping in here now to see if any of those cases are linked to this case here reporting live in Kenosha Hanna Jewell Fox 6 News", "NxEAgqkpn1k": "if you could buy the packaging online then you don't know what is in it but this could have been cup of vitamin e caught with something else kind of sauce you know i got to have grub but i have the granola okay all right he had a bunch of in there i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge when you're dealing with the black market remember that there's risk it's never 100 i just felt like i was going to faint i realized that there's something wrong with me on the news two or three people have already died [Music] it's interesting that a lot of these cases fell off in the fall of 2019 it's true it's gone and that's what puzzles us the most like where these people are still vaping out there we see them all the time like what happened why aren't they coming in anymore vaping illness blamed antifa is [Music] as clickbait headlines warp our view of the world we're going down the rabbit hole to ask how afraid should we really be on this episode the mysterious vaping illnesses of 2019 that created a media frenzy the centers for disease control is warning people to stop using e-cigarettes following several mysterious deaths linked to vaping the cdc investigating a medical mystery spreading across the country tonight two new deaths in minnesota bring the nationwide total to 31 deaths three-quarters were using thc containing products doctors are now warning the public about what they call ivali there was a lot of confusion at first was this an e-cigarette thing a tec thing there were a lot of question marks what we know now is that a lung injury called evali peaked in september of 2019. by february 2020 2800 cases and 68 deaths were linked to the injury but where did divali come from and should we still be afraid of vaping i started going down the rabbit hole by first reaching out to greg rodriguez who was sick with the volume in september 2019. i remember thinking that it was a miracle you know these vapes because there was no smell yeah no more no more dryer sheets right i remember i remember those days but yeah exactly tell me about the onset of you starting to get sick i felt very dehydrated i felt like i was my chest was just becoming very tight it started to vomit like a greenish yellowish type substance which in hindsight it was what was this vitamin e acetate that my body was trying to reject after checking into a hospital in queens greg was put into a coma by doctors and brought here to the long island jewish hospital we sat down with greg's physician who treated greg along with some of the first divali cases in new york so how did you meet greg so we got called from one of our sister hospitals forest hills uh that they had a young patient that they had just put on events later in the er they wanted to let us know that they were worried they were going to run into trouble and could we think about putting him on ecmo what is ecmo exactly ecmo's extracorporeal membrane oxygenation where we take the blood out of someone's body and we oxygenate it in an oxygenator outside of the body and then put it back in so we use it as a replacement for your lungs when your lungs are not working and it sort of buys you time for your lungs to get better i think we cleaned out his lungs every single day for the first two days and what came back with him was just this thick caramel looking stuff just his lungs were filled with it this is his original chest x-ray when he came in and if you look here you could see that both of the lungs are involved there's the lungs should all be black like that and his lungs you can see have a lot of white areas here none of that should be there what exactly in the vaping caused these illnesses i still think we don't know for sure i think a lot of people have a lot of different theories and some think it was the vitamin e that was mixed in with the vaping product and some people think it was the flavoring some people think it was just the marijuana the way that it was heated and mixed in some way so i think we have an exact answer while the science is not fully understood it's thought that additives in the vaping oils break down and change when heated at the high temperatures required for vaping when these substances cool down they may cause inflammation or coat the walls of the lungs and debris unprepared for these foreign objects the lungs push the body into crisis mode when these came out we started to see news stories like you should stop smoking e-cigarettes this is an e-cigarette thing and then it slowly shifted that the story the picture became a little bit more clear that it was oh maybe it's mostly thc products but then still certain people said that they didn't vape thc that it was only nicotine do you believe that it's possible to get some of these illnesses from just vaping nicotine or do you think that they maybe weren't exactly being totally truthful we definitely saw patients who told us it was they only were taking nicotine i think they were truthful i do think that they don't know what they were taking for craig that's exactly what happened basically yeah i had decided to stop buying off the street and then i decided to take the risk of buying them in bulk on the dark web so i thought i hit the jackpot and it turns out that i made a huge mistake with uh trying to get a good deal when i first started to vape it was easy to spot a fake car then summer 2019 these these fake cars um came out the oil inside it was so thick and it just looked the same color it just felt so real what greg is referring to here is known as the bubble test a low-fi way to spot a fake cart a high purity distillate would mean the bubble in the cartridge moves slowly or not at all when it is turned upside down however pure thc extract can be too thick to constantly flow to the coil so cutting agents like terpenes can be added for both flavor and flow counterfeiters who might dilute the product for bigger profits could then add vitamin e acetate to re-thicken the extract fooling the bubble test and the consumer the cdc says that vitamin e acetate is strongly linked to the valley outbreak in 2019 but how prevalent is this dirty card industry i asked greg how hard it was to find a marketplace in the dark web anyone who wants to know would just go on google and type in dark web best marketplaces okay it seems like you know it's that easy you know but yeah it really is after some surprisingly easy google searches i booted up my vpn downloaded tor and started browsing the dark web you're going on the dark web don't you want to go oh okay we're in the tour all right so now i'm on the dark web what do we got here you get a fake id driver's license to have lsd for 30 bucks euro bank notes wow you can get counterfeit money on here unbelievable just spend money to make money what if i find my credit card information on here that'd be really wild okay we're here for purpose we're just looking for weed cannabis concentrates live resin better than sex better than money is it after finding dozens of vendors at dell thc carts i slid into some dms well i didn't get too many responses back i did get a suggestion i could easily find dirty carts in places like liquor or corner stores with some spots in mind i met up with the dower hour aficionado and sometimes camera operator taji amin to do some undercover research so we're in brooklyn right now where cannabis is legal but that doesn't mean that you can't buy underground thc cartridges at a number of smoke and vape shops so we're gonna go look around see what these stores have and i'm wearing a wire and uh hopefully i don't get caught can't see anything right can't see anything i'm wearing a wire here look okay all right let's go check it out oh i'm so sketched out by myself i wouldn't sell to me all right hey man you guys got greens no no okay no go no go there's a couple more down here i think it was a little sketched out by me though i mean we just look like we're hanging out right [Music] right okay the next one's right up here and then what's going on you got any greens right now growth and these are legit right these uh these are bootleg right how much are they 140. all right one day when i get paid man i'll be back all right so you had a bunch of in there they were 140 a piece all right we're going just across the street hey man how's it going how are you doing good how are you doing do you guys have greens thc cartridges yeah how much of these guys 70 70. 45. yeah it's good stuff i've read about though i've read that they they've got the bootleg but there's bootlegs out there these uh so far people coming all right that's all good man thanks dude yeah uh he had a bunch of carts he had like half grams of grams i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not we were given a sample of a bodega bot thc cartridge there's nothing in these right now so i'm not in possession of thc it looked real to me with nice packaging and branding but was it i connected with push a distributor of thc carts in new york city to see if he knew anything about these corner store carts i went shopping for some cartridges at a bodega do like any of your you know i don't do nothing like that no you know where those cards come from i mean most likely they come from l.a if not somebody maybe they make them here the thc cartridges that you're selling out here are they licensed to be made in california yeah some of them all have that are actual have license and there's a lot of vape brands in california that operate in the gray market they have their own original packaging and their own original you know liquid but they don't want to jump through the hoops to get licensed what's the quality of something that's in the gray market sure i mean you can find really good  like i try to stick with brands that haven't gotten so big that they're you know counterfeited if i could buy the packaging oh mine i don't want that i showed push the sample we had obtained to get his opinion on it the main thing is the packaging like this is you know somebody spent good money to to design all this they got big enough and then somebody else said well we want to rip that brand off and they knew somebody a graphic designer they knew somebody in china and they just duplicated it and now this is a clone you don't know what the is in this it's not like you met big chief right right i don't know big chief sure so now you're doing the bubble test right well that ain't moving okay that's not moving so somebody that would only go by the bubble test would say oh this is good because this  don't move it's not moving at all [Music] which would probably mean that you don't want to hit this thing rather than the bubble test push showed me what he called the google test to avoid counterfeit brands so big chief packaging is what you showed me right so the first thing that pops up is that holy so let me see that again this is exactly okay look you could buy 150 pieces of this at 214 a piece wow that looks legit right so that yeah that looks nice that looks exactly the same holy so i have no idea you don't know what this is you don't know what's in that push showed me a number of different cart brands that have counterfeit clones each of them looking like the real deal big chief right now their actual website was all the way down here do they have anything on their side about you know uh yeah here's how to verify the problem okay is there a code somewhere there it is oh not authentic no way yeah so somebody's selling this at bodegas in brooklyn it is not legitimate that's just crazy man yeah google test google test google test for the win realizing that i had a counterfeit cartridge i had to find out what was actually in this thing i reached out to pro verde labs to run some tests on our sample the lab results that came back were alarming to say the least the sample exceeded the acceptable amount for eight pesticides as well as containing concentration of vitamin e acetate we saw this in there at about eight percent little eight and a half percent this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge the pesticides were there at such a heavy concentration that we had to do further dilutions uh enable to analyze that and still be within our calibration per range wow it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated were you surprised to find vitamin e acetate in in this cartridge i was it's well known there's better alternatives i thought by now that there would be no more in production and that what had been produced would have already been either purchased consumed or disposed of apparently that's not the case and then in addition i mean you usually find some levels of pesticides but this one had um a lot of pesticides you know we see in this one biphenyzate at 190 000 parts per billion this is 190 times what would be permissible in california i don't know what the long-term effect of consuming a product like this would be but it's not good the pesticides were not meant to be put in our body are vaping products safe or is the market just so unregulated that it's not even worth the risk all states now have a a supply chain of regulated safe produced products if you're sourcing products from reputable uh suppliers i don't think that there's any concern for that so i'm just curious to know as a professional like yourself what do you think the media got right and what do you think the media got wrong in this situation i think as as human beings we try to simplify things into our what we're capable of understanding and i think the problem with the vape crisis is it's a very very complex issue when we see these acute things happening people dying we look for the culprit and i think it's so hard because i think there's a mixture of components that may be responsible for the hazards associated with it not just the vitamin e acetate so the vitamin e acetate is very much like that could affect you in the very short term whereas these other other the flavorings and the pesticides we don't know what the long-term consequences of them are sure they could be they could result in you know generations of increased lung cancer because of these we don't we don't know you know these could be 10 20 years out till we do we understand it i mean think about the the tobacco industry and we may find the same thing 10 years down the road with vape products associated with cannabis or nicotine this story doesn't really have an ending toxic vape cartridges will continue to flood the streets nicotine thc legal gray market and black market it's out there and even though we don't hear much about a volley anymore it still seems very easy to find vitamin e acetate and counterfeit cartridges the news cycle seems to have washed away the story as we all moved on to more immediate problems which there are a lot of these days but whether you vape or are impacted by stories that have faded from the front page the only way to stay informed is to take matters into your own hands and do what push does google it [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign", "NYweYsi0x2E": "everyone Pope all's well so recently there's been some negativity when it comes to vaping and buying carts off the black market knowing what you inhale into your body should be priority number one and when stepping into the realm of vaping you don't want to inhale something that's gonna harm you long term so today we want to put an end to all the pleasures out there regarding bad practice and to truly answer the question what is a fake oil cartridge and how to avoid [Music] they coil cards go beyond branding and counterfeit boxes the number one question you should be asking yourself is where am i buying my cards from most reputable companies have authorized retail stores that are allowed to sell their cartridges if you're buying from anywhere other than licensed reputable companies or their authorized retailers nine times out of ten it's a fake and companies that are legit aren't gonna risk selling products to non-leap States eBay Amazon Alibaba are not where they experience weavers goaded by high quality oils sure you can compare your boxes to the boxes on the website but unless you buy from the right site you can still get it wrong also if you're buying oils on a budget you're gonna run into the same problem a big red flag is recognizable big-name brands at low prices let's face it if you paid bunk prices you're gonna pay for bunk oils but how do people get ahold of big name brands and if it's the same cart how can it be fake that brings us to fake cartridge answer number one fake oils take these sell cartridges for example defconn action calm says that all seasaw cards must have two logos a serial number and a transparent rubber ring at the bottom of the cart this cartridge is everything a vapor should look for but I know for a fact that the oil inside is fake meaning that nothing's tested and they let the name brand to sell the cartridge for them to me this is black market plus most cards and boxes can just be bought online and some people think that if cartridges and boxes look legit then there's nothing stopping people from putting their own formula inside plus cartridges can just be a replica and they use cheap metals unless you have somebody you trust a source who tests their oils you never really know what's in it from a normal customer standpoint so what could be in here was they can put synthetics in there like k2 which is a huge deal you shouldn't do that oil thickener or anything that you usually wouldn't see on the cartridge unless your oils are solvent free distillates which indicates that the substances are environmentally friendly with no des lunes then you're gonna run into terpenes in PG you want to limit the amount that's put into your oils both drippings and PG act as carrying agents to carry more flavors into your discipline because distillate itself doesn't really have much flavor and no PG does not cause formaldehyde companies only use these agents to give it their own unique formula and it may also indicate on the stickers the percentages that they use but not always think about as buying mid grade versus Private Reserve but you still don't know what a fake oil cartridge is so what's a fake oil cartridge okay so you got your cleaning lab all set up you got your formula lock down and now you're ready to start filling it up cartridges can you just use any cartridge no no you cannot in January this year of 2019 a new California State law was passed calls phase Reena saving that all California cartridges must be lab tested for heavy metals these tests are specifically for for metals cadmium arsenic mercury and lead and phase threes testings limit is 0.5 parts per million of lead allowed in your oils this is a big deal for vape cartridge producers because unless you have glass pores cartridges contain metal and sometimes the exact same cartridge will pass in one lab and fail in another causing producers to just bypass testing all together just to make a quick buck also the price of testing in a lab has gone up so people are cheating the system by avoiding it entirely so why the variation of testing there is no standardized testing procedures for each lab to follow this means that each lab extracts oil differently and if oil touches exposed brass then it may very well fail phase 3 testing so how to metal get inside of your oil cartridges well that's easy 99% of companies buy cartridges from overseas which allow up to 4% of your oils to be made up of lead which is much higher tooth into what phase 3 wants and unless you're on top of your menu this could be a problem let an arsenic is added to metals like brass which help make metal easier to mold into cartridges and oil is acidic so it eats away at cheap metals allowing particles to be invaded into your body so stop giving people reasons to ban they don't become a victim of uncertainty unfortunately some companies don't want to know how the cartridge is made because they don't want to be how reliable and there's just too much money to be made not to get inside of the oil cartridge market we can't change state law or lab test procedures but we sure can certainly change babe cartridges there are companies out there that are responding to the issue companies like Herve pur have already started innovating carts that are guaranteed to pass phase three testing and multiple facilities and are currently leaving the market who completely lead-free cartridges that vetted testing facilities in California that know how to properly test for phase three requirements the next generation of VAP cartridges might be hidden stores in winter time this year but keep in mind that cartridges made before January 1st 2018 are still allowed to be sold and could still be in circulation and states like Washington and have passed similar laws only allowing 0.7 parts per million so be aware of your state's requirements I know it seems like a lot but now you're in the know and knowing is half the battle so please no more black market cards we hope this video was helpful to you guys let us know what you'd like to see in the next video where do you buy your loyal cards did you know that metal could be in it as always don't forget to subscribe and like and we'll see you next time face", "_q2YChBKNZg": "so the video did get cut off like what I thought so I put my other car back on because I didn't want to hit this one yet so I'm gonna go ahead and pop it off and put on the TK old cart let's go oops and go I had to take off the little rubber piece I'm just gonna put it on my other cart just so it doesn't get like dirty and all that they're gonna I got that all put the new one on focus there we go it's not really focusing whatever I turned her off back then I'll turn back on there we go let's see first fat they're killing me I wasn't even sure if it was hitting it's hitting but it's hitting sitting very weird to be honest I don't know I don't know I don't know why to and wait though there's like zero smoke coming out of this I don't know if I got a busted cart what but this is not very good right now I mean some smokes coming out by there's nothing made this videos gonna be short because it's not I can't really hit this like I know the person like close that got me this I'm just gonna have him give me another one because I mean I don't know it's not really hitting that much and you said that like a couple of them weren't um working correctly so decided for one's busted just let him know and he'll give me um like another one so that's straight ahead that'll be in this picture right here nice boat on the TKO there we go that's a thumbnail picture right there so I mean I don't want to say we're done with this one this video I don't want to be finished with just that the form in the video 3-minute video I'm just gonna put on back on my cookies cart smooth that for a little bit just talk almost drop down so I'm just gonna put it back in the case now I know every box like it's like different there's so many different types of details um I guess I'll just depends I don't know so put the cookies cart back on and this oil on here is so I'm trying to get it's so thick because I've had this for like I don't know three weeks and I hit it every day and it does not die let so many people hit it like it's really super thick and lot of smoke comes out so it's pretty good I was pretty good most probably one of the best ghosts I've done to be honest freakin Lippert I like a little cutter something I'm newnode it from but I guess okay I don't even talk about nothing really yeah so uh let me know what you guys are smoking on let me know what type of battery guys use I always say it I just like to know because I'm more looking that cooler batteries come on that - beep um you keep I think that's the name here's the box I don't know what happened on my desk guys babe you keep pretty nice think two stories and then here's the back and then I have just well yeah it's a pretty nice battery small it's not like I've seen the key batteries I think double the size not the best that's mean in the video thing guys for watching subscribe leave a like comment do whatever if you guys haven't already I don't start giving some activity on this channel I've been gaining subs and I'm having fun so yeah and you guys watching she didn't sign me out peace", "76etd8Ye6BA": "[Laughter] [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another nug product video so yeah we got an authentic bag right here i paid 41 out the door for this shopping mall so yeah let's just see how much should i pay yes 40. 40 99 you see that for a full gram cartridge not bad not bad so this is ambrosia this is their nug live resin line and uh yeah as you can see in the back all that good stuff the the percentages i believe it's uh eighty percent exactly well not exactly but that's what they put it and also the manufacture date and all that stuff is uh fairly new about three three months old so not bad date of manufacture is a bit older i think april so but got the nug family i haven't had a nug cartridge in a while i've only had one of their cartridges i forgot what strain it was but i just remember that it was a actually a pretty pleasant experience um i did enjoy it and it lasted pretty long so i'm excited to try this other one and uh let's just see if i can find my battery all right so if you didn't know by now i lost my chill battery i dropped it in the hole when we went to sf you should have seen that video by now but it's unfortunate but we got the press slide right here so you just okay well it's a ceramic heating core as well so that's pretty dope and also nugg.com if you guys want to check them out so just pull it out to use attack wow okay you got the logo right there let's do a little box little thumbnail action hopefully it's getting it go up go down right there so we're going to be hitting it in my dash vape retro you guys already know the deal and uh yeah this is looking pretty good i'm not gonna lie screw that bad boy in let me know if you've tried nug before like i said i've tried it only once and i really enjoyed it it lasted really long compared to these other cartridges so uh i'm pretty excited let's see i haven't used this battery in a while i've been using my chill one so cheers boys oh very very smooth you can you can tell that ceramic heating oil works because i do not taste no burning sensation very very smooth hit it's very very comparable to an erza i'm not gonna lie wow let me take that hit again this is the ambrosia by the way cheers boys that's a blinker for a blinker it's not as fat hits that i'd uh i'd normally see from other live resin cartridges um but the taste is there wow i feel like i could probably like do a five second hit and then a blinker and that will do a pretty decent size hit which is what i'm gonna do so hold on oh there you go wow that is really enjoyable so would i like i said what i remember from the other nug is that it lasts longer than other cartridges so i'm hoping this one lasts just as long because i'm really enjoying the flavor here uh for 41 dollars is generally the price of what you get from typical live resin cartridges uh except for the exception of urza which is like 55 to 60. but this is good i'm not gonna lie like i'm honestly it's one of the better tasting live resins that i've tried lately lately and uh i don't know where i'm gonna be placing this but i know it's on my top five nug is definitely on my top five uh from my last top five video i said i believe it was four or three um i just feel like maybe buddies edged it out a little bit because they had more of a selection and it's a bit cheaper but this taste like i've been on a bad roll right now of buying products and not liking it and honestly i'm kind of happy that i bought this uh this was like the only one in the display that they had left that authentic so i knew that maybe out of all the strains that they had of the nut cartridge that this one was the one that was chose the most and honestly i'm glad i chose this wow i'm really enjoying this and look at it i think i barely even touched it and i just did maybe like two three blinkers maybe two let me take another hit for you guys so like i said the hints aren't going to be as fat for you know blinkers on other live resin cartridges but not [ __ ] bad not [ __ ] bad i'm probably gonna take two more hits off of this and then and then we're just gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed this video if you haven't tried nut cartridges i've tried two out of i've tried two of them so far and it's been two out of two [ __ ] a hit so uh i'm gonna take two more hits like i said cheers boys enjoyable so also i'll post the link to this battery if you guys are interested in that i believe the cheapest that i've seen it was like 15 to 20 i don't know and then there's obviously uh shipping involved but nonetheless very very good battery from daz vape shout out to them always supporting me um yeah just uh i don't know i'm happy about this cartridge right now i'm ecstatic that i bought this cartridge i was gonna buy another buddy's cartridge because i did lose my buddy's cartridge i was gonna buy another train wreck but then i was like let's just try something new and a nug well it's not totally new because i've done a video on their their uh i forgot what strain it was but it was a good strain i'm gonna take another hit for you the last hit and then we're gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed the video you know like it subscribe if you haven't already if you want to and yeah i'll take this hit cheers boys all right guys peace out [Music] [Music] you", "DGLdZi3wxTI": "hey yo how's it going everyone it's your man man i'm back on with a brand new youtube video for you guys today now boys we're gonna be

button and yeah without further ado let's get into this the oil thick plunging it tastes literally just like chem dog like i remember tko chem dog carts before it even looked like this back when it was like a black tip and stuff and yo these are hitting so much better so much harder it's not clogging up like because i remember with tko carts even on the first hit it would just start clogging up right away like oil oil buildup would literally start building at like the tip here and [ __ ] i don't know if that was for anyone else but for me that was my experience but yeah going from that to this really big [ __ ] improvement in the oil too look at that boys that oil is clear as oh it says actually punching all right boys so it's the middle of the video i need you guys right now to like comment share [ __ ] subscribe hit the bell put on all notifications just so then you guys are always notified of whenever the [ __ ] i post his listen new content on the way and yes not just reaction

and i'm out peace you", "Y3vRyew74g4": "[Music] what's up Isaac Lucic here back with another new Intel entitled this is going to be another cartridge review and this is a pretty new company I've never heard of but this smell free cannabis company and they were kind enough to give me a voucher to purchase one of these for $2 and they actually let me try some of their stuff to they have live resin cartridges and they also have cured resin cartridges and her cured live resin cartridges mind you man from what I remember when they let me sample both of them I definitely remember that the cured lie breath and tasted so so good I believe this one's going to be there their live resin one another thing that they mentioned to me which was surprising was that that they're live resin cartridges also has distillate in here so I'm not too sure I mean I'm pretty sure they said that about that but I could be wrong so correct me if I'm wrong the free canvas company but we're gonna be using the pocket you guys already know I will have the link and the one description below if you guys are going to check that out this is a pretty expensive batteries so please check your other alternatives or other options before you finally decide on this because what I like does not mean you like it you know I'm saying I like it because it's a very I it's just a smooth sleek design and build it has a nice feel to it but it is pretty pricey so like I said please just uh know what you're getting into know what you're buying I'm checking all other alternatives because this channel is cool about cannabis content and all and stuff but it's also you know save you a few bucks let you know about the products and always trying to save you some money guys always at the end of the day money is how you gave [ __ ] so I'm trying to hit you I'm trying to help you guys get the best [ __ ] that you can possibly get but not to talking this is going to be strawberry [ __ ] guys very very good stuff [Music] yes I do in a car cut and yes this is the new bandana I'm actually washing the other one so like I got sick of the skull the skull is actually better than polka-dots only have this one because it's black and a black bandana is less is non-threatening at least the gang members you know if I wear a red bandana I could get a shot blue shot black maybe not so much you know so I'm going to open this by the percentage of THC is 86 percent guys you can see right here I'm going too fast and I am sorry right off the back they use the same as select you can see very similar to the select plastic kit from iceless leg and right that kind of smell strawberries so this could definitely be mixed distillate [Music] good yeah [Music] before I get into the review or talk about that hit you might be noticing a faint man noises because I got a fan outside the window so it mentally it's better my room has been getting hot lately it's just because there's probably a lot of electronics there's a lot of people in my room constantly so a fan that attaches to the window is pretty good and it's actually going outward so it's sucking all the hot air out and uh yeah getting into the cart it taste like strawberries not too much I can say about the flavor other than if it tastes like strawberries not too overly powerful you know I do it does fade away quickly just like this lid does you know you but this Li exhales you get that full flavor boat it goes away pretty quick I'm not sure if it's just this lip [Music] so free cannabis fun so like I said earlier there live present and then have cured live resin and their live resin is mixed look a little bit of distillate is what I remember them saying and let's be real like come on this is the way and it tastes like strawberry I mean like live resident tastes like strawberry there's got to be some sort of like terpenes or strawberry terpenes in there that they put in there you know that's definitely not from the plant that I feel like you know some people like the discreteness of oh this guy's just smoking strawberry vape or whatever you know but yes it is good but yes guys this is a legit company okay I actually went to come all the flowers and picked it up I will post their information right here also in the description below and I'd like to mention you know guys just be careful with the cartridges that you were smoking I've been smoking cartridges for a while and nothing has ever happened yeah I always buy cartridges from the dispensary never have I I mean I've tried a few but I don't really buy them like I've tried my homies he usually goes to the sessions and I'm not gonna like I've tried you didn't really like it but I've tried you know yes free cannabis company guys I really really am enjoying this cartridge I'm not gonna lie but you guys already know me I like that I like the cartridges that taste like so but like I said they're cured light resin has that taste so if you do see this company try their cured live recipe try both it does matter try them next to each other and you can actually tell the difference because that's what I did at the booth and yes hopefully you guys enjoyed this video this brand is not bad I don't know the pricing of this I actually have not seen this at my local dispensaries or on weed maps and malls are selling it pretty cheap at the Hall of flowers by a walrus it won't reflect what you're going to be seeing at the dispensary so I can tell you the price $20 for a program $15 $15 I believe it was $15 for the regular live resin cartridges this year and then $20 or the cured live resin but like I said these prices won't reflect what you will see at the dispensary but I am liking this definitely like the cured resin better but I'm not gonna clean about this one if you guys like strawberry taste water looting stuff I really really would recommend this we'll take one more and then [Music] [Music] and there's cloud Stephanie cloud but yeah other than that I'll see you guys [Music]", "20W5V5QsDFs": "yo what's good boys it's your boy exotica and in today's review we're gonna be checking out the choices carts and i'm gonna be trying out the king louie next review we'll be busting out the juicy fruit all right open this from the bottom uh here's the cartridge it's a ceramic cartridge which uh this is honestly my first time trying a ceramic cart and i gotta say i really i'm digging let's go ahead and throw this king louie on this this little mod i got here but uh here before we i'll try to hit this let you know what it tastes like okay got like a berry almost yeah it's like a berry flavor almost i know i say that in a lot of reviews but those usually tend to be my favorite uh flavors but before we hit this let me get a drink of water and yeah we'll get right into this review okay so man i'll tell you i'm ready for this it's been a long day started my new job and man to say the least today was what a day uh my new client was awesome she was chill but some of the things i had to do today was just not enjoyable in the least i'm ready for this man wearing a mask [ __ ] eight hours that sucked but cheers dudes hope you guys are vaping along smoking along rolling your joints hitting a dab i may take a bomb rip at the end of this video i got some in my uh i always carry this is my everyday carry i just carry my dugout one hitter i got some cbd in the bottom mixed with some kush i'll [ __ ] throw a bowl in that but let's get right into this boys okay so for some reason first time you put a card on this says low atomizer or something but here let's hit this cheers boys really smooth uh it's a clean like usually to me carts aren't really smooth on my throw like they usually burn my throat that's honestly why i haven't been doing cartridge reviews because i just i don't like the way they personally make my throat feel afterwards i mean obviously me carts are a little harsh on my lungs so if i cough a lot don't take it too seriously or think the car is bad because it's not it's just my lungs but before i hit the skin so i don't cough snag another drink of the water oh and the aftertaste of this sticks in your mouth so uh so well so those one hit i wasn't high before i started uh before i started this video so just see how many hits it takes me to start feeling it and about how long uh don't mind the beanie i'm just wearing it because my hair is kind of messy and yeah my golden state had was supposed to come today naturally didn't come everything was running late i had some cartridges [ __ ] my dude didn't get his till late so [ __ ] put me half and wait to try these which i'm really glad it says uh lab tested and ensure potency no pesticide no bleaches no clay is made from uh made from 100 absolute pure delta nine distillate you can tell this is a black market cartridge just because the worrying that made no sense no pesticides no bleaches uh and then it said no clays and then it doesn't put a period or anything it just says made a hundred percent from absolute oh it's gonna appear oh okay i guess it does i'm just reading it wrong i don't know you guys tell me if that looks weird maybe i'll i'll do um maybe i'm starting to feel this car uh they say they're passionate about our products we pour our hearts into our products we understand the consumer should always be first only organic terpenes says our product contains organic terpenes and never will contain pg and other harsh chemicals ingredients it says premium donut9 distillate and the terpenes of course it's got your scratch scratch there for your code put that in your camera take it to the site you can check the see if this is authentic and i believe i did check this uh specific card it does tell you um like it's got all the tests like there's a lot of tests that it says it ran and it'll let you know if it passed and what it was i believe it uh i only seen the juicy fruit i don't think i seen the king louie but i'm pretty sure the uh the juicy fruit was tested in that 85 like i said i don't know if that's true it's pretty easy to mimic and fake stuff online so don't be one of those guys in the comments saying yo you're [ __ ] vaping dog water or hot dog water or some [ __ ] nah bro it comes down to who you're getting off of and honestly i've been smoking for years now i'm gonna know what i'm consuming not a hundred percent you know they could be bad [ __ ] but i mean that's like everything let's get one more toke i am feeling good off that one hit like i said it was a pretty decent hit but let's get one more also i'm vaping this at 5.2 watts if you were curious i also says full ceramic cartridges free no heavy metals and then it says no metals whatsoever which i mean if you look at that cartridge that pretty much looks just like ceramic i mean maybe after i finish this i'll go ahead and try to take it apart see if it's actually ceramic and yeah but overall i like the carp presentation it looks nice it's not over the top you got the nice see for choices and yeah overall i'm pretty uh i'm pretty happy with this i would say if you find in your area snag one yeah i'd say definitely try to snag one of these if you if you can find these in your area grab one try it out i would highly recommend if you can find the king louie snacky king louie so good um smooth i don't know if you guys want to see the bubble test i don't really ever do the bubble test anymore because i feel like it's pointless but as you can see that oil's not moving and there's the oil color as well let you guys get a good look at it [Music] there you go pretty nice color to it very very light golden tint pretty good oil overall i would rate the uh flavor i would give this a solid i'd give this a solid 8 out of ten it's pretty flavorful stays in your mouth kind of coach your mouth with those terpenes uh hi like i said i took about whatever it was two three hits i'm feeling you know starting to mellow out feeling good uh actually i kind of want to take a blinker off this this thing turns off after 10 seconds i believe to make sure you don't burn out your your vape uh this was originally for um like a regular vape like an e-cig but let's go ahead yeah i'm really ripped dudes this is an indica as well the king louie is or it says it's an indica which i would go with that does feel pretty much like an indica i'm like real chill laid back here we go boys i'm gonna take a drink and let's hit this believer in this video also drop a like uh hit this subscribe button over here i believe it's down there hit hit that subscribe button for your boy and uh yeah let's do this boys hopefully taking blinker with me if you are let me know how long your blinker is and uh yeah cheers let's get right into this get my breathing down all right let's go we're gonna go until this turns itself off uh my body feels nice and warm we're chilling you can see in my eyes we're at that level [Music] song again all right boys i'm not gonna cut out any of the coffin i smoke a lot of cigarettes so i'm gonna cough it's just part of it honestly you gotta cough to get off um come on where's my where's my lighter all right [Music] but yeah if you guys would like to see the juicy fruit be reviewed let me know and i will drop a video on the juicy fruit by choices good thumbnail okay and yeah i hope you guys enjoyed this review um potency i would give i'll give a solid 8 out of 10 as well um yeah i can't say i can't really say anything bad about them they don't burn your throat like after you you may cough but it's like a normal weak cough it's not like that my throat's burning because whatever is in the cartridge is not supposed to be there but yeah my sinuses are draining so i'm going to wrap up this video spin your boy exotica i will see you guys in the next one peace", "50mHGixFKPA": "all right hi everybody back with another Alpine live resin I mean probably tell my eyes are shot cuz I just took a huge rip oh this one's Girl Scout cookies it's a 1 gram oh and here's the testing on it it's one of the highest th fees so far 79 2% CBD a little over one at a CBN which doesn't leave much else I mean you know you add those up and then one of her terpenes are there I've got to be a lot high on the terpenes because I can't F I can really taste this stuff so Girl Scout cookies if you haven't had that one that's an OG got that fuelie taste to it and also almost like a fresh cut fresh-cut grass kind of like fresh herb tastes going on on this one it's like got a background of that few leaf layer and almost like a firework kind of slow furry taste not taste but like I don't know just brings that to mind it smells really good I definitely think these are a new favorite one because that just the strength of them and also these holes on the bottom they're much lower in the cartridge and my results in last boy East you're able to get most of it out of there I mean by the time it doesn't pop you can hardly see anything down there on the bottom yeah this is definitely one company to check out now it's agreeing that this one is a hybrid might be a little more towards of the sativa in remember Girl Scout cookies from Alpine vapor no live resin really has that that fresh taste coming through a little bit of the piney flavored yeah I just wanted to share that with you I think I'm gonna I'm gonna stick with these for the time being yeah I'm digging these there uh no they did a good job on these so uh yeah if you're ever checking these out I would give them a try I've tried three so far and then they are all top-notch they're very strained specific I mean it totally comes through and we can taste the strain that you got so yeah just want to show that to you guys thanks for watching hope you liked it see you next time", "Vaeye7F_AHQ": "welcome to the show this is ice thought images coming at you with another vape cart review this one's from presto this one is zoodles so I can only assume that the sticker on the back that I'm gonna show you in a second is because of the vitamin e acetate recalls to where they had to recheck everything I'm trying to associate that with that otherwise I don't see any reason why there's like three to four stickers on this thing so I'm gonna read what it says on it but I as I tried to peel up some of the other stickers it just started ripping and peeling so I couldn't read what was underneath it um but lab taste the lab test date is two twenty four twenty production date is six 21 19 so you gotta figure this is eight months old it's eighty one point five nine percent it's got the transfer numbers as testers provide a mini acetate psi tabs labs tested past sorry jumbled up my words right there but I don't see if you can make that out but there's like four little pieces that go up you know so as I said I tried to feel to see what it said underneath there was some other batch test numbers I was trying to see if the THC number had changed like they decided to ramp it up but it says immediate effect lasts two to three hours 510 threads 3.7 volts THC distill it and curated turps tells you how to connect the battery wait 30 seconds between hits so I'm going to assume so you don't roast out the coils too quick but on the front of this it says happy and relaxing with flavours of sweet fruits and berries so happy and relaxing I'm going to assume that this is an indica dominant hybrid just I forget I've looked it up before I just can't remember I will put it in the description so that you guys can you guys can see that once again the open dog besides let the magic again and then you've got this enormous box for that tiny little thing right there there we go so same thing you got your heating element slash threat protection and then you basically got your mouthpiece condom sits out we're gonna dry hit it it's been a minute since I actually did this part because most of them don't seem like they're moving at all really got a big bubble but the bubble still not moving so it's a slightly darker oil not super dark but no darker then you know the live rosin that I had only by a couple shades just nothing like super drastic like this is almost pitch black why that one's like a nice golden like we're gonna crank on my own a pair uni pro we're gonna crank that out to the 3.7 that it's set on the box drag it and move on sweet berries for sure on the initial drive over okay I didn't even even have that on please so here we go very tasty I have to see how the effects and the high that I get from it but very tasty the flavor profile is exactly how maybe not exactly but how I prefer my weeds and [ __ ] throw them with a nice fruity berry flavor oh excuse me I'm gonna sneeze again tickle your nose so two for two I'm gonna say that this is good feel it through here initially maybe a tiny bit here but that's probably from the the sneezing and the sneezing I was gonna say coughing but I didn't really cause um yeah definitely digging it this is probably not my favorite cart that I've had recently I've been drawing a blank on which one it was you know you're really digging that one you know this is about presto just one of my favorite cards I'm not unfortunate but unfortunately for presto is through platinum vapes and then I got big gasp right here so trying to branch out try more companies my buddy's got some lore or one law or klore or some [ __ ] like that not claw clear I don't know Allah I'm gonna see if I get my hands on one of those maybe today or tomorrow just so I can at least try that brand even though I'm sitting on a couple cards right now just with all this coronavirus crap you know stock up get what you need and as I stated in a previous video if you're someone that uses this for strict medicine because you absolutely 100% need this [ __ ] get out there and get it I'll talk to your local guy and see if they can keep you supplied during this time because otherwise if they close down the dispos I hear that they're gonna allow kerbside so that you can get some delivery drivers to just curbside it to you but with that being said only time will tell with that but just free up if you can before any more madness happens to where the whole state is completely shut down there's nothing [ __ ] for you to do other than get gas and food I don't fully see that happening but I didn't foresee I mean this happening you know with h1n1 being [ __ ] sixty point eight million people had it and over I think it was close to thirteen thousand people died from it and that was during the Obama administration and not a single person bad at and I I'm sorry nobody closed anything down nobody gave a [ __ ] SARS was around people were just wearing masks but otherwise nobody gave a [ __ ] now all of a sudden and I don't I'm not trying to get into politics but obviously now Trump's in office people don't like Trump now all of a sudden is this gonna be a political move to where he gets to say uh you know we got the cure he comes out looking like a hero and boom he's in office for another four years I think he's getting in office regardless but is it something like that is it way deeper and a conspiracy aspect or are people just reading into this way too much and it's just to get people to panic by I don't know I'm just one person that has a mind that just tries to think of a lot of different possibilities but my mind typically moves towards the more negative outlook just so when the happy happens it's like [ __ ] yeah it's just that much sweeter but when the negative happens it's like yeah I figured that was gonna [ __ ] happen you know it's not the best way to live but it's not the worst way to leave you those happy moments are just that much more happy which is dope but that's just mourning ramblings littles presto Wittig I could sit around and smoke on this and so far I don't have a real hazy nauseous headachy sick feeling from hitting us like I got from the mitten extracts before the recall and all that [ __ ] so I don't know if there was some stuff in theirs or they were cutting corners or whatever I don't know I just did not like four different strains which is [ __ ] unheard of like if I buy four strains of something else I got four Presto's here and the odds on me hating all four you know it's obviously one in four but it's almost slim to none I'm gonna like one of them usually so I was actually disappointed that I didn't like a single one the flavors weren't good that but not with presto so some of your local dispose would be running these at four 400 you might get lucky and find four buy one for a penny or five for 100 you know any anything like that but they are running deals on press DOS I just hate presto I don't understand why you have such a big [ __ ] box but I'm not the marketing person and I'm not you know I'm not pushing your company I'm just saying from a perspective like this that's big enough boxes it is this is just thinner but super wide so you just got all this open space like you could you could turn around and sell these in a three to four to five pack deal so you go to the disco they've got this and it's an assorted pack so you're gonna get it you know you're gonna get these you're gonna get the Sour Diesel the Blue Dream the GG for the gelato you know and you can have them all in a flavor pack at a set price so you're running for 400 as it is say you throw all six in there okay six for 156 / 160 you know something like that I would prefer a round the 130 mark but I understand you still gotta make profit and blah blah blah like you're also you boom here's an all sorted so people are gonna buy the assorted packs you know you just got to figure out how deep your profit margin needs to run well but that being said presto thank you for some some quality products I did a video on Sour Diesel yesterday I just didn't put it up yet so by the time this one goes up that one should be up and get out there and get it zoodles it's really good any of the other information I will put in the description below so like hit my logo like right here sob hit the bell for

sauce carts 1000 milligram 1 gram we got a hybrid today GG for Glu number 4 alright let's pop this bad Larry open not keep any of you guys waiting much love to you guys who have been should scoops subscribing on the road to a thousand subscribers is gonna be a bumpy long high road so glad you guys are here with me to enjoy the stay so we'll check on this bad boy it doesn't move love it that color you can just see like that saucy color no dirty dissolute here boys so once again with the new packaging that they came out with not the containers anymore that a really adult proof to open they have still had the same Madi fine tip Madi fine black gold atching and you must make sure you got this at the bottom if your heart does not come in a cellophane wrapped package in a container like one of these and has official doesn't have official at the bottom that's just probably think because they now have an official website for all you guys who thinks TKO carts are fake they are not fake they're a brand that's not patent so they are allowed to be black marketed so the company themselves TKO extracts make sure they put features like this to rule out the fakes so let's not keep us waiting let's try this GG for let's get high today with you guys alright alright so well I underestimated the hit like every other sauce cart like a dad but that Jamie harder one thing I'm gonna say sauce carts if you're looking for flavor or if you're looking for a cart that tastes exactly like a DAB go for the sauce carts if you're looking for the flavor go for the raggy cards because this is only dab I saw ahead that's all I taste out of this is a dad none ones I taste Terps and bud that's what I taste so if you guys liked the video leave a comment subscribe on the road to a thousand

again today we will be going over these TKO just a little bit better anyway they are TKO herbal extract carts great color great to still it and this is wedding cake so let me go ahead and get this thing ready for you okay as you can see I'm using the Europe and sticks and I have it the lowest setting it goes red green blue and red does just fine this thing it's amazing I would have to say these TKO carts are probably my favorite now that I have had and let's turn around take a puff see what it's all about that is so smooth these are the smoothest cards you take a big hit little expanse you take a big hit it will expand and it will choke you out I like to take nice smaller hit so I don't call my lungs out but it doesn't taste like pure distill it it has the actual flavor the smoothness and it has the herb flavor to it so overall TKO - thumbs up for sure my favorite carts so far so definitely if you can get your hands on them check them out thanks for checking it out later guys appreciate everybody watching like and subscribe", "D5RMnYYcaKE": "[Music] what's going on guys so if you don't know my name is Mario Pepsi Mario Pepsi you can look me up I've been doing video game reviews video game videos for a while now product reviews is something that's a little bit different for me so I'm going to get into that so I'm always more welcome to constructive criticisms and help me get better help me provide better content for you so you can be better entertained which would in turn make me happy by providing better content so what I wanted to do for you guys here today is take a look at two different bait cartridges for us some wax here I am in California's prop 215 compliant obviously but what we're taking a look at today and what I'm using is I have two different batteries and I'm going to tell you why I have two different batteries and I'm probably going to get a couple more batteries just to kind of play with them because they're there's a lot of different technology and different batteries out there different ways of having batteries so I kind of want to play with them see which ones are better and obviously help you guys make your purchases save you guys some money too because if you're like me you see new things you kind of want to try them at the same time you're just a little bit skeptical so they give you a comparison let me take off the cartridges here for you real quick but I've had and I've had two of the ones I'm about to show you here so this one here is if you could see it there with the edging this is if I remember right a bloom's farm pin and I had another one just like this from open base and open Bay pin got both of those for free one those in a raffle from a shop in Bakersfield called cannibals collective so I won those in a raffle the product as far as the wax goes that was in the pin was amazing the pins themselves are also really cool really great here are some benefits that I like about it on the bottom is a pretty cool feature you can use it for like your smartphones there's a little button on there which is pretty nice so if you're vaping you got your phone out or you're trying to do some you can just you know touch on it real quick which is pretty cool the only problem with both of these pins that I have is that there's no off switch which is cool and badass same time the cool thing is pull out of your pocket you're ready to go a good charge usually last you all day however you'll notice when the battery starts to die off your bass start to go as well so they're going to get less and less you're not necessarily wasting medicine but you definitely start pulling on it more you start using your PIN more and then eventually the better goes dead and then you have to charge it again so that's one of the things I'm not a fan of if I remember right they do have pins just like this that do turn off now I think it's the same as kind of like this one here but you just push on the bottom of it where that little button is that showed you like five times and it turns off so I'll definitely check those out see if that helps with the debate quality at all because like I said the cartridges I usually get are the brass knuckles and brass knuckles tend to need hotter temperature or the battery seems to be like on a seventy-five to a hundred percent charge to get the best like pull from it so what I've had it did is uh I bought the brass knuckles pin which was a little bit more expensive you can see the etching there and just like I was telling you it has a button on the front here where you hit it five times so you go one two three four five it starts beeping at you and then it's on and then when your vape cartridges is there you just pull and then you hit it another five times one two three four five and it's off and when it's on all you do is hold down the button and draw to usually like a five second timer and then I usually let it cool down for about a second or two if I'm going to do like multiple pulls at once and that's pretty much it but I like the fact that you can turn it off because that ensures that your battery is going to stay charged longer so if you are using it for a full day or you're taking it somewhere it is more convenient than like I said having something that's only going to give you a half 25% pull so you're getting like a one tenth of a percentage of your medicine that you need so that is something that's really cool so normally what I do is I show you the comparisons between the pins but I I'll save that for another video when I have more pins to kind of show you really what I want to do is just kind of go between the two medicine here to kind of show you so what I'm going to do first is I'm going to hook up the brass knuckles here i'mso brass knuckles with the brass knuckles pin and this is if I remember right the Grape Ape so we'll go one two three four five turn it on there I let it usually let it sit for a second or two just to make sure it's on make sure everything is good check it it's on and then we'll do a full five second pull we'll take about a half second off and then we'll do another three seconds so a total of eight seconds just to kind of give you guys a full cloud to kind of see how the pin and the medicine works with this one here so exhales so we get a nice clean pull so don't have to take breaths in between so you can see they're not bad but like I said if you have a pin kind of like this or one that's not very strong or doesn't have a full battery charge I just charge this one before the video you will notice that your clouds are a little bit less and that lets you know that your battery is running low so that's one of the things that I keep track of it would be cool for someone to come out with a portable vape in for you know for 27 10 pins or cartridges that maybe had a little battery meter on the side something like that just so you can keep track of it yourself because like I said a full battery is always going to give you a better pull so again the Grape Ape there with the brass knuckles and then this is the amber industries this goes for I believe anywhere from 20 to 25 for the half gram but the difference is here this is a solvent free distillate and they use a ceramic coil so it burns a little bit different and that's one of the things if you've tried a bunch of different vape pens and cartridges and things like that they all burn a little bit different depending on the coil method and what they're using I've used ones that actually have wicks in them things like that it's not that they're bad they're just you got to kind of have more on hand and kind of have them all at the same time to really see what the difference is and kind of play with them and what I'd like to see is the same medicine in each different cartridge to really compare them to see which one works best but I'm sure maybe hopefully that's what those companies did and that's why what they went with the options but since there are so many different options out there just seems like there's just a wide variety that I don't really know if there is a best one yet so hopefully by doing this we'll pinpoint that down but without further ado again this is a granddaddy purp buy amber industries so going to do this a full same pool method and everything here so it kind of matches up to give you the cloud comparison but this one does definitely [ __ ] hit you a lot harder as far as your your lungs go it seems like when I when I pull on this one so to me I feel like I get a bigger cloud with the amber industries it seems to be a quicker hit as far as feeling the medicine work and everything but it doesn't seem to hit as deep as the brass knuckles coats I definitely like the way it burns it burns really quick so I feel like this one would be a good one to throw on any different pin especially for the price you really can't beat that like I said 20 to 25 bucks so that's pretty good and then the other thing I like is the different flavors that they have so I went with the granddaddy purp kinda to have something close to the great base obviously by brass knuckles but I've tried their key lime pie which is ridiculously good and again the great thing about all the different vape cartridges and flavors that a lot of these companies have is they're portable you can take them anywhere you want to go and there's no smell so no one ever really knows what what you're doing which is also great so I'm a big fan of the different like fruity flavors but at the same time I like my heavy indicas too but I hope to definitely be able to do more of these videos and like I said have more of these to share with you guys and kind of test out I'm based in in the Central Valley out in California so there's different shots that you guys can find these for I'm sure if you jumped on Twitter Instagram you might be able to pull them up like I said brass knuckles and amber industries amber industries is one of the newer ones that I kind of wanted to check out most people already know about brass knuckles because they've been around for such a long time but I hope you guys enjoyed this video like I said let me know what you guys like to see more of whether it be baked cartridges more flowers more wax different things like that and then I am planning on hopefully being able to go to events do things like that and bring you guys along and show you guys what those are out like here in California too if you haven't been to one so until next time guys again my name is Mario Mario Pepsi follow like share and again let's hopefully special online together we'll do some live live sessions so everyone can join in and toke together hopefully

guest justin cures what's good doing a west coast we tour review featuring the buddies brand forbidden skittles liquid diamond live resin one gram baked cartridge i'm excited we've got a buddy's brand vape battery it's going to be an exciting time now the cool thing about this particular west coast we tour review is that justin's review his score is going to be the official review score for buddy's brand why i work for buddy's brand so to be fair and unbiased you're up i need you to be extra tough you're on camera always honest with you i know you're always honest stay honest okay i'm not paying you there's no money right now i've given it's a 6.5 all right here we go but be honest so what we're working with here is the one gram cartridge see we got a buddy see cell cartridge 76.7 on the total cannabinoids thc 74.61 terpenes are always listed right so buddies greenbox terpenes are always listed on the back we've got eight point two one percent on the total terpenes we've got three terps always displayed which terpenes do we have this beta caryophyllene limonene in eight yep yep which is from hops i think this is going to get me this is going to bring like that stoned uh that's like the one word that one word i think i'm like really that's gonna get slightly 8.2 woody yeah it's going to be good 76.7 total contaminants with our cartridges i always recommend a four to six long like vapor rip you if you have a battery that can change temperatures put it on the first like lowest temperature setting or the second the second lowest and you're generally pretty solid if you have a battery like this one that just pulls then four to six seconds should do you just fine if it doesn't if you pull it and your battery doesn't like do anything then consider changing out your battery that's how you can really tell it's that real deal live resin liquid full spectrum liquid diamonds extract is harvested fresh frozen and processed at sub-critical temperatures are you ready this is real live resin nothing but no atoms this is that low temp life right here five seconds no blinkers only type of [ __ ] you don't want to do a blinker and burn at all yeah don't burn the terps all right let's see i love it clouds right there see what i was saying oh i get that taste that skittles are right off the bat man that's bomb that's really smooth really smooth probably one of the smoothest uh live residence panda i've never tried it usually sometimes i'll get like uh which one we'll call which is harshness in the background right like super citrusy vapes tend to be kind of harsh sometimes right because it's so like potent or powerful tasting right right this is the key word really is smooth light there's a piney gassiness in there like the turks kind of roast the nostrils right but then that when you finally exhale it out you get a slight citrus just like anyone you know i'm really i'm really getting the uh uh um the humeline and the karyophiline coming through because when i was blowing it out it's almost like it's like a it's like a um like a cider almost yeah it's like a right it's like a earthy cider citrusy earthy and then the woodiness yeah i really like the color i really like the taste i really like the flavor um i mean everything speaks for itself like everything is the high letting you know what it is uh right off the bat seeing the terpene profile i'm like okay this is gonna get me stoned this first hit i feel uh i feel like calm i kind of feel it in my legs a little bit what do you feel and i feel uh that indica high like you're where you get it behind the eyes you know and already making money what do you feel like behind the pressure in your eyes because that's what i'm really getting right now is just like i want a homing sensation i want to squint and i'm also like you almost could just go to sleep just puffing on this bin it tastes really really good and the high is immediate in terms of both the body feel and like a slight burst of energy as well get it out the nose just to get just to get more of those major curves and that's how i kind of like you know if that if that really like is a burning sensation sometimes i'm a little iffy on the pen that's why i was saying this one's really smooth no harshness even with that i'm not even no no phasing over here and i'm i'm stoned presentation appeal i'll think consider all these things right now okay there's a number out there i want you to marinate on it presentation appeal the color the taste the smell you can smell the turkey you want to get stone buy this banana potency more information available would you recommend it overall what are you thinking i'm thinking i would recommend this especially this strain like i would say go find this because uh two hits and i feel like i took a dab yeah two doc feel like i feel like i took a dab nice dad you know um and that's hard from from a pen to give you that such a head change so that's like really upping the score for me um and then also i like i said i really like the color on it um yeah this packaging's there your major terps you letting me know the potency uh doesn't really show me anything on cbd but that's okay that's not everything that says that happens um but you're showing total cannabinoids and that's what matters that's what matters so overall i'm gonna give this a nine a solid nine i think what would be missing is just maybe more i need to do that well that's what i was going to say just more of the information on on what like this specific strain is going to do to me what it's about and that would be it that would be it i mean everything else is is letting me know this is this [ __ ] is what it is it's fire yeah that's what the color the color is come on come on that's consistent right there so but uh i know you guys you all heard it here and also from the rosin head himself fresh as well yeah this is this is our newest drop really good solid night i tried to bring i tried to bring some the buddies maybe maybe throw some more info on there it doesn't hurt people want to know i want to know you know what's up with this strain and that's about it other than the

back i realized i really never actually introduced myself maybe a few times but my name is alina for those of you who don't know today i'm going to show you guys how you can eat the oil in your carts or how you can use it in edibles i'm going to show you guys how to make butter infused butter with your carts it's very easy once you get the distillate out of the carts you can use it in many different ways such as just plain straight up eating it adding it to butter you can also use it in quite a few different recipes i do have a few on my channel that i think it would go very well with such as adding it to oreos or to dummies um i'll post the links of some suggested edible videos for you guys to make below and check those out you can use the oil in most of the carts at least the ones that are distilled which if you're getting them from dispensary that's what they should be if they're ordered online it's hard for us to really know um i tried one of or some of the oil from one of mine that i ordered online and i'll show you guys the clip here of me um trying it and it really worked just straight up eating it even just a little bit of it i'm also going to show you guys in this video how to add oil to butter so you guys can have infused butter that way and in this case you guys don't need to decarb or anything like that because the thc is already activated when i show you guys how to make the butter with the oils in the cart you could also do the same thing with purchase the salad so in any recipe where it calls for half a cup of infused butter a quarter cup of whatever amount of infused butter if you don't have that infused butter that was made the traditional method you could also just add distillate to butter which is what i'm going to show you guys how to do in this video so the verdict is in and don't smoke glass smoke grass today i will be showing you how to use carts and edibles or how to um just straight up eat them slash what happens when so um i have a bunch of miscellaneous cards i have um some that i ordered online a long time ago um and then i have some that are from dispensaries um and i don't really want to vape the ones that i got online i just don't know if i really trust them anymore i even have like um a whole full one that i'm probably just gonna eat somehow um but yeah so what i wasn't sure about is they should all be distilled and they definitely will be um the ones i'm getting from the dispensary i definitely know are with one's online i'm not so sure um but it's like a 95 chance that the cards that you have are just phillip um but that's what this method i'm going to show you guys is for and if it's a different type i don't um i can't confirm that it would work the same one thing i wanted to try is if i would eat some of the liquid what would happen um and i did that a few days ago i recorded it and i'll put that in here and i'll show you guys exactly what happens okay so i have one of my cards here which is mostly empty and i'm going to um consume it i don't know how much i'll see how much i can get out um and we're going to see if this is going to do anything because i don't know if i need to heat them up first for them to work or if they're just gonna um work on their own so instead of trying to just figure it out because like i said i bought these online and i don't actually know how legit they are um so we're just gonna try it and we're gonna we're gonna see if that works i'm going to i couldn't unscrew this by hand so i'm just using um a rubber glove for a little bit of grip or this isn't rubber i don't know what this is called but and then um these for some more grip and that comes off pretty easy i think yeah so there's that [Music] i guess i should turn this right here [Music] um i'm just trying to see if i can pull this thing out okay i think what i should do is put this in some i'm gonna put this in a cup of hot water first so that the uh liquid will warm up and kind of i'm just gonna place it like um this direction so when i take it off the liquid will be down here okay so i have a i just have a shot glass that i put um i filled with hot water from the top and i'm gonna place this in here um like this so that um the water will heat it up and it'll drop to the bottom where i need to access it from so i'm just popping that in there and i just made sure that there was enough water to actually cover um all the way up to here so i had to fill it up pretty high and then i figured this was probably going to cool off pretty fast so i got another bowl of just some water that i put in the microwave for about 30 seconds and i'm gonna place this into the bowl to kind of like just keep the water warm and i'm just gonna check on it every so often and then um put warmer water in there although it's already dropping down so we might not even need to change that so yeah i'm just gonna leave this here for a few minutes okay so i had to warm up the water once through this whole thing it took about like 20 minutes for it to um melt so there it is there's still a little bit there but i'll just dig it out okay so i'm just gonna dry this off there we go and then coming undone there okay so i'm just gonna use this toothpick to to get it out i'm just gonna straight up like eat it [Music] it doesn't taste bad it doesn't really taste like anything i hope this works so yeah i'm just scraping it out with a toothpick it's a little bitter and then i'm going to take a lecithin pill and i usually just take these when i take edibles just because it helps a little bit so this is how much is left in here and i'm gonna get the rest of that out which i got almost like i consumed almost all of it but the little bits they're sticking to the side i'm gonna get out when i um get the rest of all of my cartridges like when i do the whole thing which is this what this video is for um but yeah so it is 3 13 so 3 o'clock and i will report back and see if this works or if it does absolutely nothing and i'm really hoping that it works because it's gonna be so much simpler to utilize these carts um if i don't have to deal with heating them up and making sure that all goes smoothly but yeah so i'll be back in a few hours so it's been it's five o'clock so i don't know two hours oh my it worked for sure um i think it's just you know when you take some edibles and you're like oh they're not working i should take some more and then you take more and then you're like oh my god i shouldn't have taken more that's how i feel right now my mouth is so dry so dry and some juice um sorry yeah it definitely worked and i don't know how much stronger and how much more it's gonna kick in like for how long for but i can't even think straight but um this is like really good because and i didn't smoke any weed today at all the only thing i consumed along those lines was that um little cart thing so because i wanted to be sure about it like i was tempted to still hit the pen but i was like i want to be sure that if i feel something i know it's from the pen but yeah okay so i'm gonna i'm gonna reflect back more on this when i'm in another in a better state in the video part next okay okay bye oh gosh i'm so chill very very guys this hits hard okay i feel like i could have taken less you know just be careful with how much you take i think it's a very good amount that i took i think hopefully it's snowing outside also which is insane [Music] october and freezing too so yeah as we see clearly it worked very well i actually was licking some earlier and i shouldn't have because i have to make sure what i'm doing is correct and even just a little bit of it like works very well and i find i have a pretty high tolerance for edible so i was surprised how little of it it took for it to have a strong effect i'm gonna try this one that was broken i'm just gonna like lick whatever is left off of there so i was just playing around with my cartridges to see how to open each one and i was going to open this one and when i was using the pliers to turn it it wasn't i'm turning up here so i decided to put um this onto the glass part in turn and even just a little bit of pressure and it completely shattered so just an fyi when you guys are trying to figure out how to open your carts don't put your pliers directly on the glass i know it's common sense but i still did it so just fyi i don't know if we'll be able to salvage any of this i'll see what i can do but i don't really wanna end up putting a lot of glass in my mouth okay so with the broken one it's not really there's so much glass on it so i don't really know how else to use it so i'm gonna try adding it to this pipe that already has like some stuff in there it's mostly burnt um i'm gonna try and melt this into here and i don't care if there's a little bit of glass in there um because that's fine i'll just throw it out after um so let's see if this works i'm just gonna use a blow dryer to melt this off of here okay so with just using um a little bit of the blow dryer already started to kind of melt off so i'm gonna just yeah see it's a little sticky just try and like push that off into there so there's the glass in there and it was honestly very difficult to get the rest of the oil out of the cart so i kind of think you just kind of have to go with whatever chunks of broken cart you have and just kind of throw them in there so when i light this i'm just going to light it pretty much just like on the like around the glass like on the other side of it just kind of heat it up and then yeah i'm just going to hit that this looks sketchy as heck oh i got quite a bit out of that okay so let's just take a look at it after it's been smoked yeah it all came off pretty well with just a couple hits so your first step is to figure out um where your wear slash how your cards open so for a lot of them i find um you can twist them off by hand at least the ones i ordered online i find if you have um some grip just this glove here yeah now i can't open it once the camera's on okay there we go so yes that comes out um so just figure out where your cards open i assume they should all be on the top but i can't guarantee you want to put the cart so that wherever they open which for me is the tops of them um is on the bottom so that when all the liquid melts down when we open it it'll be easy to access okay so i just had a bowl of um hot water here and then a shot glass michael jackson and i'm gonna fill up that um shot glass with that hot water and then put it in the bowl with hot water to keep it nice and warm now i'm gonna take my cards and place them um with the tip up so that the distillate will fall to the tip which is where i want it to go and i'm actually just going to pour out enough water so that the um water isn't going into the the uh the part that gets screwed in but just enough to keep most of the distillate warm so it can melt properly and then we're just going to wait for this and as it cools down i'll just reheat it or add um more hot water until all of the liquid in the carts fall down which i think will take about 10 minutes ish okay so the water that i used was not warm enough so you want to make sure this water is really hot almost boiling but not boiling um and then it should take about 10 minutes so there's a couple ways you can consume these and the first would be just straight up eating it so let's start with this cartridge here i'm just gonna dry that off and then i'm gonna twist it open [Music] okay so there is our oil i'm just gonna lick this right off here and because it's really warm it came off really easily super easy to get off and then for the rest of this i'm just gonna take a toothpick and do that and then i'm just going to eat it right off the toothpick and then repeat those steps until i have ate all of this little bit of oil in here it doesn't taste the best it's not gonna lie i find that um oops the um the ones from the dispensaries taste a little better than the ones that i ordered online okay so i got pretty much everything i can get out of this one you can either throw this away or you can refill it with some more distillate and another way to eat it is similar to just eating it but if you kind of want to avoid the taste and are looking for something easy i suggest using oreos now yes these are oreo minis but you could use whatever oreos you like this is just what i had at home so i'm gonna get another cartridge here let's pull up this one isn't that beautiful that's one nice thing about getting your carts from the dispensary they're just much nicer looking much nicer looking and this one here is my favorite it's called spinach and the top part that you uh the mouthpiece it actually moves around let's see if you guys can see that see so yeah most of them don't do that so i really like that okay now we're going to open this one and i need to dry that off again too this one is a lot harder to open and while i'm doing this i'm just tasting the one that i had in my mouth and honestly it leaves a pretty gross taste i don't really love that but if you eat something else that's thick it'll probably um disguise it oh my goodness i could not get this open this is going to be an issue i have a feeling because these are from dispensaries it might be what the heck am i tightening it the wrong way so i really cannot get this one open i don't know what it is so i'm just gonna set it back and i think i'm just gonna break into it um to get the rest of the distillate out but for these oreos i'm gonna use this one to show you guys so it seems like the ones from like i said the ones from the um when you order them online or off the block market or whatever these are very easy to unscrew um but the ones from dispensaries not as much kind of makes sense because they're probably trying to avoid you from using them over again so yeah i'm just again gonna um look whatever's left off here tastes horrible i mean it's not that bad i'm being so dramatic okay and then i'm going to um use the toothpick i just have a fresh toothpick here to get the rest of this out okay so i'll just take that um right out of there and i'm gonna put it right into the middle of my little oreo and close that and then that is good to eat and i'll do the same with the other oreo here and you can put as much or as little as you want oh look at that one right here this one is made to put a whole bunch in there and guys i'm not serving these to people so don't don't be saying how nasty this this looks or is because i'm just eating it myself and then the cooler this gets the harder it's going to be get um to get out so work fast um or just put the screw the lid back on and put it back in some hot water but yeah we got most of that out okay so there's one way to do that and then the other is if you want to um use your carts in anything um that would usually require a infused butter or oil you can do that with this so here i have some melted butter this is just regular butter and then i melted it um and then i'm going to directly add my carts right into here and mix all together i'm also going to add some lecithin in here which is going to help bind the butter to the distillate as well as help our bodies absorb the thc i know some people are going to say do i need lecithin no you do not if you have it use it or if you have the capsules you can break them over and put them in there but you don't need to go out and buy it it should probably be fine on its own and the specific amount doesn't really matter i probably put more than i needed in there but oh well so we're going to add in our carts and all we're going to do is just scrape them into here and mix it really well and then you can use this butter in any recipe that calls for infused butter so the ratios doesn't really matter if you want to put 10 carts in here go put 10 cards if you want to do one cart just do one cart and then say you wanted to make brownies and your brownies call for half a cup of infused butter you can use half a cup of your infused butter so this is really it essentially is the same thing as if you were to add the cart directly to a um say like a batch of brownies but the thing is it would be very hard to distribute that little bit of distillate throughout the whole brownie so by putting it into the butter we're able to get the butter to go throughout all of the brownies instead of just working with you know this much liquid we're working with this much or more so now let's add these ones and so because there's such little left in these in order for me to show you guys how i would actually do this slash how you guys should do this i'm gonna um use this full cart that i haven't used yet and like i said i don't want to use the one i don't want to um inhale the ones that i had ordered online back before so this is a good way to use it so i just heated up a cup of water in the microwave it's almost boiling but not and this came in a package i'm just going to put it right in there and let it actually i'm going to turn it around so that we have the bottom going in first so we can melt this liquid a little bit more so it'll be easier to pour into our butter so i'm going to leave that in there um for a few minutes i just got a comment and say be careful because i've been licking these and like the toothpick and stuff and it gets hitting me hard and i don't know i know i should stop but for the video you know i just want to taste like icings i think i got some oreo icing in it but be careful with how much you use okay this has been been in here for about like five minutes so it should be oh my god it's so hot okay so it should be good if you don't have it doesn't come in one of these bags which i know most don't just put it in a little plastic baggie to be honest it's probably fine to go in without anything but i mean why not use a bag isn't this packaging super cute i love these ones but i don't know i feel weird about using the ones online so i'm just going to open that because i gotta dry it off again there's our brand new cart and i'm gonna open um this part right here and then we're gonna pour all this liquid into our butter that's been melted so this should come out pretty easily because um it was in the hot water melting yeah you can see we got most of that out already okay and then whatever is left which there isn't much um i guess we'll just use a toothpick to get that out but you could use a blow dryer too to kind of push it down but yeah that came out really easy and it was only in the hot water for um like three or four minutes and you know i really don't like the taste of the back of all this like in the back of my throat like as i'm doing this because i've been eating like eating a little bits throughout and it just does not taste good so i really think it'd be nicer with the oreos and stuff so that you can kind of have something i don't know so it doesn't have to like line your mouth and throat it can just go right into your stomach and see now i have um it's all over this and i can't get that into the butter so i'm just gonna have to like suck this off of the toothpick how delicious okay this one doesn't taste as bad kind of tastes like lip gloss cool so now that we have um that poured in we're just gonna mix it into this butter and it's fruit punch flavored flavored i guess scented no i don't know i'm not sure but it doesn't really taste like fruit punch it does when you inhale it but the actual oil doesn't so that mixed in very very well and at this point you can just put it in the fridge and it's good to use in your recipes a nice easy infused butter i think i'm going to um scrape out the rest of my three cartridges and put them in here but because there's such little left in here it might be best to just um scrape it out with a toothpick and just kind of like eat it directly off not right now because honestly i've had too much and i can already tell it's like i'm going down a bad road with how much i've had and it hasn't even been that much but i still have to make dinner and stuff so i got to be capable of doing all that and i don't know about you guys but the one thing that i need to realize i shouldn't do when i'm high is cook because every time i cook when i'm high i mess something up and i'm not type person who usually messes things up when i cook but oh my goodness the nastiest the most gross dish i've ever made or the only like really bad dish the grossest dish i ever made was when i was high it was just i was making oh i don't want to tell you guys it was so gross but yeah so for these cards that i can't open i think i'm just going to straight up break them and do that to get the oil out um so yeah let's try that please tell me if there's a better way to open these because i feel like there must be something or i am just a major weakling and i can't open them i'm just gonna get this out of the way i'm gonna oh god how should i do this i think i'm just gonna like smack it with this oh god i'm so scared yeah okay what the heck there we go okay so i broke that there's the oil and then like i said we could put this without the sticker in um a pipe and use that because it'd be too hard to scrape this off i don't know how many times i'm going to tell you but it really does not taste good in in the mouth i need to go eat something like chewy to get get rid of the taste okay so these pieces i feel like need to go into the pipe so i'll put those there so we got all that there and then i'm gonna get my pipe this honestly feels like the most sketchy ghetto thing ever like literally smoking pieces of glass just be careful if you guys are gonna do this i'm assuming everybody is a grown up with a fully developed brain don't hurt yourself okay and then i'm literally going to smoke this these pieces of glass like a huge sketchy person but it works it really does work surprisingly now we got my glass that i'm about to hit okay let's do this yeah something's sparked so it's just like should i continue doing this you know what i don't suggest smoking the glass okay i did it if you choose to do it it wasn't me who's recommending it so just keep that in mind because that was a little bit sketchy and like what if you lit it up and then uh like glass sparked into your eye you know what i mean okay i'm so scared something's gonna hit my eyes let me just i'm still gonna do it even though i don't suggest it but just give me one second i'm back and i'm protected and i'm ready to try this again actually one second okay now that i got my personal protective equipment i think i'm ready to try this again i'm gonna get rid of that one with a little bit of something else on there i think it was like a sticker or something and let me just yeah there's still a little more there okay very fruit punch not really under the sea under the sea darling gets better down where it's wetter take it from me so the verdict is in and don't smoke glass smoke grass but yeah i took the glass out not a good idea don't do it i mean you can but i do not suggest i'm good [Music] too um um yes thank you guys again very much for watching i hope you enjoyed this video and i apologize if it's all over the place because i'm a little high right now but when i wanted to show you guys in the last like 20 minutes i had let this butter sit out when i was [Music] smoking i don't know what i was doing and this is what it looks like just so you guys can kind of see it has stayed um emulsified uh you guys can't see that too well can you there you go so yeah that's how the butter looks a little a little weird-ish texture but yeah that is just regular unsalted butter one cart and some lecithin mixed it and i'm just gonna go store this in the fridge and then i'm gonna use it maybe to make um some toast tonight perhaps okay guys so to summarize a few different ways we put our distillate directly into our oreos just open them up rub some onto the frosting we melted some butter and poured in some warmed up distillate mixed it together with a little bit of lecithin i know some people are going to say do i need lecithin no you do not if you have it use it or if you have the capsules you can break them over and put them in there but you don't need to go out and buy it it should probably be fine on its own but if you find that you're mixing it together and it's not mixing just put it in the fridge go buy some lecithin and you can always add it later it's not going to hurt anything to add it um a little bit later instead of at the same time thank you guys so much for watching this video i apologize if i am being a little bit confused in any of the video because i've been needing the oil the whole time and it's just like it's hit me and i also was smoking my glass so that hit me real hard um as well speaking of which i do have the rest of mine that i'm going to hit right now but thank you guys very much for watching i hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did please leave a comment give it a thumbs up and subscribe you", "8DVA8ZJaiVc": "[Music] what's up guys p2 peeps and continuing our uh you know fake cartridge exploration we're going to be taking a look at some real fake cartridges so um background on these i have tried these before i have tried uh two of them before and now when the time i tried them uh they were definitely a really cheap price and i was thinking to myself like yeah dude i trust my plug these you know looks great oil looks like a good color and um you know it hits okay and i'm getting i'm getting loaded so it's whatever you know 15 a gram it's cool but uh now that i'm older and wiser i know that's kind of dumb like sure you could trust your plug but dude if you're not actually getting the lab results or anything that's really scanned or verified or you don't or like you know if you know or you don't know i mean if you don't know uh what is inside of the cartridge like you didn't see the person fill it up um then don't trust it that's just the rule of thumb here guys like when it comes to concentrates and um cartridges and things like that you might be thinking no one's got time to fake any of that stuff or whatever whatever but honestly they do got the time people make a killing off of these cartridges off of killing people so just be careful what you put into your body and if you're buying cartridges off the street please make sure that is not any any dank vape stuff or any of those weird you know cartoon graphics on the the box just because someone's got a box that's got like a graphic on it doesn't mean anything so guys um i'll show you guys first the worst looking cartridge of them so this is the uh container they came in this is a clear kings i'm not sure if anyone's ever had a real clear kings or anything like that but if you guys have please let me know down know down below in the comments and you know let me know how that was for you so it says here on the front store at room temperature exposure to direct sunlight may cause cartridge to leak or oil to discolor that's something that i thought was going on with this guys this is the cartridge we're working with you see those black splotches and stuff all around it that's that's not supposed to be there you know we see that the black spot just here down there and um you know let's just take a look at a thickness test i'm just going to turn this to the side look how fast just look how fast that oil is traveling that's not that's not natural for your regular oils yeah grab my cart right here real bear lab stuff look at that nothing it's barely moving on this one but look at that it's already almost separated entirely to the bottom see nothing's moving still from this nothing yet and yet in only about 10 to 15 seconds this is already dripping to the bottom so that's another thing that threw me off about the cartridge you know the color and um how fast it was you know moving down and things like that but when i first got it guys it was not this color it was not this color it was like a golden color so let's read a little bit more here on the label and packaging i'm not sure guys if this brand is exactly like a fake brand or not you know i don't want to call them out because for all i know this could be a real brand that's just uh you know getting getting under fire um or getting copied but yeah see this whole thing has you know all these uh labels and websites and you know warnings and things like that but those are really easy to print on to just about anything nowadays so you can't always trust your plug stuff just because it's got a label like i was saying the ingredients here let's see it says distillate and fractionated coconut oil uh on the ingredients there so um yeah that kind of threw me off so when i was first hitting these their flavor was uh the thing that really stood out to me i definitely tasted that little coconutty flavor so that's why i when i first had these i was thinking these are all right you know these aren't too bad i wish they could have better dirt flavors but you know for a small cart brand this isn't that bad 20 15 a gram that's that's way too cheap you know at the time of course i didn't really think about that so yeah this is definitely not good oil definitely not you want your oil to be thick if your oil is moving around this fast it is not all oil this has definitely been cut with something else and that's why it is super liquidy you know another reason why a cartridge may be super liquidy and move around fast is because it's it might be you know surrounded by a lot of heat things like that but in this case it's about room temperature in here guys i've been keeping this in a drawer this is not this one specifically has not seen any sunlight at all so the fact that it has turned this color is definitely alarming so that was this cartridge this uh wedding cake one and so now we'll take a look at the next cartridge we have from the same brand and uh i'm sure same source this one is a runts cartridge so like i said before it's the same same brand and all that stuff so it should have the same ingredients etcetera etcetera but the surprising thing about this one is i've had these for just about the same time and this one still retains its golden color uh it still looks pretty decent you know um one thing i'll also say guys about uh fake cartridges is the rod size so uh here let's actually do another direct comparison between this one and the bear labs car so as you guys can see this cartridge on the left here is a lot thicker in the rod the middle portion than the cartridge on the right here see the rod on this cartridge right there it it's a lot thinner you know it gets thick to the bottom base here but for the most part your cartridges from the dispensary or legal sources are going to have that a lot skinnier rod and you can see here it's just thick all the way down through there it doesn't really get too big towards the bottom there uh when you see the bottom you know what i mean it gets a little bit wider but not by a bit like by too much where as if you look to here the size of it gets a lot bigger towards the bottom so yeah if you see um cartridges with just rods that are way too big down and you know the ones in the middle that's another sign that you could be dealing with a fake cartridge so these rods uh the thicker rods here allow for less product to be placed in so typically you see these on the street because uh street plugs can just short you easily they can just give you like .75 in a cartridge that's supposed to hold a gram and it'll still look full because uh you know the rod's bigger now one thing i'll say is that sometimes uh oil gets stuck in the wick so when you do buy from dispensaries if something looks like it's a little a little under it's definitely just some stuff that is stuck in the wick of the cartridge so yeah this is the same exact thing you know same exact cartridge except for the oil now let's do the liquidy test here and as you can as you guys can see it's a little bit thicker than the previous one but still that bubble is moving way too fast guys way too fast so if if you're if your oils are doing something like this in just the span of like five to ten seconds i highly suggest you put that [ __ ] down because you have just no idea what's going on with that anymore um so yeah look i know there's some people out there who uh your plug might be your only cartridge source or um you know you might be in a legal state so it's just a lot harder to get legit things but um i just have to encourage you guys to please be safe these could these can like you know fake cartridges can literally kill you or destroy your lungs if you don't want it you know if you don't care whether you smoke more or you know like every day pretty much for the next 20 years then go ahead and smoke more fake cartridges it's definitely gonna bust up your lungs like i said guys i tried two of these i thought it was okay but on my second one i knew something was fishy because my throat was getting scratchy i was coughing on hits like that were not supposed to make me cough you know i was taking small baby hits of a regular flower and that [ __ ] was making me cough my throat was itchy and scratchy for days i wasn't breathing right for a little bit and that was just off a few puffs of a second cartridge so you know i'm one you know wondering what would have happened if i had continued to smoke that cartridge all the way down to the to the end you know some people will smoke their fake carts and feel totally fine and just keep going with it and for those people i mean do you you know i'm just encouraging people to to smoke safe and be safe because at the end of the day when it comes to concentrates people can put whatever they want in it man i'm not saying stay off it's just like you know stop popping off your plug when it comes to you know your meds or whatever do whatever you want um you know flour can be overpriced at the dispensary but when it comes to cartridges and concentrates guys please please try to make sure you know what's getting put in it and you know what where it's being sourced from all that stuff you know you want to know as much as possible about these concentrates because pesticides can slip in there pines i've heard people slipping pine sole into cartridges you know actual cleaner that's like pledges and stuff like that like that's that's crazy that's you know like i said it's poison so once again guys let's take a a final look here the one on the left has all those little weird black splotches and things like that the one on the right still looks totally fine um but again guys the way those bubbles move way too fast so we can do let's do a quick little comparison of the bubbles here um obviously the one on the left is uh traveling a little bit faster because i think the bubble is bigger you know there's less product in there and um another thing is i hit it a bit so maybe it's been heated up a bit and whatever was liquefying uh or you know was liquefied in there is a lot like more uh i don't know the word i'm forgetting it but a lot more movable but yeah i'm definitely not going to be trying any of these guys i'm really only holding onto these for reference so yeah i hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did please leave a like comment subscribe and i'll be you know talking more about fake cartridges as time goes along answering questions uh dropping more knowledge that i know about them and things like that but uh yeah this was a good thing for i guess people who would want to know from an eye test how to tell if their cartridge is uh fake or at least how to know if i should be a little suspicious about it so yeah

gram", "bcvJBXr6bSU": "[Music] what is going on youtube it's your boy turpatom coming right back with you guys with a nice awesome medical cannabis review and this one i'm going to be doing a dislike cartridge durbin poison you guys know durbin poison is one of my favorite sativas right so as soon as i get out back in my little spot we're going to get straight into this derby poison the cartridge all right i'll see you right back so like i was saying this desolate durban poison grass root cartridge half a gram i believe it was uh 50 bucks and it was like 15 off i believe yesterday on their their sales they had so uh look at the numbers here guys real quick hopefully it focuses for you right you know i'll do my little zoom in thing give you guys all that nice info all right you guys remember uh it's a south african land race variety right uh energetic uplifted happy euphoric and creative well it's supposed to help the stress depression inside chronic pain muscle cramps and uh fatigue a similar strange like i was saying is jack hair super lemon haze ghost train haze uh j1 jack the ripper j or xj13 and clementine all right so i got my nice [ __ ] ooze stainless steel battery here i'm gonna hook this on it should be nicely freshly charged um there it is unopened all right let me get the sticker off um i haven't had a distillate cartridge for a minute um i mean if you consider co2 cartridges distillate then i guess that's a dislike cartridge but yeah i haven't had this cartridge in a minute so let's see hopefully the headspace is [ __ ] minimum probably won't be uh that's a [ __ ] man dude look at that headspace that is just crazy i feel like i get raped every time and i buy from them at least it's not 60 dollars for the [ __ ] sauce guard i guess i mean but still 50 dollars for a dislike cartridge bro i like the color on it but grassroots y'all really gotta gotta do something with this and i see that you actually changed the plugs up here so i'm sure it's going to be yes a hell of a lot easier so thank you for thank you for changing the plugs up on these things because my last video uh maybe the last few videos of the the uh grassroots cart like this i had a hard time getting this little piece out so thank you for that but man that headspace that headspace is just craziness like come on guys all right my dog's gonna bark so i'm stopping and i'll get married the head space yeah i'm really disappointed in this head space here guys i mean you're spinning 50 bucks even at 45 for a half a gram it should be [ __ ] full you know what i mean that is that's just it's just ridiculous it should be full i'm out back guys i'm sorry i can't i can't help the dogs bark in it and stuff like that uh it is what it is right but yeah let's hook this guy up to the [ __ ] battery and uh give it a go first i'm gonna do a dry test like normal all right it has that it has that super lemon that like uh lemon sweet a taste to it that taste word just wouldn't come out of my mouth there so yeah here we go once again thank you shout out to mark and uh young crews thank you boys here we go cheers that is definitely tasty you could really taste the lemon in this one guys this is really tasty and i was i was really expecting the distillate um the distillate tastes like like straight up um i really wouldn't say like a burnt cartridge taste but most thistles kind of have that burnt cartridge taste at least in my opinion it does right and this one does not have that burnt cartridge taste right now and for being distilled that's really good like i said this is a pure [ __ ] sativa guy so this is a good one for the morning it's a good one to smoke when you want to get stuff done yard work uh on a job site whatever it is and you got to get some [ __ ] done this is a good one to have on deck like i said they're really convenient they're really uh you know sneaky you know what i mean like like the smell on it on this one the smell is going to be like like lemon hazy kind of a smell sent to it don't smell like weed at all so i really love it i love these things and with the ooze batter it's nice slick too so uh if you can make sure you guys go pick up one of these nice slick batteries i think they're like 12 bucks 17 like that and they got the adjustable uh things too so i'm actually going to turn it up a little bit at 3.8 and start at 3.3 i'm going 3.8 and give this one a a hit a little hotter and see if i could get a little more uh terpene taste out of it let's go cheers all right so i had more of the lemon taste and had a little earthy taste as well uh so i'm guessing the hotter you get the more terpenes you kind of bring more to taste out and distill the carts some cartridges are opposite the less heat you have the more taste you have uh yeah so for for being a distillate cartridge after hitting it two times i would definitely call this one a win like i said i'm not happy with the headspace and uh normally most grassroots cartridges have that headspace it just the [ __ ] is there i mean what can you do about it you know what i mean besides [ __ ] about it and hopefully they fixed it they fixed a little cap issue so that's cool but yeah man i'm um thank you grassroots this one isn't too bad for being adjusted to the cartridge the taste is good the effect is good as you tell me i feel like i'm just just chit chatting away my eyes definitely feel a little low but they're always [ __ ] low right uh because you know your boy turbo tom stays turkey stays medicated uh 99 of time besides when i'm at work now with this new job but yeah anyway uh mama i love you guys make sure you smash that like if you want to leave a donation you guys know in venmo uh smash that like share subscribe all that good stuff yourself up money's durbin poison grass root this with the cartridges you won't be disappointed i'm telling you for being desolate you won't be [ __ ] disappointed alright peace out",

New Zealand they're gonna work on that little by little a backward or a pack with a pack wood is it's two grams of designer weed wrapped in a backward with a huge glass tip then distant oil then rolled in Keith that [ __ ] is crazy hey don't count on Donald to do that oh you see that shirt Oh F society s society yeah I blasted - hey everything in this world has good and bad everything in this will has good and bad listen I never been a president and I don't know what it is like to be a president or what it takes to be a president so I'm not here to judge nobody I can tell you my personal opinion in that session but that's all it'll ever be is my personal opinion I hate when the average Joe starts pointing at the president like look what he's doing you know what he should be doing and I'm like yeah you you [ __ ] you gonna tell the president what to do you gonna tell the president how to run this country you you work at Safeway it's a [ __ ] out of here well [ __ ] deliver pancakes for a living you gonna talk about you know what the president should do I can't shut the [ __ ] up I don't know what the president should do people crazy now everybody everybody everybody has conspiracy theories do I believe in I don't believe in conspiracy theories if I believe in something is because I took the time to look it up and do the fact check and I made sure that it was right before I said I'm gonna believe it so I don't believe in theories I believe in facts hey Bush Bush did some stuff so he did some good stuff ain't you some bad stuff but let me tell you like this they never ever ever ever ever in the history of presidents never let me tell you again never in the history of presidents has there ever been a president that everyone liked so don't don't think that's gonna [ __ ] ever happen imagine the shock an entity somebody did it like them straight up you gotta keep that in your mind people need to stop thinking that all this [ __ ] is new this a man the only thing that is new is that everybody could be heard that's the only thing that's new that's why it seems like there's so much anger or so much hate extra going on no it's not that there's extras that everybody has a microphone now so they're gonna be [ __ ] hurt but [Music] you crazy if you think of everybody like Obama are you crazy you know how many racist people are in America couldn't stand a man he was one of the most hated presidents ever it man cost so much slack that [ __ ] was crazy [ __ ] Lincoln freed the slaves and they still shot that [ __ ] in the back of the head alright Isaiah yeah man think about it there has never been a president that everyone liked it just nah but she ain't gonna exist you gonna make everybody happy [Music] there's no way [Music] he said the white man that the rich man let me tell you that that whole white man black man everything all that that's all an illusion that's how an illusion that she was created to keep rich people rich and poor people poor only poor people argue about color and race rich people don't argue about this without Zen yeah I chased [Music] let me explain to you why let me explain to you why first of all Steve I understand white and black the fight between white and black was created as an illusion you know it's an illusion because white is not a racist black is not a race so for two people that hate each other there are white and black 11 an illusion there's no such thing both things do not exist none of them exist it's not a thing not real it doesn't exist it's an illusion there is no white and there is no black everybody has a country everybody has a place where they're from all white people are separated into many many many varieties of different whites from all over the place there are super light-skinned blue-eyed Spanish people everywhere so it's never been about light-skinned or dark skins or your hair or none of that [ __ ] it's an illusion to make you believe that that exists and that you should hate it it's not even real it's an illusion it's fake none of that [ __ ] is real [Music] now don't get me wrong I don't want you to think that I'm against races because I think that we all should believe in our own race and we should all believe in our own culture and we should all understand where we come from and who we are I don't believe in that whole we're all humans and we're all the same that is [ __ ] do not ever believe that we are not all the same that is a [ __ ] false reality if you think that [ __ ] we are not all the same we are the same parts we're not all the same and it's our differences that make us beautiful that's what makes us amazing that's what makes us incredible to look at to each other because you are different and than me so it makes things exciting to see the differences but the minute you start to believe that we're all the same you start to lose focus of what we truly are who we truly are you lose all that [ __ ] don't lose that Jeff poster is what separates us but that separation is good it's not a bad thing we were taught to believe that separate is bad and that we should all be one look at all the problems we have today and it's because the average person doesn't even understand their own culture their own being their own place on this planet they're trying to live in this makeshift created digital world not even real what up Anthony no weed makes you think wheat is knowledge because it makes you think we smoke a man we discuss some things so that's all a false reality but you have to embrace your coach your friends you have to know where you're from know your people know who your original people are know their stories just to make you a much stronger human being on earth to know that stuff not to just be alive and be like oh you know um don't I don't consider myself a race I'm just a person you're the your what does that even mean like what do you mean then what do you mean you're nothing you're you're a flake of nature you don't even exist you're just a a piece of the wind just passing by you're attached to nothing you matter nowhere you know I'm saying attach this up to a to a culture attach yourself to a people be something you know be part of something gigantic [Music] yes it's okay to dislike there's no problem to not like something or to not like people or to not like whether you know it's no problem that's not an issue the problem is people acting violently according to their dislikes that's a problem but there's nope it shouldn't be a problem for someone to say I'm not interested in that I don't like it at all and I'm not with it and that should be okay as long as that person that is that is not acting violent towards those other people it should be alright but the problem is the violent part people think that they should act violent towards [ __ ] that they don't like that's the crazy [ __ ] [Music] I should be able to say oh no no no no no I don't know no I don't like that I don't like that at all and everybody should be like hey that guy doesn't like this hey that's okay but in today's day if you say no no no no no no no I don't like that get that away from me people will lose their [ __ ] you'll be [ __ ] up you are forced to like everything even if you don't like it you have to openly say I like that I'm cool with that because if you don't say that you're gonna get [ __ ] crucified on [ __ ] all over the world your life could come to an end tonight just by saying no I don't like that [ __ ] man you got to live for the moment but understand your path to your patch is part of a concession of us a billion zillion moments so don't lose your identity on the fact that you're enjoying the moment gotta love the moment yes but understanding yes you're a part of a grand scheme of things so always pay attention to the big picture never forget that there there are other people around you live life how you want to but don't be a dick you know nobody knows how big the universe is it's impossible to mathematically equate some people so they can sound smart they answer that question and they say this is how big we think the universe is the [ __ ] out here you know who knows what the universe even is we have no idea what the [ __ ] universe even is nobody knows what the [ __ ] it is we just know that there are planets there are solar system there are stars there's a bunch of [ __ ] all there but nobody knows what it all is together what what is it why is it there what's it here for what's it doing no one knows yeah I'm trying to tell you I was talking about that before drive where I mentioned that um maybe that that's a big possibility on why aliens don't [ __ ] uh communicate with us maybe they don't even acknowledge us as smart or is something that should be communicated with maybe they're just walking by us the way you walk by a squirrel every day was the last time you saw a squirrel and felt the need to have a conversation with it when was the last time you saw an ant and tried to intelligently contact the ant when was the last time you sat in front of a big-ass pile of ants and try to communicate with it you don't do that why because you know that the minute you try to communicate with those ants those ants are gonna [ __ ] you up with no hesitation maybe that's how aliens view Earthlings and they're like that you don't don't [ __ ] touch those like your mom would tell you you go to the park don't don't touch those red ants they'll [ __ ] you up maybe all aliens are taught that [ __ ] don't don't don't touch humans don't you [ __ ] try to communicate with humans they will [ __ ] you up are you crazy you're tripping don't you touch one of those [ __ ] humans ain't nasty but if that's the case what if we're all afraid for nothing the same way ants are afraid of for nothing you know just like bees yeah if you go to a bee's nest you can mean no harm all you want to do let's say let's say you intelligently wanted to walk over to the business with no intentions of harm at all and you wanted your best to try to communicate with the bees no my friend no that is not gonna pan out well not at all within seconds you will be swarmed and devoured by thousands of [ __ ] bees and they would [ __ ] you up so bad so bad so maybe aliens feel the same way about humans maybe they just passed by like don't you know don't you [ __ ] touch those things ooh those things are sharp they'll [ __ ] you up so fast and like mom can I take one home no no no no don't do that they'll send a whole bunch more looking for it in their [ __ ] saw look don't you [ __ ] bring that type of drama through my [ __ ] house you better leave that thing right there and now picture this right picture yourself as a child and you see you see a little lizard right you see a little lizard or a turtle or something that you consider to be a cute animal and you grab this lizard and you pick it up and you examine the lizard and you check it out and you might hold onto it for a while you might put it into a box you might [ __ ] take it home with you and show it to a whole bunch of [ __ ] friends there's a little lizard right there's a little lizard and it's in your box and you're showing it to the world and you're keeping it as a pet for a little bit and maybe before you go home tonight maybe your mom says to you what's in that box and you're like nothing and she's like what in the box and you're like nothing she's like let me see and you show her she sees the lizard she says put that thing [ __ ] back where you found it right so you take the lizard where you found it and you drop it off sad and you go back home now did it ever cross your mind how did that affect that lizard is that lizard now going around to his lizard buddies talking about aliens took me they took me with them they probed me they checked me out they did a bunch of [ __ ] and they brought me back maybe maybe not yes it could be just that simple it could be that simple why aliens don't communicate with humans why do we see them in the sky why do we see signs of their existence but why don't they communicate with humans maybe for the same reason you're walking through a [ __ ] you walking through the woods you will not try to communicate with a pack of wolves what are your chances that that conversation with that pack of wolves is gonna work out well what are the chances not much as a matter of fact it's probably so close to zero it's astonishing think about it like this what would ants need to do to get your attention what would ants need to do to get your attention so that you can say wait a minute they deserve to be communicated with and how long after understanding that they're intelligent do you treat them as an equal when do you start treating ants as your equal just because they can communicate with you now you know yeah but do you still treat them as equals just because they could spell out letters what would they need to do to gain your respect besides going to war and taking their respect what would they need to do [Music] if ants I'm gonna tell you right now if ants were any bigger we'd be [ __ ] I'm trying to tell you if if ants were the size of let's say not even let's say cats if ants we're the size of cats humans most likely won't even exist the evaporation of humans would probably happen overnight yup if ants were the size of mice you have fire ants the size of mice dumb [ __ ] would destroy the planet overnight there's something like four I could be wrong a hundred percent but it is something like four million ants to every person yeah yeah it'll be it'll be catastrophic you know humans ain't that crazy humans ain't that crazy we're not that far off we've only got several hundred years of real serious technical technological you know advancements the rest of the thousands of years have been human advancements you'd wake up cants would carry you away in a heartbeat you see people being carry carried away by ants everywhere that's beside the point you know the point is about that about communication you know even even if you see strength even if you see intelligence even if you see signs of real life titled intelligent life at what point do you feel that they're your equals so you can communicate with them we do acknowledge that there are a lot of really really intelligent animals on this planet we still kill them the [ __ ] off with no problem so at what point do you recognize them as equals so that they could live harmonically you know [Music] all right George art Oh baby please yeah man that's the craziness the craziness is that scientists if you look at scientists this is the problem I'm gonna tell you what the problem is with scientists that that talk about subjects like this online and on TV you know documentaries you know the huge problem with these scientists is that they always always always give aliens human intelligence you know when these people talk about aliens they always think that aliens think the way we think that they do things the way we do things so that's why a lot of things to them don't make sense because they feel that they answer everything in the sense that in the way that human would do stuff so this is why a lot of scientists don't have any understanding of [ __ ] like that because they always always always think aliens are going to have the same type of intelligence and understandings that we have and that's not true at all they can have a different viewpoint of everything and not even look at us the way we're looking at things right now they can look at us as whatever you know who knows who knows what their viewpoint and their understandings are maybe they have no need to communicate the way we do we have a need to communicate and talk and you know balance ourselves with others but maybe they don't maybe they have no [ __ ] need to communicate with us at all they just do [ __ ] around us with no thought about us we don't even across their mind that's I'm trying to tell you like the same way you walk by pigeons on the street the same way you walk by a cat you care about like you're just gonna keep walking there's somebody Blake did you see that cat over there like okay exactly didn't even cross your mind that there was a [ __ ] cave in this yeah it's creepy

before humans where ever that the number one creature on the planet so with that being said depends on how you study your history and how you're looking to the past you'll find out what's real what's

friends that brings us to the end of this smoked out tonight", "PxL8RgmvK3I": "hey what's up guys what did do is you boy mr. bling see I'm coming back at you with another video I think I just cringed after I said that but uh anyway today I wanted to just talk about some carts uh in specific fake carts because like I've been watching a lot of other people's videos on like your views of carts and [ __ ] and anytime they review something that's like a dank vape or a dab wood or like a cereal cart all I see in the comments are over you smoking home to fake cards oh you've got no food carts oh that car doesn't have the holo graphics on it so I think that fake um I would like to just say shut the [ __ ] up cuz like I'm pretty sure everyone who smokes carts knows that all of these aren't real carts because I mean it's pretty obvious if you smoke them yourself you can get different packaging which are like fake our carts from a fake cart in general but just starting off this video all of these carts are fake these two are real though I'm just gonna show you the packaging on these real quick so first off they have the California label and that's something only some of these fake car companies can write or copy onto their packaging but uh anyway you have a sticker that clearly labels your total THC and CBD content your strain how many milligrams you're getting and what type of weed it is you have this sticker label on the top that seals the box you have this sticker label on the back that lists your THC and CBD again and a government warning all of this information is on this legit kingpin packaging even the way the packaging it comes in obviously I mean like these are long since weak but uh you get a nice little kingpin cart it looks very nice it's all high quality you can open it in case you want to take the wax out it's a legit kingpin cart it even has the like the label a you can't scratch off I just hit my camera mess up my then I think it was a shame all right so you have all of these other companies that are making black-market cards all of these are black-market cards the thing is it's just some companies do it better than others and I don't know why some companies decide to lie about what they're putting in the curt's like trap house they put a rough percentage of your THC content they put all natural high percent organic no PG VG or PE d and they even copy the California sticker the thing is trap house is an alleged company and so these aren't real cards they're fake cards but they're high-quality fake cards if I would say so myself I just finished their Venice og one and like the waxen this was just as good if not better than the wax and these kingpin cards don't hate to kingpin though these were nice um but yeah so like just because it's a car is fake doesn't mean that it's not gonna work the thing is these are full of harmful chemicals not full of them but like Oh some more but these are pure wax they're not gonna harm you these though even though they say they don't have PG or VG they do they're mixed with that it's real wax but it's mixed to dilute it in therefore you get more use out of it the way you can tell if it's a higher quality fake wax is if it moves slowly and if it's like a deep golden color or like yeah a deep golden brown um I think out of all of these carts the worst one I've had was this chronomaly skittles cart obviously the packaging is fake I never seen Khurana play anywhere else it doesn't even have like the fake California label on it oh yeah it does but it's like an even weirder one they always say lab tested on percent organic but they're not like it's very obvious when you're hitting these cards that they are mixed with something some of them here really harsh dank babes as you can see his had to change sorry about that I had to fix my camera back because I'm sort of hit it while I was trying to talk about these dang babes packaging um what I was trying to say was dank babes has had to change their packaging three times since January because other people are now taking their packaging and putting fake tarts inside of already fake cart packages which is such an insane thought to me but it's kind of good that dank vapes likes to like at least change up the way that they're selling theirs think their stuff so that people are at least getting somewhat higher quality wax under thinning that I like another thing that I like about dang vapes is that you can't open these see cell atomizers that they use for their wax they're stuck closed and that's a good thing because the fact that all of these companies mix actual THC like weed wax with VG and PG it makes it harmful for you if you take it out of the cart when you're smoking it in the car it'll make you coffee cuz it's kind of harsh it might taste really good but it's still not that great for you imagine that but worse if you take and open these car packages and then you try to actually dab the wax from them Auto break some of these companies make it so that you can unscrew the top of their carts you can refill them obviously but then you can also take the wax out and that's where you can run into problems once you burn the wax that's mixed with VG and PG on a rig it can be super harmful for you because we're not supposed to be combusting those chemicals they're used in actual vape juice that you would mix with nicotine for people to stop smoking they're not meant to be used for THC cartridges obviously you can use them and people are but I feel like people should just put out the information that yes these are fake yes they do work but you have to at least also be careful with them and know what you're getting yourself into before you start trying to like just smoke cards out of the blue and thinking that all of these these are legit I'm pretty sure even exotic like their wax is around the same quality as dank vapes I'm not sure if they're super legit but I know that their wax is not like an amazing quality wax it's decent but it's not great these trap house cards they are pretty good I would suggest them just as highly as I would suggest at King pen but only with the information that these are mixed with VG and that they can harm you and I think like my basic opinion is that these cards while they are fake are just as good as legit carts as long as you know hey I'm sort of damaging my body by using these and you just continue with the information in mind if you can get legit carts I would highly suggest doing that because while they may not like get you as high as these like immediately you might take me need to take a few more hits but these also last longer they're more healthy for you and I mean the smoke is super smooth so it doesn't feel like I was harming myself at all when I was using these cards these carts are probably cheaper and more available to you so if that's your like only choice try some of them out but like try to figure out what brands you prefer over the ones that are like sort of harmful um I feel like this video ended up being a bit of a ramble I'm sorry about that but I also hope that if you did watch you enjoyed and um yeah I'll just catch you all next time see you", "ZTgKBViXyx0": "youtube what is up cushy here and we have the most expensive cartridges uh in pa medical right here uh hundred dollars apiece for these cartridges uh they're one gram um but we're gonna uh open them up and try them on see if they're worth a hundred dollars make sure you guys hit that like subscribe and hit that bell and make sure you uh if you want to legalize medical marijuana make sure you hit that subscribe button you guys rock here we go so this one here i already did open uh i've been smoking on it i love it it's a great great great great sativa rhythm is a great company uh there you go picture of the cartridge from rhythm nice liquid don't move at all straight uh nice thick thick stuff throw it on the battery here like so like i said i've been using this one a little bit so i mean it does have uh some out of it but then we have this one here this is the gelato from alera this one is also a hundred dollars but they even bling this one out for you it has a golden blinged out uh cartridge and i did take a couple hits it was full so i mean it was fuller than that but i just figured i'd do uh the most expensive cartridges uh video but oil looks good it's a little lighter than the other stuff and to be honest with you i always thought the lighter stuff was better but i'm starting to think the darker is better i don't know but yep let's give this guy a try we'll flip his camera around and uh try these babies out now this one here is what i don't like you need a big battery for uh you need either a push button battery with a big high voltage or something like this a yo can to make this thing hit to its uh proper proper capacity because it has these air holes in the cartridge that are kind of a pain in the butt but like i said if you get a big battery uh it's not even a problem all right screw this on all right we got both cards hooked up and ready to go all right we'll start with the rhythm here this is lost coast travel diesel 1 gram 86 it's like almost 87 thc boom rhythm great company great cartridges they're half grams or a little a lot of head space in them this one here was pretty full i was really happy with it uh this has been three days now four days i had this and it's still a good bit left so i mean i'm liking how long they last it's really good oh whoa has a great uh citrusy flavor instantly three seconds in you feel it very good cartridge is it worth a hundred dollars no but very good cartridge love the taste of that lost coast travel diesel okay round two a second hundred dollar cartridge this is a gelato from alera gelato and then we'll give you the boom again like i said you need a good push battery for one of these so we've got the yo cam plus here make sure she's on she's on and here we go gelato is my favorite strain another 100 cartridge right here uh here we go that thing rips oh that gelato man i like it i really like that gelato i bought the 0.5 for like 45 or whatever it was 50 bucks uh this one here i got it for fifty dollars it was on sale i got it on a discount so i wouldn't pay a hundred dollars for these cartridges at all they're i mean they're worth it they're one grams but sell them for 85. come on give us a deal uh we should be 60 but then we go here this is the hundred dollar one here and uh like i said this one here i paid 86 for after the deals so i really didn't pay the hundred dollars for them but i did pay for them uh i don't know if they're on sale at a good price i would buy another one but i can't spend 100 on a cartridge you guys rock like subscribe hit that bell love you hey them [ __ ] got me dumb litter", "HPeCUvEf2XA": "I have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually I've been smoking on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up its up everybody youtubes and really busting my balls about their Community Guidelines recently so if you're under 18 [ __ ] off thanks oh yeah what is going on everybody and welcome back to another episode of free [ __ ] / I've been asked this question like a million times over the past couple days because of my most recent video so knock him out both in one episode you know what I mean before we get to that this video is sponsored by my goddamn self so a lot of you guys have been asking for merch specifically merch that doesn't say hey I'm a [ __ ] pothead on it because I understand that right you guys are like yo man I'd like to merch I want to support you but I don't want a pot leaf on my back and I respect that so just for you people I've dropped a piece drip tea it's pretty much the peace tea that we did before it says peace right here on the breast and then a peace sign on the back but it's like dripping it's like liquidy it looks really cool it's probably only gonna be available for two weeks let's make it two weeks so if you guys want to check that out link is in the description make sure to check it out by yourself one two weeks very limited they're [ __ ] awesome doesn't really scream that you smoke weed and yeah pretty cool so ever since I released that video a couple days ago which by the way he's doing very well the most common question that I get asked is Erik if you're not smoking these boo fast carts then what are your favorite cartridges if you know anything about the channel you know that these have been pretty much my go-to for the past couple weeks couple months I don't even know how long but it's usually the Moonrock carts which this one's empty and thus tizzy I found that these two right here are kind of the cleanest high and they give you the best high for sure like one or two hits out of these I'm not gonna lie that I've tried plenty of carts have tried kingpins brass knuckles like legitimate kingpins legitimate brass knuckles and there's a whole bunch of different brands out there for the most part it takes you like what two three hits and then you're like all right now I'm feeling good but with either of these with one solid not even a blinker with one solid hit like five six seconds I'm feeling it and that's that's kind of tough to do with a pen for me right cuz you tolerance just goes higher and higher and higher after every time I'm not sure how much is left in here it's a strawberry Nana car it's pretty much done tastes very good no best thing about cz see like a not a lot of pins make me cough bro I'm not gonna lie after a hit like that but the thing about susie that doesn't make you my daily driver is one it's only available in california and to its proprietary little battery so if this dies i don't have any other device but i have like a million 510 thread battery so that's mainly why this is nice don't get me wrong and they recently remodeled other package its new packaging it's higher THC percentages and there's no pesticides so sissies your thing then go ahead and check it out man but because of those two things it really just i don't really hit it every day you know i mean i don't get the opportunity to smoke bcz every single day however alright the game has changed man dr. zodiac who usually makes the moon rock cartridges said [ __ ] that i want to branch into other things [ __ ] the moon rocks and we got ourselves i'm not sure he's coming out with anymore but we have ourselves six different cartridges six different flavors six different strains from dr. zodiac himself the maker of the moon rocks and they hit the same bro and it takes a lot for me to say that about a cartridge bro there's not many cards out there that hit like a moon rock car but from the [ __ ] himself obviously it's gonna be pretty dope man have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually i've been smokin on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up i actually gave Kyle one of them which is why one of them is missing so it gives me an opportunity to open it up so packaging is on point first of all you have some crazy I there's so much going on right here there's like a lion's a spaceship in the background there's like a little spiral galaxy right there like this is tight I've got to open it up and inside you'll see a battery a charger and your one gram cartridge I think they also sell them in half grams yeah yeah I've never seen him in half grams but there's a little spot right there for a half gram so I imagine that they do now the [ __ ] cartridges a low charger and we have ourselves right here what is this one the Lion Heart clear so a lot of these don't have the strain actually on them I'm not exactly Lionheart distrain I've never heard of it but the other ones I'll go through and tell you what I think this train is but I guess that's part of the fun man little guessing game so very first hit off of this cart by the way as you can see right here we got a little bubble right there and as you guys know I said in my last video I said hey the bubble moves it's bunk so let's go ahead and see if that bubble is moving I'm not even seeing it but I know the bubbles not moving beautiful beautiful man let's go ahead and just give this a nice low trip blinker yeah we'll get a nice rip and then we'll give it a blinker [Music] goddamn bro [Music] [Music] I couldn't even blink it man okay mm-hmm so I'm not gonna lie Lionheart was my least favorite which is why I gave it to Kai but after that hit man I don't know I might have to reconsider lion-hearted clear very fire next one up I think we're going to go through for my favorite to least favorite right now just as we got that one out of the way my very very favorite out of the six new ones that he has is called this Linwood lemonade clear this pen right here straight up tastes like I'm taking a [ __ ] dab bro it's ridiculous like it tastes so much like lemon like I have lemon gene aemon's right now and I think it kind of reminds me of that but every time I rip this it's flavor town and it's high town baby [Music] that's not saying that's insane man I can literally rip these off a pro I mean that would probably be really bad my tolerance but dude god damn I'm eyes and look [ __ ] all right yeah Lin would absolutely fired next up we have a Bobby blues clear which I believe is Blue Dream or something of the sort tastes very much like Blue Dream and it is the second most delicious one oh yeah that's blue dream for sure next up we have the silverback clear which i think is the best look and artwork in my opinion it's my third favorite and this is guerrilla glue like I said these are just assumptions I could be completely flow going wrong about all these but this is this is generally what I'm tasting what I'm getting the effects that I'm getting from these pants man every single pen also has the little logo or the little artwork on it instead of the little doctor zodiac bunny but we do have the bunny right there and we got the bunny right there as well mad goddamn I love these bro I don't know there's just a look about these you know I mean like every single cart looks the [ __ ] same man and at a certain point like when you're getting really high off all the cards still you look for a little something extra right you look for a little pizzazz you look for a little like all the cards are the same I need something that stands out oh wow all right that second hit was a little different hang on that might bump up man I don't know that might bump up to number two right there goddamn that silver bag is why you're next up this could actually this is up there man I'm not gonna lie next up we have the razzle dazzle clear there's a little berry hitting a cartridge right there which is very clean this color is nice I don't know there's something cool about all these like it's one thing to color one things the flavor when things like the plugins and say you should make it I don't know man one's a real bright pink with all the colors on it I think this one really reminds me of an actual moon rock cardiguez which is like a berry flavored moon rock art tastes very similar to that it honestly tastes like a DAB like I don't know man like not a lot of dab cards sometimes dab cards will just be Tudor P if that makes any sense like oh dude this doesn't even taste like weed this just tastes like like a [ __ ] candy cart or something you know what I mean and I don't really [ __ ] with that but these have like it taste like wheat like you know you're getting that wheat I don't know if all of you are under that there's probably gonna be some people that bro I just smoked with a flavor like alright these cards aren't for you then I'm not gonna lie these cards are for getting extremely [ __ ] medicated and a hint of flavor that's like enjoyable but not too much I don't know but it's some good stuff now this last one here is called Frosty's snowcone again don't necessarily know if that's strain or not um but this little it's a little Frosty the Snowman guys looking evil on here what is he I like that a little logo man it's looking [ __ ] cool there's color by the way purple is probably my favorite color like probably a lighter shade of purple is my favorite color but this is solid right here Wow okay wait I feel like I'm cleansing my palette between each of these hits it's kind of a long time and usually on the streams I'm just like so I'm getting a decent amount of time to actually taste these do why is it so [ __ ] hard to rank these bro that's unnecessary like these are all fire five had however much these retail for like fifty sixty seventy bucks I don't know how much I I wouldn't pick one [ __ ] wait hang on if I had people are gonna ask me but they're like dude I only have enough money for one which one should I buy hey I think I'm buying the lemonade yeah that's a no-brainer I think the lemonade ones like no-brainer no-brainer kind of number one there and then number two bro it's like but just pick your poison yeah I mean goddamn everyone's probably gonna ask for this part no we're okay there you go durability tests on the spot [ __ ] beautiful everyone's gonna ask for it Oh first of all we need to get this thumbnail hang on let's get a bang and ask them no going right now oh not today son not [ __ ] today try to do this on stream and it was rather difficult so we're gonna see what's good right here it's just a little difficult because like it's hard to create a seal around so when you're inhaling you're just getting a lot of air all right so if you're not in a state where you can get dr. zodiacs and Moonrock cartridges and you're like damn I still want to have a little so wanna have a little swagger so we'll have a little what are your favorite batteries Eric I can get my own cartridges what do you like to smoke the actual cars use em so great great move question bro I actually have a little something right here it's like a part to a cliche bro personally I like batteries that don't have a button I don't know what it is but like yeah it's an added luxury that you can change the temperature but give a foot most of the time like I just want to hit it take out of my pocket inhale put it in and then we're good you know I mean I have to like click five times turn on and then like one two three and like change the temp and then like all right you know I mean it's just like those added seconds it seems like some [ __ ] but it kind of matters I mentioned this battery and all of these batteries made by Batman on a video before they're on the one gram in one sitting video but their website only sells wholesale they only sell like two dispensaries and stuff you know what it means so you couldn't buy it individually however I've helped you out don't even worry about it we have found an online head shop that was willing to work with us they even gave us a discount code so head up J vape industries it'll be in the description down below and you can use code Eric 10 for 10 percent off I have this battery and all of the magic Bab ballad batteries they're [ __ ] late all right I got you guys don't worry I got you guys take the lemon one of course slide in there and they both have this magnet [ __ ] that's like I don't know why that's so sexy like I don't know why I meant these are both the same color - damn in here I like this little midnight look look that's not coming out man you got a oh you know what I mean like that's [ __ ] tight you don't getting the only gripe on the see cell palm that I like the VAM on better is obviously this one's smaller this one that's a light so you know when you're heating it you know what I mean this one oh there is a light on this one never mind [ __ ] I don't know man look bad the stick one might hit a little harder than this I'd say if you're buying a dr. zodiac pen and you got the battery with it there's no need to upgrade but if you in need of a new battery these are the movement especially if you don't have a proper battery and you have one of those stick low eight dollar ones at the local smoke shop get rid of that [ __ ] it's gonna die in like a month month and a half get either one of these batteries men Eric 10 for 10% off by the merch first but like a if you want to check these out too if you need a battery a go ahead and check them out man I hope you all enjoyed hope you all learn something this wasn't a drugs 101 I don't know why I said that but like I don't learn something about batteries or card in my favorites hey you know what I mean let's get let's get a solid little double hit here going both batteries actually get something cool willing you know yeah when you have three you can actually like hit it properly you know what I mean I'm like yeah look at this cloud that I made my opponent it's just like alright you won't turn it so I have to do it like this I got to hold it that's gonna be the video guys I hope you

all right Cheers hmm upon foes ripping tasting a little sweet there's a little sweet not like this is actually perfectly placed but uh actually has some skittles here the aftertaste yes it does have an aftertaste of skittles but when I first tasted it it tasted not necessarily like skittles tasted like something else some other type of candy but I just can open up my finger on it uh give me a second and I'll be right back with my analysis on this one folks excuse me whoa okay so yeah if you couldn't nobody tell it hit me kind of hard it is a strong vape yes but for me I would have to give it see I was just gonna be straight-up copy nice I'll give it a seven reason reason why is because as I've stated countless times over and over again is indica and indicas are mainly for calming and going to sleep so uh I mean it still look good beep don't get it twisted don't get it misconstrued in any way this is still a fantastic bait but with the indica it's just eventually you're gonna get you to that point where either you're going to be in max chill mode either chillax mo or like I like to call it chill max but feel like that em in the the eminent oil kind of clash whatever I'm rambling match chill that's mode or sleep I'm not trying to go to sleep match selects mo I don't really care for that but it's not really too much I can really say on here honestly the aftertaste as I said it tastes like skittles the beginning tastes you kind of get that earthy piney woody taste but it's good as good as good let me know down in the comment section below what taste you got from skittles because I feel like just because it's a hundred percent wouldn't know just 100 percent does to it it just will have that piney taste you know because it has no solvent in it let me see something I was trying to test to see if I could unscrew this but I can't and I'm not gonna apply too much pressure and then it actually breaks cuz I've had that happen once well I tried to unscrew a vape and it literally broke in my hands yeah so it seems legit only reason I said it's because I was doing some research on TKO because I haven't had him before and apparently now they do the full disposables was like the the pen and battery attached but it also said that there are still some old TKOs that come in this packaging looks just like this and everything but that's just kind of my tell if I can unscrew it then it makes me believe that for lack of better words someone else just filled it up someone just bought it and filled it up but if I can't open it just like with my smart cards it makes me feel a little more ease at mind you know anyway I don't want to take up too much more time I mean if you love to have a wave is them who are you sport videos for you to check out but yeah let me know down in the comment system below how skittles have made you feel what you taste it and what would you rate it and what else you think I should pick up from TKO and with that don't forget to share this video with at least one person that vapes oh my shirt yeah I know you've been seeing it here and there peeking and everything I'm of course wearing my high quality t-shirt hi AF

be doing a review on a select co2 oil cartridge the strain is cinex which i believe is a cross between cindy 99 and pineapple express so um i grabbed this one because this one looks really really nice you've seen it you can check my other videos if not but um check out the other co2 oil carts from them and they look like some standard co2 oil like fairly dark oil this one looks incredible same price same like batch as all the other co2 oils but it looked great so let me turn the camera around and show you then i'll take a couple puffs [Music] hmm [Applause] [Music] hey [Music] wow [Music] alrighty so let's get into this um first off i'll correct myself by saying it is actually a cross between cindy 99 or cinderella 99 and vortex i had not heard of vortex prior to this but seems like a good strain um very interested after just reading a quick leafly article about this strain seems like it's heavy on um less on the mirror scene in the cardiophiline which i get bored of seems like it's heavy on pinene and limonene potentially which i really like so first off trying to make more videos but struggling to find the time and motivation and also more so just not get greedy because i recently just bought like a gram of six star hash rosin that i was wanting to make a video on but i just got into it way too quick and didn't even take a picture prior to me opening it so i feel like that's not the best way to make a video so i'll buy another gram eventually and get a video on it and it was super great um but first let's start with what we have here cine cynix um so let's see it first off amazing for their co2 oil you normally don't get anything besides like that dark black oil basically which i'm not against for the price that it goes at it's pretty good stuff wow that's one of the best cards i've had in a good while um definitely has like a little base layer i always notice a heavier notes first a little bit of like that peppery taste but it is strong with the definitely taste a good bit of pinene in there and then maybe some like lemonade as well lemony is always light to me so if there's a lot i couldn't tell anyways that really really evens it out it's not it's always like such a standard boilerplate co2 oil taste which is a lot like whiskey or like there's usually a lot of humiliating in there this one it's got i mean it's got the slightest bit of that taste to it but it has so many other like terpenes going on that it overpowers that easily and that it's good it's uh it's very citrusy but it's like a heavy citrus it reminds me of grape with but it doesn't it's not like grape flavor it just reminds me of grapes grapes like a heavy fruity taste to me it's like um orange and mango is kind of mixed with like a peppery peppery main taste yeah so that's all i got on this one really but i mean that is a solid cart right there for their select co2 line highly highly um hats off to them because that's really really well done so thanks for watching i'm going to try and get more videos out especially some new brands not just the same old stuff but unfortunately there's not many new brands to work with so yeah i'll see what i can do but thanks for watching and grab one of these check it through the window of the cart first but even the dark ones look are pretty decent in my opinion but i mean if you see one like this go for it alright thanks for watching you'll have a great", "of86bQ13mnQ": "hey youtube what is up alex here back again with another quick video you know what time it is hit up rise and grabbed a couple of things i made it a terrapin run i ended up grabbing two of the sour tangy dabs sugar one gram dabs i grabbed two of them sour tangy is it upside down no not two of them sour tangy 55 bucks a piece for the gram 86 thc each one same batch and i also grabbed which i'm doing the review on is this sour grapefruit by terrapin sativa cartridge coming in at 89 percent thc there's the back i'll let you get a look at that the stats right there it is a cross between grapefruit durbin and sour tangy it is a distillate cartridge you guys know i don't do the distillates too often but 40 bucks for the half gram and terrapin they do make good distillate they do make good dabs it's the best price 55 for a gram of dabs 40 for a half gram cartridge as you guys know most of them are 60 and pharmaceutical rx is 70 dollars for a half gram cartridge and yeah they're good they're live resin but distillate 40 a half gram that ain't too bad i buy them every now and then so this is the review sour grapefruit sativa let's get it open there's a little safety seal tape right here on the bottom i guess you just peel that off and like as so and push in on the sides here these little flaps push in and push down and there's the cartridge i knew it was out of place i heard it wiggling around in there it fell out of its little holder it was moving around and he was supposed to be right there it kind of moved around let's take a look at it you know terrapin they got their mouthpieces there little head space on it a little head space on the oil that's a half gram distillate sour grapefruit distillate cartridge let's get this little rubber piece off the bottom there's the mouthpiece yeah let's get a few rips got my pen ready get the kangertech ready and uh give it a few rips and let you guys know

with a new review and like I said guys usually carry thanks but i beginni it's a new [ __ ] in I got skittles rocket carts premium distilling it is ninety percent THC right now I've been seeing the Oliver 90 percent THC and this one is a hybrid a thousand milligrams California we'd love the California we label the laws and everything down here the little whatever agreements they had whatever down there and look at this court guys look at that the courts way different in the ding babes all the way filled seal at the top seal at the bottom no bubble guys no bubble these [ __ ] come all the way through they do have you do have to rip this it's actually to get to the cart and they used to have to pop this on ziplock seal right here and then you get to this bad boy see how this one is guys I'm not shave you up and I can be trying new things but I personally like trying new things thanks don't do the job but these guys ever since I got the Girl Scout cookies and the Blue Dream and God's gift it's things are banging look at those guys here's the seal I just ripped it look you have to actually rip it to even get to it like you can't even even if you had this day you still couldn't get to it through this beautiful gold oil guys no hot dog water no hot dog water no bubble it does have that seal at the bottom the seal at the top it doesn't have any see so no Kane or nothing labels at the bottom it's just blank if you see this as well it has no prefilled hole it's sealed it's just a little knob right there you see the top look at that what do you take this you loft you can see the little filter holes where the air filters through so you can get those hits amazing tanks guys they aren't plastic this is glass so if you do drop it be aware you might break it the tanks I've dropped them way too many times in it don't break see how this is probably my lose battery won't have no more technical difficulties let me prime at first this one definitely has a little bit more of a fruity flavor than the Girl Scout cookies that Blue Dream and the gods gift all those only three they tasted like the bud this one has a little bit of a fruity flavor see how their first rip is guys you sweating a little bit guys my bad whoo okay I ain't even no lie fruity flavor rocket carts I've tried three of these this is my fourth this one's freakin delicious if y'all see these I might want to try them these are the [ __ ] right now for me they're a little bit better than Dinks but I hope y'all get to see them and try them first so y'all can give me your opinion let me see the second hey guys oh okay all right some reason I'm not getting those big poles that I got in the first three but the high I'm feeling it it is a body high it won't make you sleepy guys but it will make you gay slumped sit down you're done guys these are the [ __ ] let's give it a third hit just cuz I haven't got those big drags oh that one did it guys I'm baked my eyes for really low as you give me cotton off already the high ten out of ten rocket carts give them a try the flavor guys if you're used to the tanks that are fruity and taste just like they say these aren't like that these taste like flour and they fit skittles this one does have a little bit of a fruity flavor but it's not much so for me personally skittles as in rocket karts nine out of ten if y'all try them give it a shot these are good they're to me they're a little bit better than things you can believe the percentage more they don't go any higher than 90 like I said guys if y'all have any recommendations just put it down

cartridges with vape and batteries this episode is brought to you by New York vape shop you can find all the devices that were using in the demonstration today at NY vape shop calm and get a free gift with the code rough 3 first we're going to take it look at the anatomy of a 5-10 cartridge first I want to talk about the tip and the tips are pretty much a up to you like however you decide which is your preference is they come in all types of metal they're come in ceramic and they come in wood so the tips are pretty much straightforward next we're going to talk about the tanks the tanks themselves are what holds the oil and they're usually half a milliliter to one milliliter and sometimes the really big ones like the two gram or 2.2 gram heavy hitter cartridges can be really long but referring to the tank is the actual part of the cartridge where the oil is inside of it the two part and then there's the oil inlet and sometimes they come in various whole sizes you can see the one at the top there has a little bit larger hole size than the cartridge there at the bottom and generally for the thicker THC oils you probably want more of a thicker hole then there's the airflow if you can see at the very very bottom this is a bottom airflow and you can see that the airflow hole is right there in the threads at the bottom of the device other devices sometimes have them at the top near the tip and so generally one is either a bottom airflow in most cases sometimes a top airflow and then there's also what they call a variable airflow and you say the case here the airflow is adjustable at the top there so that's the one one thing to consider as well as part of your cartridge and the last and perhaps the most crucial part that we're going to talk about there's here at the base and that is the atomizer and the atomizers are usually either wick or ceramic and the wick they're okay but preferably you probably want to use ceramic today's you get a lot better even distribution better flavor and you see the ceramic heats the oil as it passes through now let's talk about best practices one of the most important things when it comes to using your 510 cartridges with a pin is to use the right voltage setting and you can see generally if it's a variable voltage for these kinds of pins that will vary somewhere between three and five volts and that's the appropriate range for most 510 cartridges but if you're using something like a box mod like the steam cloud that you see here that goes up to sixty watts it's going to be way too much so you're going to want to bring that down to like five watts or to the lower settings and to make sure that you're using the proper voltage or wattage another thing that you want to make sure is that using the proper airflow type you can see this is a bottom airflow device but used on this box mod if you pull it all the way in there there's no air inlet and so for this is the type that you'll need a top airflow so there are types of devices that may not be compatible with certain types of cartridges so that is one thing you want to make sure that for instance of this case you'd want to use a top airflow device and a variable and would be even better and you can see here - this is a bottom airflow and on the bottom airflow there will be a little bitty notch where the air would be allowed to flow through at the bottom of the device so you just want to make sure that you're using the right kind with the right type of device another thing is that when it comes to your empty device you probably just want to throw it and not throw it away but you want to refill it and not just keep hitting it because you're going to burn it out so when you get done with it either go ahead and toss it it's done or stop hitting it until you're ready to refill it or you're going to burn it out another thing is when you're putting in your pocket you really want to be careful with the tips especially with the ones that have an exposed tip and rather than sitting down into a sleeve because if you leave it in your pocket you can do something like this a lot of times it'll bend the tip over one way or the other can expose the electronics and cause you some problems so if you're going to be putting it in your pocket you might want to go with a device such as this where the cartridge sits down inside of it like a sleeve and the last tip we're going to go with here is to make sure that you keep your battery charged or keep a backup battery so if you have a nice pin that you like to use you might want to keep a little cheap on the side that you can have always kind of have as a backup by your charge in the other and that pretty much brings me to the end of my tips and best practices on

relaxed but i was still productive i run errands i met some food flavors really really gassy you feel me like that decently with that that earthy after like piney skunky aftertaste um the only bad thing i have to say when you burn it like i'm burning like a 3.4 3.5 i don't get the kick that i want but anything other than that it will uh burn your throat other than that i would recommend it and i will buy it again i give it a point four seven point five out of ten through leaf cam though turn up have a good one guys this is g for that connection", "Zo5jiigf_JM": "So I've come to public-housing\nneighborhood in London, and I'm about to meet\na guy named Hidrow. He's an underground\nweed-concentrates maker who treated his own cancer\nwith medical marijuana, and now supplies\nJohn's neediest clients with serious,\nhigh-potency cannabis oil. \u266a\u266a Always have one of these. Andavolu: Okay, good.\n[ Chuckles ] So, Hidrow,\ncan you take me through the cannabis medicines\nthat you make, and, like,\nhow you make them? Yeah, I'll give you\na first run out, and this is trim and leaf and a little bit\nof bud and stuff. Where do you get this trim from?\nWho gives it to you? Everybody's got a friend\nwho grows a little something, and, you know,\nthey throw it away, so I say \"Bring it to me. That, what you're throwing away,\nto me, is a lifesaver, and to other people can be\na lifesaver, you know?\" And when you say \"they,\"\nyou mean, like, people who are basically\nselling weed illegally. Yeah. Some of them are\nreally nice people. Some of them are\nvery horrible people. Some of them are --\nI would like to see them out of the business\ncompletely, because -- What do you mean,\nthey're \"horrible people\"? Well, they're not nice. They're criminals.\n[ Laughs ] You know,\nthey actually are criminals. [ Twisting cap ] After this,\nwe would take this and we literally have the most\ndangerous part of the process, which is where we have\nto actually decarboxinate it. You're putting a flammable\nsubstance next to heat source. Yeah -- never smart. You know, I --\nI mean, like, honestly -- Like, I'm pretty nervous\ndoing this inside. Um, stick your mask on,\nplease. -Because...\n-Um... What -- What can go wrong\nif this goes -- Um, you could burn down\na whole building. You could kill yourself.\nIt's extremely dangerous. All right, I'm actually\nvery nervous about this. [ Laughs ] \u266a\u266a I'll just take off my mask. Yeah, that's done.\nThat's just, uh, oil. Ooh, you can really\nsmell it, though. We don't charge. It's not about charging,\nyou know? How much\ndo you give away? Every week, about 20,000. 20,000 pounds? -Yeah.\n-Wow. But for someone, that could be, like,\n5 to 10 days of relief. And this is why we're -- we're\nactually fighting our government for the right\nfor medical access, because it shouldn't be\npeople like me, sitting in a dank,\nlittle house, risking my life\nand my -- my freedom. to produce\nhigh-potency cannabis oil, I wanted to know who was using\nthis back-alley medicine. So I'm joining John\nas he consults with a new patient,\nPaul Webster Hughes -- a single father of two\nand stroke survivor. Hello.\nGood evening, John. I'm Paul.\nIt's a pleasure to meet you. Hello, Paul.\nVery nice to meet you. Can you step aboard?\nI'm -- I'm good. Thank you. \u266a\u266a I've just given cannabis\nin the privacy of my own home. Thank you very much. And, uh,\nthat's a 1:1 strain, which is 15% CBD\nand 15% THC. There's no\nrecommended dosage, because there isn't\nany medical data on how we're to do this.\nOkay. But, really,\nwhat I'd say of anyone is try a very, very, very\nsmall amount. Just take -- even just, like,\na pinhead to start with until you just\nget used to it. No need to worry about money,\n'cause that's what we do. We give out\nfree cannabis oil.\nWell, thank you very much. Because Paul lacks\nregular, safe access to medical marijuana, he uses a combination of medical oil and street weed to treat the symptoms\nof his stroke at his home in North Yorkshire. [ Birds chirping ] Andavolu: So, Paul, if you could\nsort of take me through -- What happened to you? 2005 --\nI'm living in Thailand, and I went out\nto my wife's village. Went swimming\nin the morning, and later that morning,\nI just fell, and I've got videos --\nbizarre, coincidental. Paul: Now, while you're\nplaying around on there... [ Woman gasps ] -It's okay.\n-There's no blood. [ Child crying ]\nOkay... And I was paralyzed\non the left side of my body. [ Slurring ]\nDo you need any... [ Woman speaking indistinctly,\nchild crying ] Woman: Hey. [ Crying continues ] Paul:\nAnd for the next six months,\nI was carried to the toilet. I had about 10% of my left body,\nat that point. I've had a headache\nfor 11 years.\nWow. Can you imagine having\na headache for 4,100 days? -Straight?\n-Straight -- absolutely. I never get a break. Imagine big, rolling\nboulders or marbles crashing\noff each other. It's like a tightening\nof a skull cap on my head. Did doctors sort of\nprescribe you anything to sort of help?\nOh, sure. Yeah, I-I've been on\npretty much all the medications that they're allowed\nto give me. I was on 14 pills a day\nat one point. So, on these pills, physically,\nit closed me down, and a couple of them depress you\nenough to kill you. This last Christmas,\nI decided no -- no more. And, uh, that's when\nI started, uh, smoking, because it dulled\nthe pain. \u266a\u266a It allows me to do the things\nthat I must do. It gives me potential. The pain's still there,\nbut it's in a bubble. But it's like\nthere's an extra layer between me and my pain. My kids\ndon't see me smoke. I only smoke\nin my room. I don't smoke anywhere else\nin the house. I'm a single dad.\nMy kids come first. Hello, you. -What'd you doin'?\n-Hi. There's word\nfor your brother you'll learn\nwhen you're older -- seven girlfriends,\nI mean... He's a player! Okay, that's one way\nof putting it. Yeah, sure. All right,\nhere's the view -- pizza. Can you bang it on?\nYou can do that, can't you, huh?\nMm-hmm. All right, homework --\nWhat about French?\nI got my history. What was your history like? 64%. 64%. -Yeah.\n-Well done, you. -Pizza's ready!\n-Okay. Thank you, sir. Please.\nYou're very welcome. Oh, thank you very much. Meat Feast or pepperoni? I think it's Meat Feast,\none of your favorites. -Meat Feast.\n-Looks like it's Meat Feast. Do you guys sort of,\nlike, realize that, like, the marijuana\nthat your dad's smoking is still, like,\ntechnically illegal? Yeah, we do. How does that make you feel?\nLike, what... Uh... Kind of scared that\nhe's gonna get caught. Paul: If I thought there\nwould be a situation where our life\nwould be threatened, I wouldn't smoke.\nMm-hmm. That's just\nblack and white. They're more important to me\nthan, uh -- than anything. [ Speaks indistinctly ] Ooh.\nHey, you okay? Yes, yes. Is it sort of scary\nto think that he has to do something that's illegal to,\nlike, feel better? If it's helping him,\nI allow it. But if he's doing it\nfor no reason, really, I would feel\nkind of upset. Right. But it doesn't seem like\nhe's doing it for no reason. It seems like\nit helps him a lot, right?\nMm-hmm. Well, she hates smoking --\nI think that's the main thing. And she's got a pretty good\nsense of values. And to her, whatever\nshe sees in the world, says pot's bad. And she thinks\nin black and white. And now we give her\nthis conundrum that daddy needs it. It kind of throws a bit\nof a wobbly at her, you know? Mm-hmm. So she's trying very hard\nto reconcile that. We had a bit of a cry together\nand a cuddle upstairs, and, uh, she'll be okay. I mean, it's hard, right?\nAnd it's -- It's lousy. I have to live a lie,\nand no parent, especially when you've got\nabsolute love for your kids, wants to do that. \u266a\u266a I've come\nto Limehouse Marina in London to see John on the final leg\nof his journey. Today he's gonna take\nhis tiny, little canal boat into the mighty River Thames\nto let his cannabis banner fly and to drum up support\nfor marijuana reform right in front of Parliament. What we've got here are\nsome CBD-rich cannabis seeds. They're very low in THCs. I'm gonna pop them\nin the balloon. Okay. [ Helium hissing ] We are gonna tie some notes\nto them from patients -- medicinal-cannabis patients\nacross the UK, and we're gonna send those\nup into the sky and hope they reach\ncommunities across Albion. Amazing. [ Hissing continues ] So, what do you reckon the day's\ngonna be like for you? Uh, I am...\nI mean,\nyou're taking a small boat into big old body of water. It's gonna be a big old\nbody of water out there, be nice and choppy. How is it different from the small canals\nthat you go in? Uh, it's tidal,\nso it's pretty dangerous. Do you think the boat's\ngonna handle it? The boat is gonna handle it,\nmy friend. We do not like pessimism...\nOkay. Right on. ...anywhere near my boat.\n[ Laughs ] \u266a\u266a [ Boat motor humming ] All right, John!\nSee you, man! Goodbye, Krishna.\nGood luck. Namaste. Whoo-whoo!\nWhoo-whoo! [ Laughs ] That's the little barge\nthat could. \u266a\u266a [ Crowd cheering ] It's to legalize\ncannabis in London. [ Cheering continues ] -Hey, how's it going?\n-Nice to meet you, man. Good to meet you.\nHey, man. I'm Krishna. You guys excited? \u266a\u266a [ Siren wailing ] Hey, Paul. -Krishna, how are you?\n-How's it going, man? Aw, it's good to see you. -What a great event.\n-I know. How are you feeling --\nYou excited? I'm very enthused\nand excited about it. It's not just talk. These are real people\ncoming out and demonstrating\nthe reality they believe in. And that's got to make a\ndifference, Krishna, in the end. And what's it like being sort of\nbeing amongst this group of, like,\nother like-minded people? -Brothers. Family.\n-You think so? -Yeah.\n-Amazing. They're just be so open\nand honest about it. I asked them, did they feel\nat all self-conscious? Hell no.\n[ Laughs ] You know, this is what\nthey believe and what they do. Yeah, people are just, like,\nsmoking weed next to the Thames, next to Parliament. The English are\nvery law-abiding. But I think now that we're starting to see\na movement that's gonna\ngive us a change. And this is the mother\nof Parliaments. If it can't start here... -This is where it starts.\n-This is where it starts. \u266a\u266a Andavolu:\nAll right, it looks like he's just about to go\nunder Westminster Bridge, and he's just gonna pop out right in front of the Houses\nof Parliament and Big Ben. I saw him for just this little\nbit right on the other side, and he looked really tiny. Like, the boat was small. And -- Oh, look! You can\njust see him right there. He's coming in. \u266a\u266a [ Cheers and applause ] He's releasing the balloons. [ Laughs ] Amazing. Man: Go on, John!\nKeep going! Get those seeds!\nYou tell Cameron! [ Cheering continues ] Hey, John!\nHey, John! He gave the wave!\n[ Laughs ] He waved at us. And he looks so small\ncompared to that building. \u266a\u266a [ Cheers and applause ] \u266a\u266a As an American,\ncoming to the UK and seeing how medical-marijuana\npatients are faring -- In one way, it's a little\ndispiriting to see that they have to improvise and sort of do\nthis underground stuff to get what they think is\nmedicine that's gonna help them. But another way -- I'm seeing\nsomething sort of special. The people I met here\nare kind of filling in the gaps. Guys like John,\nlike Paul, like Hidrow, who are making real sacrifices\nin order to help people -- Robin Hoods of sorts -- they're forming these kind of\nad hoc underground communities, taking weed\nfrom the black market, making it into oil\nand medicine, and then giving it\nto the needy. That's kind of\na beautiful thing. That sort of, like,\nmodel of compassion is something I think\nthat the world can learn from. What I've seen in the U.S. is that legal weed\ncan equal money. But here in the UK, it seems like illegal weed\nequals compassion. And what's cool\nis that compassion is free. \u266a\u266a", "WwCPV68P4a0": "[Music] [Music] what's up guys simplicity here back with another video if you can tell from the title it is another wax video some diamonds today actually and what a coincidence you guys have been mentioning about west coast companies and stuff and i mentioned you know there's like a west coast company coming out every month um this one is west coast skier and this is actually a company i've tried before their cartridge so uh this has been around this guy these guys have been around and uh this was 27 out the door i will be playing a video of it right now but as with diamonds it's running with a high percentage of thc uh total cannabinoid is 95.4 percent um thc 82.5 and the strain is papaya cake and papaya to me is very familiar in tasting with guava so uh that's what i i'm assuming i think i think i've had a papaya before and i'll just like guava so uh but yes i already opened it it looks good smells good 27 out the door and it goes to say with all their stuff west coast gear had their diamonds live resin butter or whatever they were all the same price i believe at authentic and the smell is there you know i'm saying which is surprising because with diamonds there's not really too much smell or taste um so i'm i'm hoping that these taste as good as they smell but it's definitely gonna get me smacked up we got the dip no i'm saying oh i just turned it off but let's just turn that on leave this cap over here and get a big diamond for the people [ __ ] people are always saying like i take small dabs i'm like well it's not a competition i take enough for me to get high you know i'm saying it's not a race it's not a competition you know since when was smoking weed and relaxing a competition you know i'm saying like it's really crazy what like people trip over especially on a video on youtube someone you don't even know you know i'm saying like so what if i'm taking small dabs it's like that's so that's so weird you know the bigger dabs you take the higher tolerance you have you know and in turn just that's a lot of money cheers uh there's no taste i don't think yeah there's no days so i would suggest you get like a very flavorful wax like raw garden or something and then mix a little bit of that sauce with this kind of like what i was doing with the delta eight you know put more of the delta eight and then some of the wax that you've been trying to save and uh it'll basically just take over the wax taste will take over the distillate or in this case the diamonds so uh you can actually get like fat hits and actually make use of shittier lower like not lower quality but like lower potency wax you know mix it with this i can definitely see me using that like that but as far as like taste goes maybe maybe i just got it wrong [Music] so i'm gonna pack that one more time for this video but as far as the taste goes there is none it smells good though or maybe a that's the thing with diamonds guys i don't know if you guys know but like if you're gonna get diamonds try to get like the saucy diamonds you know with like 50 50 sauce and 50 diamonds but cheers guys might i say i am [ __ ] stoned i'll tell you that right now the other video i did of the cali blaze was like an hour ago i'm continuing the ride i wonder if since this doesn't smell or tastes like any air doesn't taste like anything if it smells right all right guys so for its price 27 it's not bad i probably should have purchased um alongside another one of their their cartridge uh they're i'm pretty [ __ ] stoned guys i purchased another one of their wax concentrates like maybe the live resin instead of the diet or not uh purchase the live resin and the diamonds and just mix them when i take hits that would have been dope but yeah as far as like if it gets you high it definitely does but i knew this coming in buying diamonds most likely not going to be like any taste if so minimal um so i i knew what i was going into just kind of sucks that the kelly blaze kind of tastes like all right so if i were to be mixing any wax it'd be those two and it's like damn i could have had another west coast cure or a raw garden you know but other than that hopefully you did enjoy this wax video check out west coast cure if you're looking for some affordable diamonds with no taste but it doesn't matter if it doesn't have no taste you can just mix it with some other stuff but i can see some people saying that you know like what the [ __ ] no taste [ __ ] that [ __ ] but it is cheap diamonds are usually i would say 35 and up so um for at 27 is a eye catcher to say the least you know but other than that hopefully you didn't enjoy this video i would do like i would do i i would like to mention that i'm pretty [ __ ] stoned right now so i haven't started like this in in a while in a video so that definitely means something but other than that hopefully you did enjoy the video peace out [Music] you", "A3ZFodq2bIY": "if you guys clicked on this video makes you guys you're 18 and up or a cannabis patient these videos are made for an educational purpose in the cut welcome back everybody to a brand new video today I got yet again another select wax cartridge I got you guys man you guys been doing these like wax cartridges I went for the hybrid I went for the cherry pie and so a little bit about this it's a hybrid I believe it's more than a sativa science I'm pretty sure because sometimes when it's yellow it's kind of like a sativa hybrid you know so it is cherry pie and I've tried this only like once or twice just because I throw this and I I bought this and all we're having at me and some of the guys were having a sesh so we just kind of threw this some rode oh and man like this man I only have it just a little bit enough just to kind of show you guys look at that all right right there so like always everybody we got to select you guys see that right there we like it that I just like that 83% zero six eighty three point zero six percent THC and it's some cherry pie you guys know was good I'm completely sober right now so we're gonna see how many hits it takes for us to get lit so cherry pie everybody again welcome to another podcast I hope you guys are enjoying these also everybody makes you guys drop a like the comment subscribe 18 another educational purposes like always everybody make sure you guys once again actually let's take let's take the first shrimp so on there's if we got a brand new pen this pen is actually a little bit different the red is actually the lowest setting the blue is like the medium and the green is like the highest so I'm just like wait what cheers everybody see if I could get like a taste okay so it does kind of become like a bit like a little cherry like a little cherry aftertaste like a little punch like a little cherry punch hmm see the cool thing that I like about select cartridges and regarding cartridges is they don't really be adding a lot of flavor sometimes when they be adding flavor that shit's kind of like a bad chemical you know I mean I'm pretty sure it's a pretty bad chemical you know if they were to add some flavor on it might be not too harmful but I mean if you guys are damn [ __ ] you guys are heinous [ __ ] all day you know it's just definitely bad for you but these happens man these are coming these be coming and going like crazy so look at that we got the little select logo um I think there is a couple pink ones bro like that strip tap fake select I feel like nowadays man they could probably make anything bro literally anything for example like again you guys know this I already tried on fake brass not though I seen fake King pens I've seen what other fake it's mainly brass knuckle I've seen a couple fake heavy hitters and it's just like damn people are thinking like man I'm getting the jug but in reality you guys are just can that custom that home that custom made oil could be a little bit cheap who knows some plugs can potentially make some good fire stuff so who knows but let's take another first hit select does not disappoint I mean out of all of them out of all of them I feel like select is top 3 I gotta admit top 3 when it comes to like actually getting lit again select does have like a little meaning like a point 3 cartridge which is like an ax it's in high 90 percent THC and oh my god roll you take a rip of that 1 or 2 a deer man but it's not around like 40 50 bucks just for that little piece of like super concentrated THC it's crazy but a cheers OH I think now I feel like I can probably tell the difference from a lot of wax cartridges like this definitely has select I'll written all over like all of them have like different tastes if it's crazy the raw garden one you can tell right away like bro if I were to close my and I woulda hit a wrong garden and if I were to know if I were to hit a rock garden I'd be able to tell it's like you know chewing out a piece of leaf you know piece of tree piece of bush and that's the leg type I got that it's so weird I'm not I'm horrible at explaining especially explaining a taste but it has like this let me see if let me see if I can explain to you guys definitely I think select cartridge is a lot better than a Moxie but the Moxie does have a really great flavor but again you know that's what a lot of people say you know when it has a good it has like a good candy type flavor and yeah it's definitely not good for you you know because they'd be adding stuff for the flavors because in reality it's like okay if they were to press a certain tree huh you know what there's just so much to it man I there's so much learning to this to this industry you know like I just I just keep thinking about it like it doesn't make sense because sometimes when you don't taste something I'm just like okay cool it's legitly the concentration you know it's literally the oil from the flower you know it's nothing else added to it which makes it just taste like like literally just one single taste which is kind of dough same with raw garden that's what I figured you know Rob garden it always has like the same flavor that same strong flavor with like maybe a little hint of something and you can tell but it depends on the flower like the natural flower you know but sometimes we have like for example I'm not saying heavy hitters brass knuckles and all that stuff sucks or anything like that I'm still gonna cop some here and there but I'm saying like the flavor is too artificial like it's not artificial but it definitely for me I feel like they could potentially add some something to it just so I could get that flavor you know but I could be wrong you know I could be wrong that's just my thought but again everybody I'm not saying to not buy those brands you know because in reality they are you know proved as long as you guys are like like legitly getting them from like the club or the you know the dispensary and stuff you guys aren't really getting them from your local drug dealer cuz your local drug dealer listen to this you guys I talk about this in all pretty much all my wax cartridge videos because sometimes you know these guys they could probably make the wax you know the oil pretty good and you know what hey you got yourself a good cartridge homemade wax you know but at least it's like nothing crazy you know but then there's also other cartridges you know for example like in my experience what I had is like you know I poked out in a couple times and they just turned brown and I'm just like yo this does not look normal yeah it was like a thirty dollar brass knuckle you know like it was definitely fake it was not it was not the real brass knuckles of faith it was a fake brass knuckle but that's one way you guys could see and sometimes let's chop the other sensitivities 1 2 3 I think it's just good 3 oh wait a minute green as the middle one look at that that green is definitely the better wood yeah green is definitely the middle one tastes a lot more made-up fatter cloud and I do see a couple people sometimes like there was this um I had a friend that they came to visit me during my lunch yeah my old job right and they were like eh like you smug and I was just like well I mean sometimes you know not all crazy she's like they're like oh I got a I got a wax pen right I'm not gonna call them out or anything but like yeah I got a wax Maran I was like yeah that's good so they took it out right and I looked at it don't like have a halfway smoke and I was like what is this it was like some off-brand you know wax cartridge right and I was like I like bro you're selling your smug on some fake ass [ __ ] didn't it was just like so black the oil will you see this right here the oil it's like halfway through maybe like they smoked it like right here no no maybe like right there like literally get halfway and I guess what they said was that it just started turning black and I was like dude you know that's like when that's when it's fake and I was like what kind of car is it was like some designer brand not a designer brand I come it was some type of brand where I'm just like - right off the bed I'm just like yeah man you got to turn me little your local drug dealer huh you know my head I'm like why you know 1 2 3 all right let's try it off in the in the max um setting well I have your cloud the taste it's not too gay Don the highest win oh not too good this pen is to spit it's $50 pen don't get me wrong it's a nice pen but definitely not for Lake we tried a couple well we tried a couple um we tried a couple of these select cartridges already I liked select so it was literally like the first one to go to like this is the one that I wouldn't always like gay you know it's really good brand you know but right now the brand that I've kind of uh have been buying lately there's a lot of regarding rocker and is really nice rock garden is a good one but don't get me wrong rock garden and select are way different and they're both good so you know you could either go this router this round or you know cop one of each but definitely switch off you know mine I'm definitely gonna cop another Moxie cart I really like the flavor I mean it's some light resident in a wax cartridge you know and it's it's only $25 1/2 gram this one was about $35 1/2 gram I believe or 25 no no no I think this was 20 bucks I think $20 a minute there look at the thing dude half gram was like 25 I believe 25 um so it's not that bad whatsoever you know I like it it's a hybrid it doesn't have me all slump or like super awake I mean I like that super awake feeling you know the sativa that way I could be very productive but right now it's almost gonna be 9 p.m. so might as well you know just hit some in because and stuff like they're you know such it's pretty good oh one thing that a lot of people do not know and then my dumb ass just remembered especially here right here let's check this out so the directions or suggested serving a suggested serving which is one serving is three seconds so this is one serving I think I went a little overboard at three four seconds but three to four seconds is one serving and there is a hundred and twenty five servings so it's so let's see so let's start off it says right here look one three second draw and close cartridge contains 125 servings so what one three second draw is a so three times 125 so if we were to drag this it would take 375 seconds and if we were to do that and be around six or seven minutes so wait a minute so six or seven minutes of you pump that makes sense because if you're just gonna go sir like four minutes you'll smoke the whole thing hmm six eight minutes of hitting and that's why I love having baby hits - oh okay now that - that was just like a little fact that I just like read from the back a lot of people don't really know but yeah usually it's like a three to four second scene and I'm different once I'm pretty sure it's for all of them it's for the 510 thread the the pens or whatever but um um so three to four three to four seconds is one hit yeah but you have around 125 settings so if you were to take at least one serving a day that's literally a 125 1/2 gram of this but that means you have to be like super lightweight you never had any type of th in your blood whatsoever you know oh and another thing too that I'm just spacing out at this point what at this point pretty much what you want to do is I guess one of my boys put me on actually shot up oil yeah shout out chicken but pretty much when you hate when you have a pen you want to hit it right you hit it and then you have to wait I think maybe like 30 second I believe I freaking forgot but he said 30 seconds or more you have to you want to wait like 30 seconds in between that way it kind of cools down you know because if it's too hot the coils it might not burn right you know you might not get the best like the full potential of the hit you know so you want to make sure that you wait at least 30 seconds let it kind of cool down is that way so you can get like the best you know now I'm gonna try to tell everybody that because he told me that I'm just like dude I see people just rip this [ __ ] blow it out rip this [ __ ] blow it out rip this [ __ ] blow it out past I see a little person rip it blow it out and I'm just like damn maybe that's all the wax is being over burnt and it's not even like I mean at the same time it's it's gonna get burned you know it's gonna file but if you want to have like a perfect hit that's when you have to wait at least like over 30 seconds that's what he told me you know and in my head I'm just like yeah it makes kind of sense but let me know in the comments down below what do you guys think crazy stuff man but I just said bad but man but if you say man isn't but right out it just sounds like Pampa that's crazy so there we have it everybody we have some elite select cherry pie hybrid wax cartridge I hope you guys enjoyed this video make sure you guys drop a like a comment subscribe again this is the podcast thank you guys for tuning in like always let me know the comments down below if there's any cartridge or anything any strain or anything like that any flour anything you guys want me to review and drop them in the comments you know like always everybody catch you guys in the nice video let's take one more drag I was looking at some of the old videos that I um I've uploaded look at that sauce diamonds and 99 percent THC sugar crystals 710 labs Percy live rawson unquestionable at handy rare wax oh now we live Moxie car we're talking about

them oh look at that better mode you better off fire yeah fire", "6X3A9BVYnFo": "I was lucky all su boy master blue see back again with another video today I'm gonna be looking at this TKO skittles part I just want to make another video hopefully maybe the last video I need to make on fake TKOs um just because there's a little bit more information that I have now that I just like to give to you guys and because I finally have a box so I could show you guys really what a fake looks like when it comes the box is for wedding cake I didn't get a wedding cake current I just got this get one anyway let's get into the review so first off when we look at the TKO extracts cart we see that it has the fake symbol on it TKO extract symbol does not look like that I'm gonna do a walk-through of their website in this video so that you guys can see what strains they offer and what their pens actually look like but these are always fake and the tubes are not their real packaging they come in boxes also the fact that it's a full gram cart makes it a fake because TKO currently only sells their carts as half grams and they only sell them in two states I'll go over that more when I'm going through the walkthrough of your website but either way let's look at this wax quality as you can see whoever I bought it from and I have been hitting this cart just a little bit I think I've hit it like three times just to make sure I wanted to review it and yeah the wax is nice and slow and I will say right now that it's also very smooth on the front of it we see TKO and then it has that very fat chimney which is also another side of it being a fake I ended up weighing this cart when I first got it against this one which is one of the old atomizers from those last TKOs I got and it ended up being only 0.8 grams of wax in this cart versus a full gram so if you are buying these TKOs with the phat chimney you are getting ripped off so if you guys would like me to show you how I scaled these carts I can show you guys in an they're video just so you can do your own checks at home either way for now I'm going to be going into the first rips so you guys can see the cloud production on this cart and I can show you guys how smooth it is so let's get into that alright so I have the cart loaded onto my Cecil m3 battery and I'm just gonna go ahead and take my first rips so Cheers this cart is so smooth honestly it rips very nicely and it tastes amazing um the cart being skittles which is a mix of grapefruit and grade 8 it tastes just like if you would take the flavors out of orange juice and grape juice and then mix them into a cart um very very nice it's a pleasure to hit this card I find myself wanting to hit it more than I should simply because of how smooth and good it feels so cheers again [Music] all right so that blinker made me coffee around five times but honestly that's not that bad considering it is a blinker and I haven't really been hitting carts too much today um the TKOs or at least these batch that I've been getting have been very smooth and very nice they hit very hard as well after three to four hits I get pretty high this being my probably third hit now I don't know if I got all three on camera but it being my third hit now I'm getting lens flares with all the lights around me I'm feeling very very light um and very talkative and sort of relaxed as well I really really love the strain Skittles has been my second favorite strain for a long time I really like these TKO cards but unfortunately I cannot suggest them um now I'm gonna actually go into my computer and just show you guys some stuff about fake TKOs that I think is important for everyone to know um and is the biggest reason why I'm not gonna be suggesting them before I go into my computer and show you guys the TKO website and talk to you guys a bit more about why fake TKOs are dangerous um basically what's going on is some people actually being admitted into hospitals now because of breathing problems related to smoking fake cards and unfortunately TKO has been sort of one of the bigger companies that's been sort of under fire because of it and it's really not even their fault because they're taking the steps to produce high quality wax and all of these fake companies are just using their name and sort of soiling it which is really unfortunate um so that's why I can't really suggest these cards simply because I don't want to lead you guys into getting hurt um because well I did get a good TKO card I don't know if you will and if yours looks like mine and you hit it at least once and it feels really smooth and flavorful then it's probably a safe card to smoke but you probably shouldn't also take that chance if you know what I mean so let me go into my computer I'll show you guys TKO is website I'll show you guys the four strains that they actually do offer let's go ahead and do that and then I'll do a wrap-up so see you guys there all right hey guys what's up so I'm just gonna walk you through TKO products website it's not TKO extracts its products and then their division is called TKO extracts and as you can see here they only have four strains which are pineapple express rich gelato Northern Lights and rose gold um they also only sell them as a half gram cartridge that's fully disposable um they do not sell them in full grams and they don't sell them in tubes it will always look like this if they are legit now um and I also wanted to show you something else that's really cool so I'm in my email right now I'm a kind of bit out so you guys don't see some of my more personal information but basically I reached out to TKO extracts and I said hello I'm a small youtuber who makes videos exposing fake cart brands I've done two videos on fakes of your products which I can send you links to I'm just reaching out to find out if you can give me a list of things to look for when spotting fakes over real products from your company any reply would be greatly appreciated thank you so much master blinky and TKO actually did respond to me so I'm gonna read you that email right now says thanks for reaching out I've seen your videos and appreciate your work at exposing the fakes you are on point about what to look for including how to check if carts are cut or not we are getting reports of people getting sick from carts including a person in the ICU for lung issues what do we don't know is if the issues are related to smoking carts or other issues that were made worse from smoking anything all we know is that after years on the black market were no standards had to be followed I do feel bad about what I put in my own body being pesticide free especially after talking with people from the lab and hear about the crap they find and some of the tests they run best but for people is to only buy from licensed shops and states that require testing you pay more but quality does cost money I would also suggest looking for high potency test results RT ke o of HR testing around 85% THC we use distillate that tests in the 90 % rage 90 to 95% and after we add terpenes for flavor it reduces the potency to 85% anything advertised over 90% is [ __ ] unless this period Issel it with nothing at all at it it won't have any flavor to it as to do so will dilute the potency bill so that plus just showing you guys their vape products is a big reason why I can't suggest them to anyone simply because I don't want any of you guys to end up in the hospital because of what you guys are vaping so I'll go back to myself now um and do a wrap-up but basically I just wanted to show you guys that email and their website so you guys could get just a final like example on how to see if it's a fake or a real TKO extracts card so yeah alright hey guys what's up so it's been around 3 days now and I've still been smoking on the skittles cart I'm sorry I didn't come back sooner I've had a very busy past few days but uh I definitely just want to do this wrap up so after showing you guys all the stuff online and that email that is the biggest reason why I can't suggest these cards to people simply because I don't want any of you guys to get hurt but that being said this batch that I got or at least this part and the that last mango gelato part were both very amazing they were very smooth they hit very hard and gave the effects of the strains that they were supposed to and they tasted the same as the strings they were trying to emulate um this current is very nice if I could suggest it to you guys without having to worry about the health risks I would give this fake that I got an 8 out of 10 um flavor was good the high length was around two and a half hours so I'm not completely at three but it was very potent as well um and they hit super smooth just go ahead and take a blinker through this regular clip just to show you guys how to smooth they are so Cheers [Music] very nice I was able to hold that and I'm not coughing and I don't feel like I want to call I don't even have a dry throat right now so for this cart I thought anyway for this cart definite eight out of ten but I can't suggest it for two days of heavy use I probably have around point two grams left and I started out with 0.8 so I'm happy with my experience with this cart but if you all are trying to get some or if you guys see them around you and want to actually look into them just make sure you watch for the oil quality and if you hit it and it's dry and it hurts do not hit it anymore please either way this was this might be the last video I do want to fake TKOs I'm thinking it will be because I don't really have anything else to say about them but if you guys want I can still review ones that I get if I end up getting four so I'm master bling see thank you guys for watching if you aren't subscribed to the channel do that please I really want to try to hit 10,000 by my birthday which is in February so yeah I'm about to start really trying to get on that grind there's gonna be a few changes to the channel coming up I'm gonna try to film the channel update soon but either way I'm master bling see

through why I brought it I'm pretty much like this is gonna be a little story time because I wanted to make a video and while I'm out here so when I get back I could just upload and you guys could see something while I'm out here so yeah today guys we're gonna be ripping on the West Coast curd I'll take up close a close-up after this yeah very very nice man I'm like I'm a little bit more than half no a little bit less than halfway he's done with it but I've been trying to use this so scarcely but we're gonna take a quick rip before we get into the storytelling stuff like that oh so cheers boys if you guys are 18 and over 21 and over you guys know the deal [Music] man it's nice to being able to smoke outside dude my tolerance has gone down a significant amount surprisingly cuz since I haven't really really been able to smoke all day how like I usually do or at least every couple of hours like literally the past week that I've been here has only been like maybe two times double so if you guys are coming in from any legal state flying out you know it's an illegal state I'm gonna show you guys what I'm not gonna show you guys I'm gonna tell you guys what to do cuz I'm already over here there's no way I can do to him so the way I did it first first and foremost let me show you guys the way I did it so if you guys are have a girlfriend a wife girl that you're going with on a trip this will just make things a hundred times easier so what you can do is just obviously attach your cartridge to your stick and then just all you do is it'll just pop drop it in her makeup bag and then that's it dude you're good to go you could probably do up to two or three cartridges I don't recommend doing a lot of them and I don't recommend compact inch if you're gonna take we do not compact it because I learned a few tricks over here my uncle he works for the airlines and he knows a bunch of tricks up his sleeve and stuff like that he was telling me like what they live for so I mean let me just boss you guys up in a little game right now so we're usually in airports what they're looking for is in drugs that's not what they're looking for like you guys making like oh they're looking for toys and looking for my wood and my weed you know things like that but that's not the case even though it's not gonna be hard for them to know who has it like just don't don't overdo it don't be stupid don't just go in there thinking like oh they're not looking for drugs so I can go in there and go ahead and walk in with an ounce that's definitely not the case so all right they're looking for obviously explosives guns anything that can pretty much cause any damage or danger to anyone inside the airport like if you guys don't know lax is one of the biggest or not well this isn't only lax but I'm referring to LAX abuse out to the airport that I flew out of so yeah and LX are looking for explosive guns et Cie things like that so drugs is it's not one of their top priorities so as long as you're not overdoing it man there should be no issue to be honest like he was telling me as long as like one thing that you have to do if you're like I'm not advising this I'm not telling you guys go do this and go like try it out but if he has you know I have medical issues if he has I have anxiety like me personally I have so much anxiety dude like that day that I was flying out I had so much anxiety that I literally [ __ ] was crying bro like once I landed it was horrible I mean I'm not ashamed to say that I cried cause it's just anxiety man it's where humans everyone feels it specifically you know and cheers to them here I remember take up a trip for you guys so yeah like I was saying oh yeah this car is so amazing by the way by West Coast cure if you guys can see it hopefully you guys can very very amazing and yeah let me just get back to my story so one thing he told me if you're gonna bring weed um weed in general cartridges don't really matter because it's a liquid usually everything scans through liquids you can tell very very hard to detect and yeah so I'm not saying this isn't me saying like oh you can take as many cartridges you want I'm the same be smart and take one or two three hemos you know you don't really need to have more than that unless you're a fiend bro so now on to the weed if you don't like cartridges and you guys are more about weed them he said he went from what I know he told me that all you have to do is just you can carry in there just make sure it doesn't smell and make sure you just like wrap it up stash it you know but don't compress it too much because usually what comes up on the RFID readers it comes when they're passing it through the little readers what they're looking for is compact compressed items so basically because if you guys don't know that's usually how bombs are made you you compact what it is whatever the material is and then that's what makes a bomb you can't have a bomb with a little super piece of [ __ ] you know material it has to be very very mass amount compact until like it doesn't have to be a ball but you guys know when I'm referencing to so that's a little trick and then honestly you guys there's another one that I've done it at like shows and stuff like this I've never tried this at an airport I mean I don't recommend this type if you guys really are trying to get through when you can do is just hide the cartridge on the bottom of your plastic piece of your shoe and when you're passing through the metal detector just slide your foot like walk put left foot over whichever isn't carrying the cartridge and then on your right just slide slide it down you know just fairly you can barely lift it I think it's like an inch from what I've done before so yeah no more than an inch so you should be good after that and yeah I'm just sorry if I keep you looking away there's just so much scenery around me and it's just catching my attention so we're gonna take another hit and just keep talking keep ranting seeing what what this day is about man so yeah I brought this on here I left on Monday it's currently already Thursday it's Friday tomorrow man I go back on Sunday so which means I have two more days out here and this pen has been coming in clutch because like I said my anxiety dude my anxiety was kicking my ass since the morning I had a good on the plane like it's not that I'm scared to fly or anything I've flown before I've flown to Mexico I've flown to other places but just the anxiety of being away from home it's just something that I've had you know there on my whole life so wait to whatever this is this is something that has helped me a lot throughout my last couple years I'm dealing with anxiety and stuff like that so and I'm gonna show you guys this one I know I already made a video on this with a West Coast cure cartridge I'll go ahead and post that in the link in the description below if you guys want to check out that video but I've made a video on this um battery before and it's called the X tube so basically what it is it looks ugly right it looks ugly like this and okay whatever you're not supposed to have a beautiful battery but that's just a [ __ ] thing in your head for if you if you're one of those people that likes things that are aesthetically pleasing I don't blame you man I'm some sometimes I'm like that too so but this battery isn't for you so this value what it does this little detachable piece right here so as you guys can see I have a little a little oil bubble right there right little air bubble I mean so what this does I'll screw it on there click it twice and then what it does it'll start preheating right you'll see it oh it's already dead because I've been using all week so I can't use a preheat function but what it does it'll heat up the outside of the cartridge and then it'll make the oil warm enough for it to move up and so how good that is is because most a car batteries that pre-heat your [ __ ] they preheat from the coil within so basically what that is it's burning the oil that's why when you take hits you can still puff like with this if I were if it was charged and I were to do that you wouldn't know smoke would be coming out at all like sometimes the only downside is the tip does get hot sometimes because it does get heated up a lot so if you guys are looking for a cartridge that I mean for a battery that does it all now this is my favorite one for sure the only bad thing about it is I don't think you could fit like a tank of apes and [ __ ] like that it's more of that just the regular - really really slim cartridges so yeah man I'm gonna take another hit hopefully this battery still yeah so we're just gonna oh no it's still it's still going you just can't preheat it because the preheat function does I think that's what takes up most of the battery life because it preheats it for like a good 20 to 30 seconds because it wants to get all the oil out obviously man this West Coast cure is amazing yeah I'm gone man I'm just gonna go ahead and end this video here enjoy the rest of my time here I hope you guys are enjoying the rest of your week you guys are gonna see this on Monday so enjoy your week from now on you know and for all the new people here thank you for conforting me and for the people who have been here for a while thank you for the continuous support you guys are gonna be seeing some big things coming within the next couple of weeks so look forward to that and yeah if you guys enjoyed today's video go leave a like comment sub and we're out you can", "ZHJqEUTD11U": "hey how's it going i'm here to uh make a quick review for this vape cart right here called the willys reserve oro blanco distillate card as you can see here it's made by buckeye relief and it does have cannabis derived terpenes and cannabinoids and as you can see the uh thc percentage is actually a little bit above the uh 70 legal maximum here in ohio and the terpene content is quite high uh two i think 20.9 milligrams per gram is the same as two percent and i actually got a couple other carts out to show this was the highest mercedes content that i've seen on any cart so far and it was a buckeye relief aeropro live flower series so that should be really comparable to this because they both have distillate and cannabis derived terpenes and here's a little container you can see this one has 20.9 and mercene is the highest and on this one it actually has 40.75 so aeropros are just extremely high in terpenes and that's why they're probably my favorite but i really do like this reserve cart and i actually have a little bit of the willy's reserve flower here that i got a while ago it's not the same strain but this one's called cocoa and i really like it i have a couple little buds i've been saving and then also i just ordered a couple things uh from a uh a guy that i know from reddit and uh discord he actually makes these extensions and also this like this base thing right here it's pretty neat i haven't really tried it out yet um and see how i have it set up now is with my divine tribe atomizer here but i'm gonna take that off and just use use it with the cart just to show it but um here's my regular little card atomizer or battery oh and he also sent me this too which is a nifty little luster pod holder so that's pretty cool has a nice little ohio with the cannabis leaf on it on the bottom so it's really nice yeah so here's my regular seed battery pop this thing out of here i've been using it um i definitely i like it so far wr for lily's reserve has a little thing in the top there a little plug yeah i'll just go ahead and take a hit off this first it has really good flavor um just like i would expect from buckeye relief i've really enjoyed all of their products that i've tried so far [Music] they seem to have really good effects they uh you know they they seem to work um they have really good customer service i've emailed and contacted them a few times um oh another cool thing about this mod that i bought is it actually already has the uh different firmware on it so that's pretty cool so hopefully i'll be showing you guys more of this setup soon but anyway i have my dab cap here i don't know if you're familiar with those but it just lets you use a cart with uh like a water piece so i like this a lot let's take this off for a second let's see here just unscrewing the divine tribe atomizer base right now and attaching the cart it's not really meant to use a cart with this extension but but i figured this would work okay so here we go oops this would be easier just make sure it's not turned up too high that's pretty good all right just set that there just hold it like this now just go ahead and hit it works pretty well i'm a big fan of this this little guy this uh dab cap here that uh accidentally turned my phone off there so hopefully i'll get these two videos connected to each other but um yeah take another hit off this i forgot to push the button yeah i i'm a big fan of this so far um the willys reserved cart oro blanco which means white gold um i think that's that's about all i have to say um shout out to fear and lawyering who is the the guy who made this stuff this uh little carousel thing uh and base here and then also the extension um yeah that's all i have to say thank you bye", "OM5r3zFdvPg": "so real quick before I even start the video I figured the reason you clicked on it was to find out how to see if a Wankel oil card is fake so let's just go over that really quickly first up the Wonka oil label will be raised but every individual letter will be embossed into the packaging as you can see this is raised but every letter is like the same texture so that's not a good sign secondly up here it should say Wonka's Cecil not Wonka ceramic and thirdly there should be a sticker in every package that was your quick thirty second guide on how to tell a real Wonka oil cart now let's get into the video [Music] all right hey guys what's up it's you boy mr. bling seat back again with another video today I'm gonna be doing a little rapid-fire review of these Wonka oil carts I am 99% sure these are fakes but as I'm unboxing them I'm gonna actually like look at them very closely and confirm whether or not my suspicions are correct um so yeah let's get into it I'm gonna start by looking at this trainwreck Wonka oil cart the reason I think that these are fake are the boxart for starters it's a lot more faded than the actual box art you'll get from Wonka loyal carts 'as it has the same writing on the back as the normal packages from what I can find online but the thing is when you open a true Wonka oil cart and you pull it out there should be a stick I don't have a sticker they come with a little Wonka oil sticker so you can like put it places and I guess the fakes they didn't decide to like recreate the sticker that long ago oil gives the cart feels heavy the wax looks a nice color and let's see if it moves at all it looks like it's barely moving so that's a good sign for this being a fake cart but that being said even that TKO cart I looked at uh moves really slowly also there's a white ring on the inside of the cecil atomizer and a lot of you guys in the comments have been telling me that the white ring means that it's a fake sea salt atomizer so that also is discouraging considering the fact that like you know you're buying these carts you want to have good atomizers with them the wax is still barely moving but that just could be because they mix it with something hella thick so I won't be able to know the quality of the distillate until I actually get to vape on them so imma go ahead and open the other box for you guys just so you can see that one maybe that one's like a real cart um but yeah I'm open the other box and then we'll go ahead and take our first puffs okay so next up we're gonna be opening the savage easel Wonka this one looks like it's already been looking a little bit before that's discouraging I don't think whoo I got these from would take out the stickers but like they're still out there here's the card let's check the wax quality same as with the last card it moves barely at all like that I'm really happy with it and I'm really hoping that these end up being decent because like I'm tired of buying really crappy fake carts it's got the white ring which means that it's a fake see cell atomizer so just like the other current I'm pretty sure this one's a fake so let's go ahead and puff on them see if they taste good at lease or if they hit hard and then hold you take a day to review them like usual and I'll come back at y'all tomorrow all right so to cut down on time I already loaded my vapes with the carts this is the train wreck and this is the Sour Diesel oh these are DAB cap compatible so I'm going to be hitting them through the deaf cap as well as hitting them just through the vape so first off we're gonna go with the sour diesel off the seesaw silo just to hit it see how it tastes and see how it rips so cheers guys okay it's not hitting like immediately and I don't know if I've like screwed on my vape thing too tight so let's see if that was the case okay so no it wasn't the fact that I screwed on my date base too hard it's just not hitting this is gonna be really disappointing I'm unscrewing it and it smells like how these discipline cards usually smell like so I doubt that it's like fake fake fake fake like a bad fake so let's just try it one more time I'm not even getting a draw on it I don't understand what's going on okay I might be experiencing technical difficulties with my silo so I'm gonna see if it hits off the m3 so cheers on that hopefully oh that tastes really good that actually tastes amazing there wasn't that much draw resistance on it at all after hating it off of this battery um the taste was amazing and it felt really smooth if you notice I didn't even call and I'm pretty sure I got a good vapor cloud so I'm gonna hit it off the dab cap real quick just to show you like how it will rip through a piece so cheers on that [Music] [Music] it really does taste very good so like I'm a fan of that that's the train wreck so after trying nated the Sour Diesel off of the Cecil m3 I noticed that it didn't even work either I'll show you guys real quick it's not hitting so I'm gonna have to transfer the distillate from this car to another atomizer and hope it works then so I'm very happy I ended up buying an actual Cecil atomizer so before I get to the other half of the video I'm just going to take one more rip of this trainwreck through the dab cap through this guy cactus right from pepper and then we'll get to the other half so I will see y'all tomorrow Cheers [Music] and that really does taste amazing I'm very happy about this train wreck at least so yep see you tomorrow guys all right so rapid-fire review on both of these carts first off the Sour Diesel after changing it to a sea salt atomizer easily my favorite out of both of these this cart hits right up with the grates of this channel like the dab woods carts and the dank vape I'm going to show you it through the dab cap real quick and then I'll talk about it a little bit so Cheers alright so the sour D it's like a tank three rips out of a dab cap is amazing with this cart it's easily enough to get you a good buzz and even sometimes get you high depending on how long your hits are five hits and I am fried for a good two and a half to three hours I would highly recommend getting these carts but if they're fakes switching them to better atomizers because I'm sure they would hit better that being said the train wreck it hits alright just not nearly as well as the Sour Diesel out of that new atomizer that being said this one worked from the box versus the other one where I had to actually transfer it thoughts on this cart the highs are okay but they take forever to get I think six rips from this cart or what gets me high and I have to like keep smoking just to keep the high going um the high off of this cart can best be described as just feeling tired and kind of heavy headed but also relaxed so that was a good thing um the high on the Sour Diesel though was very energetic it helped me focus a bit so I was very excited about that but yeah let me go ahead and take a rip out of this through the dab cap just to show y'all and then we'll go ahead and wrap up [Music] so as you can see the cloud wasn't as good but it was still pretty smooth um but it's not really gonna get me high it takes quite a few rips out of this atomizer to get me high overall I would give the Sour Diesel in this new atomizer an 8 out of 10 and I would give the trainwreck in the regular atomizer a 6 out of 10 that being said they both got overall positive reviews so I have something special planned for our final hit we'll be right back so this is something I usually do for my friends on snapchat but uh I've hooked both of these carts up to the dually from hemp er and a dab cap so I'm gonna hit them both at the same time through a rig I'm gonna try to do a blinker so uh stay tuned for that let's go so you know nothing can mentally prepare me for doing this but anyways if y'all made it to you into this video thank you so much please like and subscribe and leave in the comments some ideas for other upcoming videos I have a few ideas but I'm always looking to like see what y'all want to see on the channel I plan on doing a timebomb for a thousand subs cuz we're about to hit that I'm so excited and thank you all for 500 like I think that time I'm uploading this out be at 600 but like I'm blown away by the support I'm receiving thank you all so much from the bottom of my heart and there's blinkers for y'all so let's go cheers guys [Music] compilation' bees", "Bq2J1yIaXBU": "so lately I've been really into these um THC C cell cartridges and there's been a lot of stuff on the news saying that a lot of people are breeding these things in getting permanent lung damage from these bootleg bunk carts you know so I'm here to kind of show you what a bootleg cart does look like these cards fit 8510 battery you know you guys are big bite and you're in your seaso palms that's a distillate right there when I got in there anyways these ones right here I've all bought in from the club's seasons I got black market these black market ones you see I open one up I tried a couple puffs off it didn't have any effect at all you can see you I'll show you Brendan this hood right here you see all the markings on it I've tested no pesticides but what's funny is this company doesn't even make these things anymore they went out of business for being you know testing too high in pesticides and and all sorts of stuff so they don't even make these anymore I'm hearing and only people that are making these are filling them up with fake distillates or whatever and making people real real sick because these are the ones my god they totally fake the strawberry cop hybrid that's a sativa it's not a hybrid it's more strong see so I thought oh it's California tested you know California that's some [ __ ] dude um the only way to really make sure you're not getting bunk carts like this is to just go to a dispensary and buy them and and even even then it's still kind of a fee like let's say look I got these buddy's brands that I've been smoking all these things are pretty good yeah you can see that they've been you know even with those markings right there you wouldn't even be able to trust it you know but uh it's but hey it's on there look there's the percent look here's a navy x1 this one co2 but you can see right there I've tested this one right here I got for all the cheap right there the dispensary here locally and kind of iffy what you can see has the real testing on it and whatnot these ones on the other hand they don't they have the steel you think it'd be real but you can get them on you know th Gator I like expressing and get these and fill them up with whatever you really want and people would think you know did you go to the clubs and you think the packaging is sick looks like one of those high-end ones look it's even got thick thick oil in there but bogus is [ __ ] did I never seems kind of expensive you're like Oh for the price of one of these I can pick up a [ __ ] grip of these but it's any worth it dude any worth getting sick dude you know just pay the money for it whatever you know you have a good hook up and good for you but you know just stick to these or get yourself a Carta just quit [ __ ] with the distillates altogether but you know I like my [ __ ] on the go too so it's whatever dude she so don't smoke this [ __ ] let me better look so you could see what they look like you know here's a bogus one not open here the one that I did open I kind of [ __ ] you fake-ass a brass knuckle thread I actually took out some of the juice out of this one we kind of like look at it and [ __ ] everybody has some it's all the carpets just [ __ ] way somebody filling the trash yeah dude someone's out there hustling this shit's crazy can't believe it it's kind of funny having one it's like a little novelty these fake-ass cards you know anyways alright guys well it smell good", "kA9eFpjdu1s": "what's going on everybody this is a big hope with Johnny also oil smokers only official there's triple og for your singles and doubles out there we just wanted to stop in and do a really quick review with you guys are these kind live resin cartridges you know well I've been on cartridges from the bottom to the top now I've been on cartridges since the Sooners they were able to start settlement down here Phoenix does the old fence declares the dogs brothers did all the way down the line and I got turned on to these live resin cartridges through high desert healing shout out high desert healing uh probably a few months ago and ever since then they're uh they're all that I wanted to smoke but first of all if we could take just a quick moment to notice the de atomizers here if you guys know some of the other brands you could tell that the parts are really cheap the atomizers are go out we used to bottle was hundred eyelid gram jugs all the time but a granddaddy purp and all that and a lot of times men you get back to the pad it wouldn't work at all no exchange rates no nothing like that this uh this battery anybody that has experience but I know that the battery is a tissue tool this kind battery here is probably about uh the the best that I'll run across but so this is the blue dream we'll give it a little ripping and see how it does so you see nice big healthy clouds but healthy clouds it's a so cleanness like the terms got washed down with detergent no life it's pretty but it's the kind live resin cartridges is a winner it's also a pro I've seen them at a lot of different places around I'm guarantee high desert hilling on Cave Creek Road go check them out headshot the game system you hit it or hold it you see this edge you see what's happening here this is the brand new man these are the DF cells here we're not even gonna tell you all about them this is gonna change your life man if you dab you're gonna have one of these in your home I promise you dad left until next time", "wR22bSFUvUM": "what is up guys so let's talk about eight cartridges there are good ones and there are bad ones these are called exotic carts exotic carts are there not even a brand of frickin there not even a brand someone or some group of people are making these wraps and empty cartridges and they're selling them on eBay I've seen as much as like 30 of them like 30 empty ones for sale for like maybe 20 bucks and so people are buying them on eBay or Amazon where the hell they're getting them from and they're just they're buying the filling with their own [ __ ] I mean you don't know what's in them like people could put three drops of actual waxman then they could just be taking a piss in it to fill it up like you guys don't know and these are not like these are not confirmed these are not verified these are not on weed maps these are not so that any dispensaries whatsoever the only places you're gonna find these are on an Instagram and like some dudes snapchat like seriously these are like the most booth carts ever and depending on where you live they're like different versions these carts um in California California are gonna be singing exotic hearts and then like Mario karts and then I've heard on the East Coast like I had one of my own that's um well fried and come from a legal state and he told me that they had a lot of Supreme Court's over there and they're really bad and yeah I mean people are making his fake raps boxes and they're freakin selling them so this one right here is this one's obviously fake and I've actually tried them on these before I tried like show you a few of these before but the thing is I've actually gotten from someone like a reputable source and even if he was filling them up with his own [ __ ] he was putting real wax in it because it was an oily it was actually and was okay it was decent once it was the best I mean he could be cutting I don't freaking know like I don't buy from anyone but this one was not from however this one was actually from a snapchat play you guys don't know those people they're basically if you ever go and snap shine you see these dudes I think they're all freaking cool they pull like they have like a bunch of these and raps and they like that bunch of these like old rubber band up and they'd be like $30 hit me up and they say it'll drive to you and show you it like yeah I don't hit those people up cuz they're they're gonna scam you like I've heard countless story of people around me like some dude got coconut oil and sparking cartridge instead of instead of like anything in it and like people are getting scammed left and right and yeah these aren't real and what's really funny is like everyone's treating these like it's like the Holy Grail and like cartridges when it's not like they're saying like this is like the coolest thing I don't know it's not like these are disgusting I'm I'm not gonna use this actually this is just for this like video but so let me read it for you guys so in the back it just has one grams and then you can see it the shitty fricking logo this is lab tested that's not true if you guys followed that dude I believe I won 500 or something on Instagram he posted the LS our test results from se labs and they have so many pesticides and contaminants in it it says all natural that's not true either obviously because if you read the frickin test results no PG and VG if you guys won't that is basically what they it's a filler it's what they like use vinegar like nicotine vape juice and it's what makes their like cartridge very oily and runny so if your car cruise is very oily and runny and it probably has PG and VG in it and this one cracks me up a hundred percent dink Wow like that tells us anything I don't know why they put that there but okay THC 80 to 85% okay that's another red flag it's supposed to like have an exact number it shouldn't just be like uh uh forty five to ninety percent like it's not even though doesn't say that and then here's another thing that really confuses people a lot of times people will see this and you automatically think it's real you know because it wants to focus they're gonna see this and they're gonna think it's real that's not sure and stamp this on obviously and then it has like the don't drive and machine your hit rate bubble blah and yeah so let's get this thing open one second anywhere it's nice going oh alright so when we open this thing I see a lot of red flags and I'm not sure this is just different but I've seen other or the other ones have gone they've had like the round tips instead of a flat one so I'm assuming this isn't like the actual when they came with this because when I was on eBay looking at these um they actually had like the round ones and they look completely different like see like notice this when there's not like a bar in the middle right the coil is like I think the coils light on the bottom I don't know it's very weird Victor Ilya looks very freakin weird it didn't come with our rubber piece by the way yeah I'm not gonna use this obviously I just bought this for this video but that's gross and these fingerprints are mine by the way because I was like trying to inspect ooh so anyway all righty this is obviously just very runny to brown like it's like stained Brown and I don't know I got like had carts before and like if you like leave them somewhere like for a long period of time they will turn brown so I'm assuming this has been this guy's car for well god knows how long so it's great um I'm sure that would work if I even plugged into the battery just a freaking typical screwed up so yeah this was obviously looking used there Eddie that's great and before you guys think I got scam it's not sure because these were all sold like together so whoever like fill these up use these cartridges and said that's great hey guys so yeah these are freaking everywhere my advice guys is just do not use these I know they look and they look cool like they didn't number one they also don't taste like than what they say like this says um strawberry shortcake this thing smells like green apple like what the hell I don't so as obviously was filled up by some over the homemade um also they have their Instagram page on it and yeah when I went to go look up this account there were a bunch of other accounts and I know when was which and it was even verified like the blue verified cheque none of them had it so I didn't know which one was which so I only assumed the one with the most followers was like the right one and they claimed nothing for sale but yeah I mean how else are people getting the [ __ ] because yeah guys so exotic arts don't buy them he's [ __ ] hot dog water like everybody says seriously like stick to roll I mean personally guys I use these because I don't know like he's worse more convenient I've heard a lot of people say have benzene in it I mean I don't know I mean I got this 425 from like week Maps so I wouldn't say it's fake I mean the bubble does take a while to go up I'm not sure guys but honestly if you guys want something like a hundred percent clean a hundred like no pesticides solvents I'd honestly stick to Rove I've tried those those are pretty good too the only problem with Rose is that the gel was really thick like the oil from robe is so like thick like you see this and you're just like it's so oily and then when you're like look at a robe it almost looks like gel and you have to like sometimes preheat the frickin thing northward to work and sometimes you could burn it out because you had to preheat it so yeah guys well thank you guys for watching they just were like you guys should just watch off this [ __ ] just needs to honestly be spread around more on purpose of this video was to raise awareness about this this is becoming a huge problem like almost has that jewel [ __ ] epidemic but people really need to like know not to use this [ __ ] like to hit us like this is so terrible I can't miss go so disgusting these are yeah like the site and the right freaking the carters I came you know I pointed guys just don't if you guys don't know I just want to keep smelling good stick to medical or if you're another illegal say just hit up someone you can first church for us and like make sure it's a brand like brass knuckles heavy hitters like those brands you know heavy hitters does have like even known for pesticides I'm just talking about like brands you'd see out of dispense really make sure they are at this recipe and make sure you get like the correct one so I'm saying guys well thank you guys for watching and peace", "QLThWqhLTVs": "what's up YouTube it's a bee 420 with another blog you know what the [ __ ] it is

we just got done shopping at the new Terrapin station the grand open on Mississippi here in Denver and as we were walking out we ended up seeing the little table for sphere X okay they have a they set up distillate cartridges one of the good things about it is that he were about this that he was shown is it's got five separate holes down at the bottom which allow you to it actually gives you a bigger hit show you right now it's very smooth to hit there's no button to turn it on you just charge it and you just go so the distillates we got today we got a mango Kush vape this is what it looks like the 500 milligram and what it says or what he was saying is that they reintroduced terpenes into it so you get most of the you know a bigger bang for your buck stuff like this the mango cush is a hybrid and as you can tell I'll show you what a big root looks like so this think it's pretty strong it's smooth if you get a chance to check it out it's spheric s-- no button batteries cartridges are easy there's no refill so alright see boy hey man y'all have a good one", "zwhc8vEiV9w": "welcome to a community cannabis review today I'm gonna be making a quick little video nothing too in-depth I mean making a video on a brand of concentrates and cartridges we have here in Oregon called hush brand they're a very very low end bottom shelf here's the sticker that I was able to take off see that $16.66 that's med taxable Eve's like 20% here so comes off to $20 out the door for these cartridges this is a package you can you get them with I get with them rather hard to see towards detail there might be able to focus it perfect so I used to not get these because from I I could have sore they used to use non cannabis derive terpenes which I am NOT a fan of I don't trust them personally but ever since I want to say about like six months ago there was a nationwide and Oregon also had its own flavouring band for vaporizers and this also covered cannabis products as well apparently so ever since that happened you have a couple brands that were lower end but I usually didn't get like hush Mojave because from what I knew they used non cannabis derived terpenes it's not the case anymore so these are I'm gonna give them an another try to see what I think this is UK cheese how it comes well pretty standard card packaging they're got a rubber caps on these end up it in the vessel when I started on two point seven volts it's a really nice flavor kind of neutral it nothing stands out really but it's very nice I don't know if that's true that UK cheese I've only had one cheese straighten and it wasn't UK cheese but it does taste like that strain I will get at that I didn't expect the terpenes to be on point but I really think they might be no bad I'm gonna bump it up to I believe 3.7 volts now give it one last hit if I can get my vessel to work there we are I don't know how to work this thing sometimes I mean that's a great taste I'm really surprised for 15 16 dollars for a gram that's really nice it's surprisingly nice so calm I'm gonna do another one of these videos here in a second on Mojave this is a live resin cart that well you know I'll get to that in the video so hope to see you on that video and I'll see you next time on community cannabis review", "-gdysmn5LEE": "well Aloha brothers and sisters welcome back to the channel it's your man Kimo back to do another review for all you cannabis enthusiasts and connoisseurs out there this time I've got a 5-10 thread of a cartridge coming to you from Palmetto cannabis that's sundial cannabis company it's agent orange it's a sativa hybrid stream it's coming in at 800 milligrams THC and one point two six milligrams of CBD so that's about 80% THC and less than a percent CBD so it's gonna be a high THC heavy-hitting cartridge really excited when I bought this I'm gonna admit I cheated a little bit I did buy it a few days ago and I was excited to try to open it up I've been faking it the last few days stuck it back in the cart in the container here to show you the package I'm gonna hate this packaging it's awful I'll show you on the front it shows to open the package you push it on the sides and you push open the top it's easier said than done like I was pushing pushing pushing I'm glad I didn't record the initial truck time I opened this package because it was real futile effort took me a while but after a while I just find out that usually if you play enough pressure on the sides and push in and pop you can open this packaging is horrible I can't stand the packaging and then when you do open it up you got your car to gene there it's nestled nice and safe away in this foam little cutout but it's straight through for me because you want the orientation of your cartridge to be upright and by having it designed in here you know this is probably gonna sit on the shelf like this or like this and your oils gonna be you know on the side it's gonna potentially clog or plummet your device not a cool design choice Palmetto I don't like that at all you know and strike three for me is this packaging big hard plastic and flung away what do you need all this packaging for this little device I don't like it you know it's it's horrible to me so packaging no good Paul metal so once you open it up though you do get this lovely little cartridge hopefully that's coming in nice and clear you see it says Agent Orange on the bottom and what I think is a really cool retro font I'd it the big bold letters you see the oil in there it is pretty dark doesn't move around a lot as you can see I've aped a lot of this the last few days it's a little dark almost kind of orange I'm wondering if the glass is actually tinted orange to go with the whole Agent Orange vibe I don't know let's get these rubber nubs off here with a mouthpiece condom get the battery put it on we're gonna vape a little bit here I've been vaping a lot of this I got some opinions on it but let's just take a rip right now as you can see is not a lot of vapor production it's not like a lot but it's enough gets the job done it is a little harsh so you can tell you're taking a drag that's one of the downsides to it after about four or five drags it gets a little harsh on the throat and I have coughed a little bit using this over the last few days but the taste you do get you're expecting orange oh you're expecting well Agent Orange gonna be citrusy orange II yeah not so much there's a little bit of a citrusy orange on the inhale and on the exhale it's a little tiny bit is there but it's mostly a kind of spicy peppery flavor cannabis flavor mixed in with the orange so it's a little bit sick you see with kind of spicy on the inhale on the exhale you lose a little of citrus and it's mostly just kind of a spicy peppery flavor it's not bad it's just not orange or really citrusy it's alright but like I said it's a little harsh so if you're going if you're really reefing on it you could COFF a little bit and you might feel a little irritation in your throat that's kind of the negatives the positives are the effects this this hits really good I find it to be a bit of a creeper strain don't really notice the effects for about 10-15 minutes and then all of a sudden you feel a Deadhead band effect come on and it comes down over and your smile comes up and I travels down your body and you feel energized and focused though like it's a really clear high you feel really focused and clear but you feel kind of happy and just like an overall general mood you're not really hi you got a bit of a headband effect but you're really focused and clear and just happy and conversational sociable it's a good get things done strains 50 times training good wakey bait string good any time stream however I will say that if you really refine it it kind of overdo it a bit start getting into you know quite a number of drags when the effects do kind of start to take over they're pretty intense at first and you know they wear off after a few minutes and they they develop into that sort of really focused clear high but you can make this pretty intense high it's kind of fun if you really want a refund get a little stone this is a great anytime babe because like I said it does dissipate into sort of a clear head in it you know certified so you're not all stony all day this this is great anytime Cape I would recommend it it's a good value it's forty five bucks I paid for it and you know it's point five grams it's gonna go about as far as any other 510 0.5 gram cartridge out there it depends on the use depends on your mileage mileage berries with you know how much you use it in your experience so thumbs up I recommend it I really like a good job Palmetto cannabis changing down packaging I can't stand your packaging I really like your cartridge I really like your oil I really like the Agent Orange pick it up if you see it it's a good deal that's the end of the review

fake ones it doesn't move worth the [ __ ] I kept it upright just to see if he'll go back and it really don't even move I've had him for a bit so I don't know if it liquid hardened over time or what I got this new King Louie from a reliable source today he always got good [ __ ] no I told him about the dang babes it took me a minute to find not even really it took me about a week to find another dang cartridge from another person so I wanted to see you know the difference that's why I'm doing this video for you and like I said man the boxes to the boxes are the same and this one the cake pops all the logo pops off same thing and you got the little logos on the side the cake pops off here so I don't know how to tell him apart but I did have a good tip from a viewer on my previous video on the dank cartridges and he was telling me that the color of the ring on the bottom is it easy in the he said the fake ones were to be white and the real ones clear so see this is the yeah this is the fake one and I know it's fake I tried it I hid it and it does not it's just not it's not legit man let's see we got the ring there it's white the ring is white and also I've had other cartridges this little gap here shouldn't it should be like pushed down so that was another thing I've been looking but so this is the one I grabbed today the liquid looks legit the bubble moves a little little quicker and it's not too thick but I have had cartridges where the bubble moves fast and it still gets me guy and see the thing right here look at I said I don't know why this has more of a gap to it here they look damn near the same in color though the green on the bottom of this one see then you got we got damn got writing on this year seeing this is clear too this is why eNOS is clear I hope this will help some y'all out there man I don't know he looked down I'm saying but I'm about to try this one right now the only difference right here is the inside ring they're clear you got a little

cartridges used for vaping they've soared 400 percent between 2015-2016 so in one year quadrupled vaping has made marijuana use more discreet it's more convenient and it's free from the STONER stigma attached to smoking weed but and this is why we're talking about the jury's still out when it comes to the safety of vaping marijuana some studies suggest doing so may be toxic dr. sue Sisley the president of Scottsdale research institute they do conduct clinical trials on marijuana she joins us now on these findings and I'm glad we're talking about this because I will openly may I don't know about the three of you but the whole concept of vaping with cigarettes we understand but I am oblivious to the health consequences benefit whatever it may be when it comes to this so people think it's healthier but maybe not so fast you're right we don't have any data about the safety of using or vaping these marijuana oils and those cartridges up there are great exact Emma Colette when exposed to heat these chemicals can turn into formaldehyde so you talk about propylene glycol yes so you're more concerned about the additives then the marijuana oil itself exactly right yeah these chemical additives have never really been tested for safety the FDA has confirmed that they're safe for consumption but just because it's safe to eat doesn't mean that it's safe to heat up and inhale it's a different story and the fact is if there's all these flavoring chemicals in there as well you know these they try to add flavors to the cartridges to make them more palatable but what happens is that those flavoring chemicals have also never been tested and for heating this is part of the concern as well is that they look more glamorous so again it really reduces that stigma it makes it seem like it's a really fun kind of upscale thing to do right safe um and it popularizes it which i think is part of the problem right until we get more data I mean what's the take-home here for for people that are that are vaping on a regular basis the good thing is you have all kinds of other options now in these regulated markets we have the opportunity to vape natural flower so if you can find you know the the actual plant material that's not been grown with pesticides which is a common now because we have the the newly legalized states I'll have you know required lab testing so they don't allow products to the shelf with with pesticides or other chemicals but the problem we have is these older states you know the states like California Arizona Michigan that legalized marijuana years ago they did not require lab testing that's why it's so important that you're notifying your viewers about this issue because they can still find these vape cartridges so I just so I understand this if you're in say Colorado and you are a recreational marijuana user where you can go into a store in virtually any city and purchase it vaping there is in your opinion probably safer because they've actually tested the chemical additives that's right yeah and that's what we're trying to do with all these legal medical cannabis states is force them to lab test all of their products so that we can make sure to protect patient safety because you know the issue is that they could be picking up a product that does have these chemicals and and so I'm grateful that you're alerting your your viewers to this because they can avoid this they can pick up a vape cartridge that contains nothing but the what nature put in the plant now that would be the ideal situation pick up current and eventually these cartridges will not be bought by people when consumers get smart about this they'll bypass those products and eventually they'll go away I want to ask you this off the cuff because marijuana legalization is so new people who are naive to it maybe they go to one of these states where it's legal and like you know what I want to try it and they have the option between smoking marijuana the old-fashioned way they have edibles of a whole host of different types of edibles they now have vaping as an option in your opinion what would be the safest method well you touch on you know two big public health problems right are the overuse of edibles and the excessive vaping of these oils I mean the truth is these oils are hyper potent some of them contain 70 to 90 percent THC so people can easily get intoxicated on them so the key is always start low and go slow yeah - and that is buyer beware", "468eEqu9mmU": "hey guys what is going on today we're looking at another cart another TKO Sox cart I did another video on these except it was the makers of GG for flavor but these are very good um one of my favorites for black market carts anyway I want to make another video because pretty soon these tubes are going to be changing it's not going to be this child block thing it's gonna look like the normal TKO tubes just like a darker color so if you see this after that after they're released that that's just what's going on but um I think this straw Nana flavor I think it's I think it's better than the other one I reviewed the gg4 and I've hit a few other ones and I do think this is the one but the best one by far but um if you look at the wax or something I think it's pretty good it's like I'm it's a very natural dab flavor which is kind of what I look for in a cart to be honest in TKO you know obviously as we've gone through a lot of stuff right now but still very high quality product I'm not a fan of the know they're normal carts but these soft carts I think there are some of the best black market carts like out there to be honest there's not another kind of cart that's not from a dispensary that really hits you like this does and really tastes like natural dabs and I'm sure it's not the most safe thing I'm sure there's a lot better alternatives but before if you're on a budget and you don't want to go out of your way stand in a really long dispensary line to wait weeks for something if you just need something immediately I think this will definitely get you through the day or the night ever would after you use it for if you do pick one of these up I definitely recommend strong Anna for sure or the choclo that one was really good too but yeah they this company they have a website or I thought they did but cuz they keep their Instagram kept getting taken down and so I thought they made a website but I just cannot find it so I'm thinking maybe that got taken down to these carts and may not my my assumption is that these these guys are not going to around all that much longer so definitely try one but definitely stay safe make sure it's real compare it to other compared to this video compared to Instagram if you see them on there I think they're there Instagram but back up at this point but make sure it's real if it's fake if it tastes weird if it tastes this is gonna taste natural it's going to taste kind of like dabs very earthy I guess you could say if it tastes funky to you if it tastes if you get a bad feeling about just throw it out just just save yourself the lungs ear lungs and your in your heart just throw it out please for God's sakes there's so many horrible carts out there and horrible fakes and you could make the argument that TKO in general is fake the whole company's fake because it's not the ones that are in Cali in the dispensary but if you are getting this branded TKO be very careful and that's all for this video I have a discipline sweetheart video didn't come and sooo now no when whenever I feel like making it but yeah drop a sub for more", "VEDOA_mbcW4": "[Music] I woke up today said I wanna be a star walking down the street and all right to be doing a review all right here on the Bulldog extracts bringing break out another to see bubblegum oh gee I have used this and I've had a syringe of this before open if there's a like the rubber protector right there I have it already in this level G looks like very thick this litter ping mix I'm just gonna be dropping it in here nice try some Los Angeles top foreign and they would have get this off of sailor Nash's hitting it on the blue voltage is three point five volts and literally tastes like lemon go it's for the Endicott effects because after that I can my body did go for walks they are dressed like you're dying effects like I've giggles bitte munchies a bubble in the Delta it's like a good hybrid indica because it's knowledge you don't feel nothing else all you're not trying these are solid the karcher don't think it's like whatever officials see so if they just come from custody for thumbs ones room perfect it's about to be summoned three in a row of three round bursts I've greatly - attack - fine impression but but here my shots of the flesh [Music]", "bzGdyneMAzU": "yo yo yo what's up G fam today guys hoppin straight into it it's been a long week for me it's been a stressful week for a lot of people guys I don't know if I'm ready to get into the situation to the topic yet I might save it for another video you know it's still kind of early but this week has been a rough week guys that's why I haven't been able to produce any content or anything like that so sorry if you guys haven't missed it on the videos but today I'm bringing you guys a quick [ __ ] the last the last of the tree-based guys tree-based clear the best one agent orange like literally probably by far the most potent one the most the the best-tasting one and the one that gets me the most [ __ ] faded so this one right here is a hybrid I didn't think a hybrid would get me that [ __ ] up but the times that I've been smoking it and everybody that let hit they're like [ __ ] bro this is literally the best the best one ever so yeah guys this is the packaging that it comes in it's a better upgrade than what they used to have they used to have just the regular little plastic ones where you could see through and it's like right there but you know got a step your game up if you want to being the best and then this tree I suppose they come in these little [ __ ] clear tubes and all professional so yeah guys Agent Orange look at this [ __ ] um I'm more than halfway through with it already look how clear that [ __ ] is you can see the holes everything like water like if there's nothing in there but yeah guys I'm pretty much halfway done with this and man like I still haven't gotten tired of it I'm not gonna lie with the other ones with the Mendo breath with the Wi-Fi og I got tired of them pretty quick I got tired of them within like 2 to 3 days and I was just like [ __ ] do you like on time I'm just waiting for the next one so this one is [ __ ] bomb though this is by far the best one Agent Orange you guys when you take a hit of it it literally takes like alright you guys know one you guys are gonna open a brand new [ __ ] fresh orange peel that [ __ ] that first little peel and you like you take a sniff and it's like orange peel like I don't know if you guys like that I mean it I like it so that's what it tastes like guys it's nothing artificial there's no official flavoring like just like a little hint of like orange peel that's probably why they call it Agent Orange and [ __ ] it's hot today sorry guys I keep wiping my sweat off but it's [ __ ] hot today it's already [ __ ] 4 o'clock and it's 93 degrees though so we're gonna smoke on this [ __ ] I tell you guys how I feel I'm sober right now so I'm gonna tell you guys how this [ __ ] makes me feel what I like about it what I don't like about it and we're gonna go straight through the review guys so turn off the [ __ ] air real quick so you guys can see these fat ass clouds and this one actually produces a lot more vapor than all the other ones I'm not sure why but it produces a pretty good amount watch [ __ ] delicious and what I like about these cartridges men but to never it's never a boring hit like even though I didn't like the men doe breath and the Wi-Fi og that much I still enjoyed them just because it was a really strong high like compare compare it to like brass knuckles and heavy hitters and all those other shit's like this is pretty top-notch quality and I understand why you have to pay $40 for half a gram you know I I mean I do kind of wish it would be a little bit lower maybe in the 30 35 range because 40 is pretty absurd like you can get you can go out and get yourself something not as good but pretty much up there in quality for $50 full gram and this is 40 for half gram so it's kind of like you know 5050 this is definitely after trying all four of these and after having these for probably like two weeks I I'd say if you have the money go ahead and go buy it if you don't have the money don't don't sweat it you know you I'm sure a time will come when you'll be able to afford it but don't be killing yourself over this Sh it's definitely it's worth it though it's worth it like I'll tell you that it's definitely worth it if you have the money and you're debating it what should I get is it worth it yeah it's definitely worth it and I've tried pretty much for now I'm pretty sure I've tried every single tree based flavor that on the market that they have I think the only one I haven't tried it is the gelato but I'm not really a fan of gelato wax cuz you know for me I like smoking the the real weed from burner for a more originated originated from so I think everything else is pretty much a knockoff so yeah guys so we're gonna keep talking on this I'm outside the gym right now and put it I'm gonna hit the gym after this [ __ ] this [ __ ] always has me feeling good I go into the gym and I just like get in my zone and I start working out guys so if you guys are 18 over 21 and over whatever it is in your state and make sure you guys are smoking along let me know what you guys are smoking on in the [ __ ] description I'm about to turn the [ __ ] air on his hot and ya guys Cheers mmm all I ever take is like probably two to three hits max to this because it is potent like like I said in last video guys this [ __ ] has to be the most herpes cartridge on the market like the hit that you get from it it's like no other eye I've smoked so much [ __ ] in my life nothing nothing hits me this hard no no I mean other than like dabs and [ __ ] like that but like from cartridge wise this is probably by far the best one one thing one thing guys I know I know some of you guys might want to wait for this but I know they they just announced on their Instagram that they're gonna be releasing one gram cartridges and I'm wondering I'm trying to guess how much with OSHA's they're gonna cost like you think they're gonna cost the same amount they're gonna call as like two of these would cost you know $80 [ __ ] $75 but I don't know guys we'll see we'll see what they [ __ ] decide on what the pricing is going to be hopefully it's not too much because I know I know usually come B's charge for the cartridge itself because I know the cartridges are pretty expensive they're like 5 to 10 a pop I heard and then so hopefully it's not that expensive and we're gonna take one last rip of this guy's hopefully this coming week I am able to do some more content it's still gonna be a pretty busy month in my in my opinion we'll see how it goes but yeah it's good I'm soaking to be pretty busy guys but now that I'm reaching I'm getting higher in my um subscribe go and view count I know my evaders I've been popping off lately and I appreciate that I love you guys shout out for all the people watching my videos commenting on my videos you guys keep me [ __ ] motivated and keep it going and I wanna probably soon pause I started maybe this week next week I don't know whenever I find out I'm I'm probably gonna start live streaming for at least an hour to two hours a day I want to start streaming probably for at night and might be streaming the new blackout if you guys would be interested in the new color TV for I'll probably be streaming that [ __ ] and then cuz I what what my plan is now that once I hit 100 I wanted that that pretty much gives me a decent amount of people that watching me I would say you know 100 people so every time I livestream I were to get a couple like 20 30 or whatever the cases and basically what I wanted to do is just live stream and have more people from other communities like the Fortnight community come in and watching and check out my [ __ ] and let's see if they if they like my content and they go ahead and hit the subscribe button you guys know how it goes so you guys should be seeing some more [ __ ] like that I'm gonna probably be getting into more different [ __ ] I'm kind of getting over the wax game or the cartridge game because I feel like I've tried everything this tree base right here with best on the [ __ ] best on the market right now so I really don't know what to try man I know I want I probably want to head out to cookies because I checked out their Instagram and I saw that they have a collaboration with them with the G with the G pins you know guys are no little [ __ ] so you put wax pins and hit it they have a collaboration with those so I want to maybe go pick one of those up see if they're not a [ __ ] expensive there because they're shit's always are overpriced as [ __ ] to go run for like a hundred a gram is stupid but [ __ ] man that [ __ ] has me fade I don't even be able to go to the gym right now but yeah guys if you guys liked today's video make sure to go leave

that I got up in Finn and I've been waiting to even try these I haven't even tried it yet it's called Ursa extracts Ursa extracts this is live resin I don't think it has any additives or anything so we're gonna test these out I'm gonna put the link to their Instagram and stuff down below check those guys out there kind of a new wax I've never even heard of them so we're gonna try them out and we're gonna compare them to the raw garden we're gonna see which one's better but we got to pick up some more raw garden because this shit's done sup so about to knock on my friends door and he's gonna pretty much take me so I'm waiting for him he doesn't want to be on camera so using probably not gonna be on camera this whole time sorry guys but how you doing bro all my friends dog dogs except for me as you can see we're gonna get out of here soon guys oh I'm still mad I'm mad about these versa extract the only thing I'm mad about versa extract and I want them to explain to me is how how is this a gram when it's 659 milligrams of THC and 2.3 milligrams of CBD that makes no sense it should be a thousand milligrams all together for 1 grand if I'm trippin tell me I'm trippin in the comments but I'm pretty sure it's a thousand [ __ ] milligrams this is almost like I have [ __ ] gram it's like a big-ass bubble it in [ __ ] but it's probably hella good we don't even know if it's good so I don't even know but no cars guys new cards so we're gonna see what it is I'll get back to you guys when I faith back in you guys already know [Music] [Music] we just pulled up about to walk in here probably won't bring the camera in because I don't think they'll let me record even though cookies let me record inside there I'm still not gonna bring it in just in case you know I don't want to be awkward as [ __ ] but we're gonna go in here bro didn't get as much as I thought I was gonna get but here's Nicki from me this looks like he got the Mendel punch golden gold sauce cartridge strawberry banana cartridge and then yogi berry let's check this [ __ ] out [ __ ] was how much was that [ __ ] BAM 177 53 after taxes for three carts oh four carts I mean sorry four cards one two

even confusing but probably get the taste those later maybe finish lets me get some eventually and then he got the raw garden half gram comes in a smaller box probably wait a little bit before we try this you know so happy to finally find a better spot to do it nothing out here because we're still at the dispensary but I'm popular with these girls we don't see what's poppin I figured out that all the men dough like all the ones that have punches you told me to they taste better I feel like so if you're looking for a good rock garden flavor to get it has punch in it or some kind of berry in it usually those ones are pretty good honestly compared to banana bread definitely good banana bread was cool though I ain't gonna diss banana so we out and we're gonna get it we don't get it Ian soon we just gotta find a good place to smoke man all right guys it took [ __ ] forever to get back here but we're back and it's kind of dark so I'm not even gonna go outside and smoke or are we gonna go so I

you're taking a straight dab so I guess the live res like it has no distillate no nothing nothing at it cut it to it so it just tastes like straight dab it actually tastes pretty good it looks pretty good I don't know I like it but I could see if people don't like it because they don't like the taste and they're used to smoking like this Jewett's and all types of [ __ ] but if you're a person that's into [ __ ] taking straight dabs this will be the pin for you I feel like hold on I gotta get the raw garden stuff we got to try that we got it compared to the raw garden no one's better so far

I don't know maybe this won't even make the video but [Music]", "y5pW3XIVfjc": "all right I got these brass knuckles cartridges brass knuckle cartridges this one's a girl ugly number 4 this one is Sour Diesel this one oh [ __ ] I can't remember what it was it was something else originally smoked at all pop the cap off refilled it with a blueberry old gene from - bacon so the last thing in here was blueberry OG and all I did was I went to a shop in California oh my god this thing is by THC clear this one is a Private Reserve so it's 30 dollars a gram to distillate this is true OG I got a couple other ones and all I do is pop this thing off is unscrewed and then all you do is pop this thing off without squirting it all over the place all right hopefully doesn't look down on me so all I do from here is I slowly squirt this [ __ ] in and you don't really know how hard it is to do until you film and try and do it but hopefully fill in the camera you just got a drip this [ __ ] slow in here not down this tube but down the side of it up the tube is where your vapor goes on these brass knuckles so you don't want to fill that thing up with oil because then you'll just suck a whole bunch over the lots on V plural that is alright so syringe empty true OG and then now I got a field brass knuckle and just stick this thing right back on [Music] you just got to make sure that when you're twisting it that it's everything's flushed sometimes you'll get it fresh out of the container and it's not really flush and some of the liquid will act not like it some of your you know your concentrate will leak out I've gotten a couple with this [ __ ] not really centered and some liquid has escaped not a whole bunch to [ __ ] about but enough to get the concerned about alright so I just filled this bastard up now let's see if she works I mean I know sure were three point seven two point seven max 3.7 if you're going bolts you know for the lowest and then for your highest on Watts it's e if I'm not mistaken it's on the Box use a Chico so I got this [ __ ] at this I usually take about three three four to five second hint and she weeks", "DKOD64GSTvE": "I got blueberry strawberry lemonade and sweet melon shot - Ronnie ray and his grandma I love you guys [Music] [Music] [Music] this is for educational purposes only don't watch this video olestra over 18 don't smoke marijuana less you're in a legal state or have a medical marijuana card I don't know my personal information I know what's up guys running right back at you so this video I got another card review for you guys if you guys like these like car reviews and like weaved reviews uh videos like tell me down below in the comments so I know to keep doing them otherwise I won't make these videos anymore and I'll put more effort and content that you guys might put out content that you guys do enjoy watching so yeah let me know down below in the comments if you guys like these or not so I know what to do but this video I actually got a cart review like I said in the beginning a detective a few different strains from this brand ego lapse Evo lab I got blueberry strawberry lemonade and sweet melon so we got a sweet melon blueberry and strawberry lemonade this is the one that we're gonna review today in this video so uh yeah if you guys want to see a review for these two stumbled on ball I'm gonna do that the reason why I actually like got three of these is because they had like a fire eyes do they actually have it thrown off the next week's that's [ __ ] dope um we buy two of these for $29 each so I'm down to like 60 bucks they give you a free one it's like a free car and a free battery with it so this is the battery I had to open the battery to charge it when I made this video so a PI two cards you get a free car and a free battery so 60 bucks you end up getting three carts and a battery that's the [ __ ] CEO in my opinion um yeah that's the [ __ ] crazy deal so though they're only half gram cards obviously so but still 60 bucks for 1500 milligrams and a battery I mean you can't really beat that and this from a dispensary so you know it's like I leave some quality [ __ ] you know what I'm saying so the battery I had to open it up so it looks just like a simple stick battery it comes in here this was the box this is evil lab a battery that's pretty much all that says it's evil evil a battery that's what it says that's pretty much all the box that and then um inside there it came with obviously the little stick battery no little stick battery the charger for it I think it's just a regular Android charger the charges with and then it comes with a little instruction paper so it says uh to charge the voltage this fate battery has three temperature settings low is the green green light medium is a blue light and then the high temperature is a red light to change the voltage setting click the button three times quickly quickly preheating your batteries key to a quality burn to preheat the battery turn the battery on by clicking five times then press the button two times quickly to preheat for 10 seconds the user can stop reheat in my press in one time so so I guess I supposed to picked up the temperature you want low medium or high obviously and then a preheat it and then hit it I don't know that others like pain if you guys see my last couple reviews I didn't have to preheat it you literally there's no button or not and you just [ __ ] hit it so that's a little bit different oh I see myself with that in a second so the bag that I opened this up already um even like all I did is just slides up you see that's all I did I didn't really take it out of there but this is a really [ __ ] sick packaging I can look at this for how cheap this [ __ ] like how for how cheap they're giving this away like three cards for 60 bucks for the battery they look [ __ ] fired - like watch so this is the packaging obviously yeah let me show you the packaging yeah so this is the package in one more time for you guys evil lab strawberry lemonade down there contains marijuana keep away from children contains 500 milligrams and I believe these are called the Cuomo colors that's what the Spencer you're saying if you see you right there I hope that label doesn't have any of my personal information I'm not supposed to be showing you guys on it hopefully it doesn't and if it does please don't [ __ ] me over but yeah so 500 milligrams it's also a hybrid are you guys that are interested it's a hybrid cart so it's called a chroma colors by evil lab that's the name of them and actually I think these cards are extracted with co2 like in the house some companies a cracker or you know like there's a million different ways to do it now but I believe that these are these are co2 yeah I believe it you co2 come correct but don't quote me on that but I'm almost 90% sure basically everything thirty years ago so I guess it's tested at 80 percent THC yeah there's test results for you guys very interested all that [ __ ] and then I'm what school you just slide it out of here and I think this is though I haven't seen anything past this part I just let it out of here and I seen this oh yeah so right here I saw yeah you see this college car or co2 card you see what I'm saying so yeah I'm pretty sure it's me I co2 here's the little bum tube inside a box I don't know what the [ __ ] we want to call that so you pull that out nothing really inside there it's empty now evil laugh this contains marijuana keep away from children basic [ __ ] then again up their CEO - like I was saying before so yeah all you guys see this if you guys want you can pause this and read it I'm not gonna eat the whole thing it's just kind of going over the brand some of the other products they have and just some information if you guys want you can read that I don't feel like reading the whole thing right now do you guys yeah posit if you want today I came with that that was inside the tube and then besides for that use the cart so every they called what chromo colors or something like that I said every flavor cart so the strawberry lemonade is lemonade is obviously yellow no I'm saying blueberry is a blue the sweet melon is I got green I think and like just all the different flavors on the cartridge in the color so I think that's just like a little cool thing they do a little small detail that you guys really though the actual oil itself is really really really clear actually but you guys can see that tell me your opinion down below in the comments also there was the bubble so you can see I think it is the oil for like 10 bucks a car basically I mean I'm not complaining and I know it's my dispensary not I mean so I has to be safe so tell me what you guys think down below in the comments for sure definitely interested in knowing what you guys think but um let's just pop this [ __ ] off throw it on my new battery and see what happens sorry so we got those two yellow things a lot this is what it looks like without that yellow tips so I'm not gonna lie um this looks pretty badass like all black battery with a few labs and black card with like whatever color accent flavor you got and not I'm saying this [ __ ] is actually pretty doh so I guess we're gonna go medium so it's about to click it five times real fast one two three four five all right so it's on I don't know if you've seen it blank so let me wanna so click it three times one blue that's green ice oh I'm blue I don't know if you've seen it we're on medium set medium temperature so now I'm preheating your battery is a key to a quality burn to preheat turn the battery on my collecting five times and press the button two times quickly to preheat for 10 seconds all right so I'm supposed to preheat it before I hit it I'm supposed to I don't know I never had a car was supposed to preheat it before you hit it but no one to the red light came on that's a preheating it's bubbling up now I hit it I got you so it preheats and nothing you hold so obviously that strips I don't think I hit it all the way I don't know what the [ __ ] it felt like um I wasn't getting like at all like the curette airflow it wasn't hitting correctly that should hit smooth as [ __ ] um I definitely got the long expansion it did oh I did like hurt my chest a little bit like that just do you know I'm saying I have a high tolerance if you guys didn't know by now but this is a far as Cara I can taste the lemonade a little bit I don't really taste the strawberry lemon at least the regular lemonade really else I'll call it not a strawberry lemonade and they're gonna call it strawberry lemonade I really do they should have put like a pink color on it not [ __ ] yellow strawberry lemonade is pink not yellow but just my thoughts and opinions um I first said I mean I liked it it was dope $10 card pretty much I'm not complaining at all the battery into this [ __ ] looks sticky ribs I'm not 10 bucks I'd buy if these are in stock for 10 bucks for like every I would keep on buying these forever because you can't go wrong with this [ __ ] his fire was [ __ ] 500 milligrams I only hit it once but it's 10 bucks for this what the [ __ ] is definitely weird there yeah so 10 bucks for this [ __ ] is definitely [ __ ] worth it in my opinion um if you guys ever see that the owner area Duncan Copp lemon hey if you guys ever tried this brand and we don't belong the comments what you guys think of it let's hit it again real quick [Music] so that tasted like it was a little bit burnt I thought it off you seen that but I'll put it back on the low temperature heads up on the medium temperature I feel like that was I tasted a little burn so let me hit it real quick on the low temperature your sleep affects it taste or anything at all you know I mean you guys are smoked off I didn't say in the beginning in this video I always [ __ ] forget I should have edited it and don't watch this video Lester 1821 whatever the legal age is in your state or you have any medical merit or you have your medical marijuana card like I do myself um yeah just gotta say that [ __ ] to cover my ass I can't get this channel to lead it don't want a copyright strike you know how it goes so yeah long time that's it I was a lot Betty whoo all right so definitely got a lot more flavor on that um definitely got the lemonade tastes a little bit more tasted I think that I don't know if I did something wrong when I preheated it or well I don't know because my first time using this battery I have to give it a little bit more used to it but it does taste a little bit burnt um but I think I might that might be my fault I think I did something wrong but for 60 bucks for three cards 1500 milligrams and a battery I'm not complaining at all that was a hundred percent where is it the cart I'm gonna give the cart the oil I'm gonna give me like a 3.5 out of 5 it's not the best oil if you guys you guys seen my own select elite premium court views um those half gram carts are so [ __ ] fired but they're 40 bucks a half-round recipes right here these are [ __ ] fire this is actually pineapple Express I dropped the review on this I'll go watch that video if you want these are actually 40 bucks for a [ __ ] half gram that's [ __ ] expensive but these are so [ __ ] fired for the basically like a little bit more than the price of one of those cards you could get three carts of these with a battery you know what I mean so just personally my opinion I like saving money I like ballin on a budget you know what I mean so I would go with these but the oil is in the best I'm had better like I just said I said 3.5 on the oil quality but the looks like the aesthetic just like everything about it like just the way the battery looks the way they carved like looking complements the battery that [ __ ] gets a 5 out of 5 a [ __ ] it's sexy [ __ ] like you got a mitt but it's it's not the worst though so it's like I'll definitely wait rather I'd pay 40 bucks for one of these before I pay 40 bucks for a [ __ ] Mario Kart or an exotic card [ __ ] those so yeah that's that's one thing never smoked one of those so yeah overall reading the battery before I rate I mean first impressions on the battery I like the battery a lot I don't know if it's the car or if it's the battery that has that little burnt taste like I'm talking about so I need to try the battery on a couple other cards first before I can really give it a full rating you wanna mean but I really like it I like the way it looks like oh saying and I like how it has that pre he said and how it has three different temperatures that shit's all badass that little like burnt taste I don't know if that's coming from the car or the batteries I need to figure that out so I don't know right now I'm gonna give the battery a 4 out of 5 but that's really because I've only hit it 4 times maybe maybe once I hit it a couple more times might give it a better or worse rating I don't know yet the evil labs oil overall I'm gonna give it a 4 out of 5 - because the oil wasn't the best quality yeah I've had way better quality [ __ ] before in the past I've said but compared to some of other exotic all that [ __ ] this is some stupid fire compared to that [ __ ] for the price too though like at least I got a for 60 bucks for three cards and a half I mean for 60 bucks for three cards and a battery that's a [ __ ] stupid steal like you can probably find that [ __ ] unless you are you're getting some fake [ __ ] you know I mean like at the dispensary you're not really fun and you always like that of us it's recreationally legal in your state but that's the reason why I'm [ __ ] with it I like the price point on it some people it's like for people that are ball on a budget that don't wanna I don't have 40 bucks you spend that I have you know I'm saying so I think that should Stoke and they just look sick you know what I mean how everyone's a different color and the pack you know they just for and for how cheap they are to all the small little details they have that shit's crazy but if you guys ever tried the brand like I said time we don't blow in the comments what you guys think if you guys haven't just putting a video I guess tell you how many of your opinions and if you guys actually like like these reviews I might not blow in the comments like I said so I know to keep doing them not I won't okay so if you guys want me to all review these other stream cards the blue baby and a sweet melon so I'll get these out of five um I guess massage for that if you guys like this video big thumbs up comment like subscribe do all that good [ __ ] follow me on my Instagram at all money read please I'm not the hit 10,000 subscribers really really want to hit 10k you don't have to do but it'd be [ __ ] greatly appreciated so I visage for that peace out", "40UPmwIpak0": "oh gee shout to Ronnie ray and his grandma I love you guys [Music] [Music] [Music] this is for educational purposes only don't watch this video olestra over 18 don't smoke marijuana less you're in a legal state or medical marijuana my personal information alright yo what's up guys Ronnie right back at you so this video I got another car review for you guys I'm gonna be reviewing the same brand that I didn't like that the last to court review videos I think if you've seen him on Excel labs promo colors they just had a fire a steel so I picked up like I think six it yeah I picked up six cards in total so I still have two more flavors left of those to review so two flames I have left are tropical fruit and blueberry so I think in this video I'm gonna be smokin on the blueberry if you guys want to see a movie one in the tropical food and we're down below in the comments and I'll get that out yeah blueberry in this video so I'm not gonna spend I'm not gonna spend too much time going over a pathogen in this video I'll show you guys it a little bit better you guys want to see the packet more in like that detail go check out like I think it's my first or a second review on this company cuz I wanted like really in-depth detail on the packaging I'll give you a quick little look at it you'll break so the front evil labs blueberry contains cannabis so obviously um tested at 80% if you don't know how to use it it gives you instructions so and yeah so that's pretty much the package it's a half gram car the thing that I really like about these two um they're really really cheap I got doc they havethey oh I'm six cards you get six half gram cards and you get a battery like this battery right here eat more labs battery for sixty bucks so three cards and a battery for sixty bucks um I don't know if that's like ideal what they have like everywhere but at least that dispensary that I go to let the deal they have right now so oh yes I'm gonna take that off the battery so yeah this is battery right here this was just a regular stick battery evil laughs not I mean but uh it has them three different temperature settings low medium hot then it has a that preheating setting option where you gonna preheat your portal before you hit it to get like a full hit and yeah so I mean this it's pretty dope battery I mean you get it I'll be used for like the deal they have three cards and a battery for 60 bucks like 1500 milligrams that I mean like smoke shops usually sell these for like what 10 15 bucks so like I don't know how that's just like a fire SEO in my opinion let's just hop into this review with something aside this open this is something that I really like about this company really cheap it's like I was saying and they have all you small little details that are like fire like like I know this doesn't really like mean too much it's the quality of the oil that really matters the most but I I don't know I just always cool to have like some dope packaging make you know I mean so when you take a better uh yeah some once you slide it out it has this little part inside of that that has a evil labs this little white um container what do you call this so you open this up and the cards in here like I said to call the chroma colors yeah right chroma colors did I say that right I don't know but so every every every flavor comes with like a different color you've seen how this one is red so it has like a red tip blueberries blue I think this was sweet melon so that sweet melon was like a green that's just like another small little detail that they do that I think is like really really cool for especially at the price point that like I've been saying like they're so cheap and like it's all all those smaller details they do are like so dope and something else I forgot to mention it's actually a CEO to vaporize cartridge so yeah yeah blueberry cart here's little club close up of the oil said where's the public s so the bubbles right there this oil was like really really really big yes I'm down below in the comments what you guys think about the at least that looks to the oil I think it looks [ __ ] fire especially for being so cheap like I said uh you get three of these cards for 60 bucks with a battery like you really can't beat that the old my opinion and it's coming from the dispensary you're not getting it off the street so you know it's not like some fake [ __ ] like there's Mario karts or exotic you know it's not so [ __ ] like that it's actually from that's that's from like the dispensary so it like it has to be like umm Sayyaf II know what I'm saying so so yeah so just pop these a little blue blue little caps off of here we got the card screwed on to the battery I also really love like the aesthetic like the way this [ __ ] battery looks with the card on it like I mean like with this blue I mean like yeah that [ __ ] looks [ __ ] fire but with it any color it looks [ __ ] sick I don't know tell me what you guys think down below in the comments like I said um this video was saying this is like my review video but I'm also really interested to know what you guys think of the products - so beep like leave your guys's review go in the comments even even though you guys don't get to like actually smoke on it like I'm doing I get it like you review on like the look since [ __ ] you know I'm saying so tell me what you guys think down below if you have tried them like if you have tried this company in the past I tell me what you what you thought at the Brian you know what I'm saying but with that being said I'm gonna put this on the lowest temperature so I can like get the full at the full taste the full flavor and I'm saying so we're preheating it up right now so that way gets the it gets ready for me to hit it so it's ready for me to hit it so cheers if you're smoking along with me let's get it the thing that I am found out about these carts is like if you really want to get the full full flavor like their folk well it's kind of common sense but um like if you want like the full flavor like they taste so [ __ ] good if you put it on like the lowest temperature and like you barely rip it like you just for a couple seconds like he's like you see nothin I didn't take like the fattest trip I just kind of like hit it a little bit to get like the taste you should taste like a [ __ ] vapor oh it doesn't even taste like the wax like it tastes so good so flavor I'm already giving the flavor five out of five that [ __ ] was [ __ ] so far mmm what is that his like um it tastes so [ __ ] so familiarly I don't know what that [ __ ] flavor is but the flavor it tastes so I mean it tastes so like familiar like I've I've tasted this before somewhere like um it has like that artificial like blueberry flavor you know what I'm saying like that artificial taste but um like I don't I don't even know what the [ __ ] of your blueberry tastes like but like the article fit okay it's like the artificial flavor you're not I mean but it tastes like a really familiar like I don't know if it's like a gum or like a candy or something that that I had when I was a kid or what the [ __ ] it tastes like but I can't I can't think of it but I know it tastes like something that really really similar to something that I've had in the past but yeah like you know like the flavor on this though like five out of five like I said like it tastes like you're hitting a [ __ ] mod like oh my god I nicotine mug you know I mean like it tastes fire oh one of the best tasting [ __ ] wife spins I've had by far like a hundred percent um so I just put it on medium tempo I'm gonna take a couple fatter hits and get a little rating for the high the high I guess and the smoke so yeah Cheers [ __ ] I [ __ ] up on that one mmm that [ __ ] tastes so fire made that one more time so I mean you see it [ __ ] rip so like um the taste 5 out of 5 the way it smokes it gets 5 out of 5 the high they're not the [ __ ] best cards like I've had way better cards like if you seen in my last couple reviews I did a brand called select um select elite premium vapes um their cards are stupid [ __ ] fire but they're like 40 bucks for a half gram card which is like really really expensive but that [ __ ] is stupid fire um these are definitely not on that level but that for the price point [ __ ] is [ __ ] fire um if you ever see these in your area definitely pick them up tell me what you think of them or even if you don't have the chance to tell me what you think of them just [ __ ] pick them up because they're fire I'm not sure like but they have like their own store or what it is but I said that the price point on these were it was like 22 or 23 dollars yeah I'd definitely pick one of these up if you have a if you ever see these in your [ __ ] area definitely pick one of these up evil labs extracts are not just evil labs a cannabis and vault evolved that's what it's called that's that's the brand um yeah topaz packaging definitely picked one of them up you can't beat it for the price point in my opinion 1500 milligrams of THC a battery for 60 bucks that's that's a [ __ ] steal so the tastes on this is a 5 out of 5 but that's [ __ ] crazy I can't like it tastes [ __ ] insane the smoke do you see I'm getting like fat rips watch yeah so I don't think the camera really picked that up as well as like you could see it in person but this [ __ ] [ __ ] rips um this the way it smokes you get a 5 out of 5 to the price point 5 out of 5 quality of the cart like I said I've had way better cards in the past but for the price point I think in the past videos I gave him three and a half but after smoking on them for a couple days they're kind of growing on me and I come I'm kind of liking them a little bit more so I don't know just after smoking them for the last couple days I'm gonna I'm gonna raise my score up to a four so the so the high gets a 4 out of 5 and I guess I'll keep the quality of the oil at a 3.5 Obama raised too high though for so yeah I guess the overall score at the cart a 4 out of 5 that's like the overall score for the everything combined 4 out of 5 3 cards 500 milligrams each totaled 1500 milligrams and you get a battery sixty [ __ ] dollars that's how [ __ ] steal can't beat at my opinion definitely picked them up like I said definitely tried them out here's the brand I was talking about was select this is actually Paris oh gee yeah if you want to see a ever actually did a review on this course if you want to see that go check that out but like I was talking about they're [ __ ] a forty bucks for a half a gram but yeah those are stupid fire you can go check it out if you want the review but yeah like I said this card 4 out of 5 but I still have one more left to review so if you guys want to see a review on the strain or flavor of tropical fruit tumble down below in the comments and I'll get a review out for that and then they just got some new fire ass card set the dispensary right down the road for me someone pick a couple of those up if you guys want to see some more these videos um if you guys enjoyed these like car reviews or

thumbs up comment like subscribe do all that good [ __ ] it's been around here a peace out", "w-RrFVp7j14": "[Music] what is going on youtube it's your boy turpy time welcome back to my awesome medical cannabis review and this one might be a little long one because i got some things to show you some stuff to talk about uh and some dabs to smoke okay so without further ado i stopped at simply pleasure here uh in hagerstown shout outs to simply pleasure thank you guys awesome i didn't have what i wanted but i got some other cool [ __ ] which is pretty [ __ ] cool i did need a new torch so i picked up the new torches the first thing i'm going to show you i thought this was pretty [ __ ] cool it's these nuts torch and check that out these nice torch lighter professional butane torch right this thing is pretty [ __ ] dope they had a couple other um you know characters like mario and uh i i don't know any of the other ones i really didn't care to look at them because they didn't catch my eye but this one and mario caught my eye uh i think it's badass i did um already put some fuel in it so nice big torch right beautiful that's exactly what i needed so i got gotta get used to get used to that thing what else did i get here all right uh i did get a new optimizer for my puffco but uh i do not think it is the right one so i might have to uh take this thing back you heard me i might have to take this thing back if it works for my for my uh puffco thing then so be it i'll use it but if not i'm gonna have to take it back i'm saying that because the same pleasure i know how you guys don't like to take [ __ ] back ain't give me a receipt and even offer so i mean my shit's on mine everything's in the in the [ __ ] there you know what i mean but first thing i want to show you guys um of course the rig it comes with a a normal uh flower banger right the normal ass [ __ ] flower banger and the one cool thing is about this if you have a round uh cartridge not like this you might be able to do it like that but if you have a round cartridge you can actually put it in like that in your ball and uh take a pull off of your pen which i have showed that uh in previous fought videos i bought a new box of dirt wipes shout out to [ __ ] dirt wipes and go anywhere without [ __ ] some dirt wipes right all right this is the cool thing here so this thing is called a uh a reclaimed banger the lady lady at the head shop sold me on this i thought this is pretty cool aspect uh what is it yeah oh i'm sorry a recycler banger for dollars okay fifteen dollars i thought this thing is pretty [ __ ] dope so you guys probably seen it on on the on the net somewhere along the line you pull this little guy out there check this out right so you heat the bottom up it has this weird looking coil type i don't know thing in there right but anyway how she explained it you put your oil when you have to heat it up and as you're you're hitting instead of the the reclaim coming out through this bank going into your rig it goes through here uh or comes back down and then up and then back in so therefore you don't waste anything it's always a cycle of of uh catching your recline so once again instead of your recline going in through here it goes down and up and then back into the [ __ ] that coil looking thingy there okay here's the aspect of that 15 okay 15 i'm just gonna sit that right there in the thing all right now let's see the actual main piece what i got you guys ready you guys know meme i like i like my little uh my little rigs but i seen this i fell in love with the colors uh this was sixty dollars ready check this thing out man i absolutely [ __ ] fell in love with it my normal size rigs you guys know it's kind of like a beaker right a beaker style um yeah i mean it does remind me of my other one there with this type style thing there but yeah check that [ __ ] thing out right uh only thing i'm worried about is these little slits you see these little slits there if they get clogged with oil uh it's gonna be a rough day you know what i mean but you guys know me i don't i don't let my [ __ ] get too [ __ ] dirty but uh yeah so that that's pretty much what we got from the head shop so check this thing out yo this thing looks sweet check that out right right down now let me get the banger they come with a uh a carb cap you guys the carb cap here all right nice big ass [ __ ] bubble carp cap and right as long as it's supposed to go straight up and like like that all right right up in the middle boom so that's uh that's everything i got from the head shop i do not recall the [ __ ] price on uh the total of what everything cost but i do know the rig was 60 that thing was 15. um the [ __ ] puffco thing was 25. this was i don't [ __ ] know it was like 120 something 130 bucks but anyway here we go so i'm going to try this out for the first time i'm just going to heat it up i kind of like sterilize it a little bit i'm gonna put some water in this uh new rig here and uh we're gonna you know do a dab but before i i do do all that i do want to show you and talk to you guys about these g-leaf cartridges okay these t-leaf cartridges i am not rolling over bubble wrap rolling over bubble wrap i am not too happy with them liquid live carts by g leaf um they didn't even last me a whole day to be honest like they were [ __ ] the headspace is just [ __ ] killer okay i bought four of them actually i bought five of them but one was distillate but so i bought four of them of the [ __ ] live resin fse full spectrum extract cartridge right here's the la chocolate i saved this one because i wanted to uh like do like a little review on it right i don't know what this one tastes like but i will tell you the um the star dog was the only one i liked i didn't like the [ __ ] the uh what is it pineapple skunk pineapple skunk live resin cartridge i did not care for uh the taste was was that's that's actually a good one there the taste is just yeah it's terrible i don't [ __ ] there's another nation so i'm just gonna say like they're nothing compared to cresco cartridges um i'm gonna hold off from buying them from now on g-leaf like your live resin cartridge are [ __ ] whack and and to me it's a waste of money like i said uh i only smoke like when i'm on break like i don't smoke throughout the day like like a normal person would like that you know just constantly puffing these [ __ ] so like i think maybe i don't know it's i don't smoke a lot it's what i'm trying to [ __ ] say and it didn't even last me a whole day which is [ __ ] ridiculous but oh with that said i do want to open up this one on camera and give you guys my opinion on this one here okay so as you see it's not opened all right not open you're gonna crack this [ __ ] open bomb there it is now check out this headspace okay all these [ __ ] headspace or just killer i thought cresco was bad like my wife is really tired of me saying oh headspace headspace headspace but look at this look at that guys that's crazy now i could say oh it was sitting down inside yeah it was sitting down inside but still i can heat this [ __ ] thing up just a hair just to get it warm and uh you will [ __ ] see the headspace in it this is crazy like i know this [ __ ] sucks into the wick i know it settles and you know i know all that but i'm just saying like that's pretty rough guys you know what i mean you're paying top dollar for for your medicine like i expect uh i expect some some you know some full stuff you know what i mean can you really taste it but hopefully that that heated up enough i mean you guys can tell just about how much head space is gonna be right down to that [ __ ] base of that coil there i can't [ __ ] see it but while we're waiting for that to uh that bubble to go down you're gonna let it sit right there um stop hating on on geely [ __ ] live resin cartridges because they [ __ ] suck and i'm never gonna buy them again uh unless they actually change something about it but like i said the only one i did like out of those four is the [ __ ] star dog that one was not bad at all but getting into the tea leaf that i did buy i did buy a two gram jar of mai thai cured sugar okay and that is right here and i'll tell you what guys this stuff right here is [ __ ] fire look at it [ __ ] fire i would suggest if you got that on your menu from g leaf there in frederick or even in rockville go pick that [ __ ] up like asap once again i'll show you guys the numbers real quick there's that cart falling over on the side that's a wrap get that right there's the numbers stay stick okay so um i'm gonna go ahead and pause the video heat this thing up get this thing nice and sterilized and then i will return all right so i'm back we got that thing uh nice and clean and fried up toasted i've been downstairs rinsed this thing out got this thing on nice and clean nice bottle of water all right let's put some water just a little bit above that huh what do you guys think i know i think maybe i have too much maybe just a little bit too much i think just a hair too much all right i believe that's good all

you a list of our top five oil cartridges so that you have a good idea of what you're getting into next time you make your oil cartridge purchase all Auto draw batteries need a cartridge with the airflow hole at the direct bottom of the tank if you're wondering why the new vaporizer you purchased won't vape your oil cartridge this is usually the reason cartridge tanks with solid connective bottoms will not work with buttons vapes this is the ex1 plastic wit cartridge with a flat head tip not really known for its big hits and good taste but it's a tried-and-true tank that's lightweight with the leak proof design and they easy to feel blue plug system be sure to preheat properly with this system as sticker oils can build up to a semi solid state on the wick so if you're looking for a cartridge that won't shadow around it though this is the cartridge for you the ex3 is a glass cartridge with a surco me of fiber heater similar to coils this cartridge gives a unique taste it feels heavy and very well made the big glass surrounding the heater allows for durability and will give you a truer quality of flavor this tank has been known not only to vape oils but ejuice to this tank features two dual Inlet holes for lights and medium viscosity and because of the air hole at the bottom this can be baked with a south draw device the ex4 is a glass tank with ceramic heater it's great because of the rounded base the round base is great so that no oil or wastage get caught up there it has a wider mouthpiece than most cartridges so you'll be able to get more vapor production it features two inlet holes for lights and medium viscosity and yes it's Auto draw friendly as well next is the only tank on the list we need a push to fire base and will not work on buttons as vaporizers or batteries the ex5 ii need each pilgrim or epub done for inlet holes for mediums against viscosity the egg v improves on the cartridge game by allowing you to control the amount of airflow you get great for heavy hits and with the mouthpiece being the largest of the bunch the vapor production is completely customizable to your liking but if you're not going to use the cartridge for a while it's best that you completely close the air vent even more amazing is the baseless center post assuring that you get the most out of your cartridge and that no oil is left behind and last but not least the e a fix-all cartridge this ESL style cartridge is the best fit for even the thickest of oils it features four large two millimeter inlet holes ceramic oven thick glass housing and ceramic mouthpiece and yes it is Auto drawl compatible this glass cartridge is a ceramic oven so you know what's going to give you a greater taste than any whipped cartridge out there all these cartridges are no wider than any CSL cartridge on the market and can fit into any vaporizer with the bore of ten point seven five millimeters or less please keep in mind that the thicker your oil the wider inlet hole that you'll need so that the right amount of oil can reach the heater to be vaporized without getting burned keep in mind that you shouldn't refill the cartridge is more than three times to assure you're getting the best vapor production consider subscribing for more videos like this drop us a like if you found this video helpful and leave us a comment with your feedback take care everyone", "cVoQG7IDVD0": "hey again everybody this is Ken eccentric films and I'm excited to be back at you with another legal cartridge review here in Illinois as you can see this is a Lemon Drop disposable point three Gramm yes point three gram cartridge I didn't know they made them that small but you know it's a nice little disposable cart the first disposable I've tried here in Illinois and you can see it's in the matter line of products by far McCann which is a cultivator here in Illinois now in this instance I believe Lemon Drop is not a strain specific flavor but instead it's a kind of laboratory infused combination of terpenes for a sort of confectionery flavor I would say that flavor is definitely achieved it's got a delicious almost like that lemon head candy if you've ever tried those tastes just like that to me kind of a harsh hit but I really enjoy the high from it it very much that put me in a cerebral headspace where I was like really productive for at least felt like being productive and didn't want to sit still very sativa dominant in terms of the high for me but yeah great taste like I said a little bit of a harsh hit but I do like the disposable convenience and as you can see in this video here no external battery or charging required you just draw and you get a nice hit out of it and this stuff is good medicine now let's talk about price so pretty much the standard recreational price I'm seeing after-tax there's a little bit of give or take to this depending on where you're located in Illinois but pretty much to give in to price after-tax for these point three gram disposable carts is about 50 bucks which is an unbelievably horrible deal I can get full Graham carts for considerably cheaper that are just top-shelf quality from the black market which is the case for most people I know but nevertheless why I'm here is to document this legal cannabis situation here in Illinois and it's gonna continue to progress hopefully and hopefully prices will be less [ __ ] but hopefully this painted a good picture if you're interested in picking up this cart I would recommend it for it's great lemon confectionery flavor and its really awesome sativa dominant productivity inducing buzz that's all I got to say today though guys stay safe", "P0-MXzLxg5Q": "welcome to community cannabis review today i'm going to be doing a standing episode just trying out a couple different things and i just picked up about four new products so i've got quite a few videos to make so um first i want to start with dark star extract cartridge it's cured resin strain is blueberry wreck so i'll show you the packaging and then let's get into it [Music] hello alrighty so i should have cut the videos together so you got a good look at the packaging um let's get into it let's open it up standing right in front of the window and the lighting looks pretty decent making my eyes look beautiful all right so let's open this up this is dark star which is a line i believe by the producer northwest kind here's the cartridge itself they come in these little like cardstock containers that holds it in the container and pull that out you can pop that back on or let's take it off because i'm getting into the cartridge so here's the actual cartridge um this thing is looking very nice these cured resins always look really nice not too dark they have a couple dark ones but i don't buy them but most of the strains looking really good um this i believe let's see when this was made if i can figure that out um made 601 20. so yeah this is from the same batch they've had for a while but it's not looking too bad so um let's see yeah i think i can peel off the sticker i always do that just so you get a better look at the oil inside nice check that out has some really really nice looking cured resin bho so i'm going to pop it in my vessel that i got from the giveaway i'm going to take off the shield real quick so you can get a better look at what i'll be hitting i always have trouble when i take the shield the trouble when i take the shield off putting the cartridge in there we go so this ran me without tax because of medical 2250 um out the door program so let's try it out i have been doing a lot of distillate cards lately so kind of hyped to get into something a little more terpy it's very good i started doing this a lot more just well first because it's cheaper but also because i remember cured resonance stuff being harder to hit but this thing is so clear and clean like no resist well a little resistance like perfect amount though let me see if i can get some notes on the flavor blueberry wreck and by the way it's made by um the grow the grower was midnight fruitco um it's definitely a complex flavor that's always something right off the bat that i noticed with uh cured resin is it's a lot more complex than even live resins but especially obviously distillates i'm not getting a ton of like blueberry taste from it and try this again yeah i'm not getting a lot of blueberry i would say this is mostly just like mirror scene and cardiophiline um tasting something else i can't i think farnacin might be the other one that i'm tasting in there yeah i'm mostly getting i want to say pharmacy and mirror scene in there foreign to be like kind of fruity it's found in apples but it's also it makes up a lot of like blueberry strains and stuff so i'd say generally fruity and then a lot a lot more mirror scene i think the farnestine is kind of lower in there so um all in all though it's really really tasty of course you always hear me talking about like oh it's got a mirror scene or something like that and i talk down it sounds like i talk down on it but i really it's great stuff it's just that i kind of get bored because i'm so into hunting turks that that's the most common i think miracin's the most common terp out of any um so it kind of gets boring after a while so i look for more fruity ones or more i guess like rare terps um i learned an interesting thing that there is a terp called hashishin which is only found in hashish and it's generally used as a biomarker to detect if it's something came from hash and it's made from degradation of mirror scene through photo and or i believe photo oxidation a combination of light and oxygen but that's something that i don't know if i'd be able to find because it kind of comes from like badly treating the weed but i'd love to figure that one out i'd like to find some some hashishing extract around here or something that's where my beard looks white with this slate yeah i definitely got a lot of farnesing off that um i'm just thinking about it now actually blueberry wreck it might be like a blueberry strain which there's many i think there is one just called blueberry mixed with trainwreck because it does taste like train wrecks in my opinion um so i'd be in i'm gonna look that up after this uh video i'll find out i'll do like one more hit because there's not too much more left to say and i do want to try and get on some other videos because i got some interesting stuff i got two grams of buddies live resin got apricot glue and blueberry muffin as a matter of fact and then i got some full spectrum edible cannabis oil um the strain on that is mango kush crossed with strawberry guava but i've been getting into eating like concentrates de-carbing them and eating them in capsules and stuff like that and i used to not like edibles but that has really taken me by storm in the past week or so so i'll try out a proper edible experience hopefully i will get that whole video for you tonight and show you how i get it together and then also just what the effects i feel from it are give you a little more visual all right yeah so thanks for watching tune in to my um next videos i'm going to have out this i say this like every time but i know the video is a little less in production today but i'm going to try at least getting into the editing and figuring that out again with this video and then hopefully i'll have some more tonight so um all in all for the price these cards are solid i mean they're cheaper than most distillate cards they're like one of cheaper resin of any kind cards and really they blow me away every time so there's a reason i got into buying these for somewhat or so much first for a good month or two but probably gonna do that again especially now that i'm making videos for every strain i got i'll show you the package once more um simple packaging just paper and cardboard really but they include the grower info and stuff so that's really cool so thanks for watching like and subscribe and i hope you all have a great day", "7-kgAyDFpTA": "all right what up y'all welcome back to my channel shrimp life this is 18 over uh smoking channel but i'm gonna start doing other stuff on it my name is kelly if you're new to the channel thanks for clicking on it by the way leave a like subscribe if you want leave comments telling me what you'd like to see what i do wrong if what is a pet peeve of yours um yeah i'm just gonna i got a syringe i had a couple syringes i had a couple gram syringes skittles flavors i just squeezed the rest into this i got a refillable cart a half gram i had two full gram syringes i went through one and a half already this is the last half so i've decided to review on it i should have did a review earlier but i've been busy working trying not to get sick from kobe and everything else yeah and speaking of covet go in the comments below tell me what you've been doing if you've had it if you're staying safe how you're quarantining this and that and smoke along with me cheers this is skittles flavors so i'm just gonna give y'all a review about it it's my first time getting my hands on a syringe and i've been trying to so i was pretty geeked that's why i couldn't give you guys a video before i was busy freaking started smoking it right away for one but got a fully charged battery just filled the cart oh oh it's literally like you're hitting an actual dab oil's nice and yellow doesn't move super fast no i mean you seen the smoke can't lie oh my god the taste can't beat it considering it's literally a syringe the terpene profile is crazy the high those two hits filled in the head the eyes already i'm trying to give you guys more detailed um reviews i know i've been kind of lacking on the detail side lately but oh i feel it i feel it all in my face the whole i feel the head high is strong for sure it's a strong head high i get i would say i don't know like for the strand it is like i got drowsy like coming down like the high is good but coming down oh coming down makes it feel like you're about to crash so i feel like that's the only downside to come down from this is hard like hard you're going to be one to go to sleep flavor great every time but i've told you guys before i like that og gassy loud taste this is full for the person who likes that fruity terpy flavorful taste like every hit tastes like i'm chewing on a skittle or i have a piece of candy in my mouth like granted it's not bad i'm glad it doesn't taste like crap but it's just not for me like like i said that that's my pet peeve i'd rather have the more natural flavor cartridge or distillate over terpe and [ __ ] all that flavorful stuff from three hits in and oh i feel it and it's a waking big uh still so slow oh my god and for this out of a syringe i'm telling you the flavor is it's nuts like i didn't expect the flavor to be like that but it's crazy it's just like a dab oh and i want to show you guys this i just picked up some uh i want to say it's sugar but it's like crumble so i just no i'm gonna give you guys i'm gonna pick up the camera and switch it around for y'all because i want y'all to see this i wish i had better lighting to show you guys but yeah it looks crazy doesn't it tastes amazing i'm gonna have to give you guys a review on that soon too i know comment below if you'd like me to do a review on uh this wax i got it is really good i think i just hit a point two point one i had a point one or two earlier oh no just for the heck of it tasted pretty good though i'm not gonna lie but um i forgot to strain it i i had the strand name i forgot it you know i'll be smoking a lot so but if i take another hit hit or two for you guys and then get up out of here seven minutes in oh i should have my hands on these i should have my hands on more of them in like a week so more reviews or matter of fact i think me and brandon are about to do another half grade for y'all but this time we're just going to squeeze it straight in there so big reviews all right draw oh we get out of here y'all be safe quarantine if you get sick love y'all thanks for the support", "BMSzf_bzJ14": "and how's everyone doing today we're gonna be doing a cart review and this one I'm actually quite excited for it because I bought this just yesterday its indica Skywalker the eureka cart these ones are really high in potency and this is coming in that THC level eighty-seven point fifty-two percent THC mg at 875 points to mg CBD point twenty six and more CBD mg coming in at a whopping two point six feet before this vapor cartridge now we're gonna be unboxing it so it is but put some close-ups on the screen for you guys I love the box here because it actually is a really nice box I don't think you just will end up to the camera really does it justice so exactly a sense of what you hope you guys enjoy this for other people we just had you orgasm you I really do you don't really digging this packaging Buddhist oh my god its packaging you don't really get that you must get them in a vial or something this is how they normally are open so foggy we are going to a he's faking his reviews these things come like this artisan so this is the cartridge here it is a clear oil as you guys can see it clearly obviously explained the title of the video yeah it's real cart we're gonna try to get on this booze penny at really trying it at three point three votes if you guys can see that they're hittin this bad boy alright alright its baby boy hopefully you guys were big along with me and it's can to hit in this car [Music] [Music] first impression all right first impressions of this really good this is a really nice strong pool I like it it's a it's a really nice pool body's pretty thick I like that adds a really pungent and same taste to it this guy Walker by the way but now already mentioned that already but um yeah okay well after those two shitty ghosts um I like said this oil is pretty freakin dank it is pretty freakin fired I have really big dread medicated the Abbas's uriga high potency this thing is really hitting me right now and it's it's more of like um it's like it's like when you're smoking your Jordan or something it's not like an instant high like how you get with these fake cards out here that just have other stuff in it unknown stuff by the way I would just like to mention that just makes the effect of the hike um so much quicker than when it's actually supposed to you know but this one feels like I'm smoking like a blunt and it just comes steady and steady and steady and then it just hits me in the face when I'm just too baked and I'm really baked right now so hopefully you guys did enjoy this video leave a like comment and tell me how you guys are doing on this quarantine and yeah it's been your boy visa", "Bm-QYLkXvRU": "hey guys what is going on today we're taking a look at another card we're revisiting TKO actually but before that I think it was over like 85 or 86 percent of you that watch these videos are not subscribed so if you like what you see drop a sub anyway I wanted to go back to TKO because they updated their packaging once again I think it's only there I don't know I don't think they're normal karts are updated very much but these are their HT FS e sauce carts before previously they were in this with that child blocking mechanism but now they these kind of now look like they're normal cart you know capsules except it's black instead of white if you don't know what I'm talking about at all TKO has a normal cart version and then they have their sauce carts which I think I think are more potent they're more naturally flavored you don't really taste like dab flavoring they just taste like dabs and I honestly prefer them so along with these I believe they dropped a bunch of new flavors this is one of them I can't remember the other ones jet fuel OD I think was one of them but I honestly prefer this over the old packaging just because it makes it more consistent with their sauce and normal carts and Plus these were a pain in the [ __ ] ass to open I understand it's child's and so a child doesn't get it but still they're a pain in the ass to open but if you see if you grow if you're grabbing a soft cart and it does not come in this container it's either old or fake or anything like that in between but thank you guys for watching drop us up if you enjoyed yeah so", "UUEJMK1WCMs": "hey everyone uh this is luke with owls and today i wanted to talk to you a little bit about what is distillate first of all what is dystolos so distillate is the oil that you see in our vape carts um it is also used in our gummies distillate is something that is uh it's distilled right you you you see your um you see alcohol and they say like it's triple distilled so it just means it's more purified so for instance what you would have is you could have your preliminary extract that could be anything from an ethanol extraction to a butane extraction to a co2 extraction and the oil that comes out of there uh is basically distilled now what does that mean it's put into uh a boiling flask um uh and actually you know we can we'll take you down to the lab and we'll show you some of this stuff but uh basically um we uh we put that into a boiling flask and then the boiling flask uh is heated and when it's heated it goes up it basically evaporates and then it recondenses and when it recondenses it becomes more purified and it basically leaves some of the heavier or the the other cannabinoids that you don't want in the boiling flask and then the ones that you do want get purified and they get brought over here and there's also what is called a deep volatization that basically will also remove any of the volatile so for instance if you were to do an ethanol uh an ethanol extraction or a butane extraction when you put that into uh your your your for distillation uh the first thing that's going to come off it's going to evaporate first is going to be all your solvents so you can collect all your solvents in one area here and then you know that the the mains which is the good stuff is free of all solvents so let's take a trip down to the lab and uh let's talk a little bit more about distillation all right so here we are and uh this is a it's called short path distillation and uh and basically what is happening here is uh we have the boiling flask and the the flask is heated it's currently not doing a run right now but uh basically uh this is heated that heats the the contents of the boiling flask which would be crude oil or our conversion and then from there once that heats up at certain temperatures you will get evaporation which then will come up and it will travel down the condenser and then depending on um depending on uh where your ass will either be pulling you know the the volatiles it could be uh any solvents and then uh and then once you get off that then you get what's called your heads which is the the first fraction which again isn't really the stuff that you want and so from there you are able to purify the cannabinoids and then once you get to the end of that you can actually get uh i don't know if you're gonna be able to see it but this is basically we can take a video or a photo or something for it but uh you can basically see that there's uh stuff on the bottom here you're not gonna be able to see anything but um uh that's basically it in a nutshell so the the the undesirables are left here or they're or they're reclaimed somewhere else and uh the main uh the main parts of dislo is that's why it's called your mains um they are collected here and then from that i mean that's when they turn into like this you know so um that's how you make uh that's what distillate is and then once it turns into this purified oil you can then put it into vapes gummies edibles creams and so that's what distillate is and i hope you enjoyed the show thank you very much you", "3GYI4y5ZonQ": "Hey the jabbing eagle here coming at you I hope you guys have a safe Halloween I had a safe Halloween I had a fun Halloween I hope you guys have fun Halloween but let's start this video off with Oh big boy dad big boy dabs so yeah I hope you guys had a great Halloween I did and everything so guess what Red Dead Redemption to just came out not too long ago it's a freaking amazing game I freaking love it I'm giving it like a nine point six out of ten it's super super awsome let me know what you guys think it's actually pretty late here right now I'm doing this video very late it's it's almost about 2:00 in the morning but you know it's not a it's not a weekday so you know nobody has to work or anything so why not it's okay it's alright to be up at you know 2:00 in the morning doing some big boy dabs or you know some babes which I will actually review right now I actually got it's called a supreme vape pen supreme it's very awesome it's a 97% it's a one gram what I what I'm not really like right now it's it's a skittles I'm a big fan of the skittles it's really really amazing gots a great flavor taste if I had to pick one specific skittle that I thought it tasted like it would probably be the red skittle but then again you know it some people might just think it tastes like I'm all like you know when you get a big old hand full of Skittles instead of you just picking each one out like oh there's a red one and here's another red one get a nice big pile of red ones and you know in some you know you get somebody else might think it tastes like a handful you know the variety I know you guys know now I'm talking about when you grab the variety and it's just like wow you actually get the rainbow you get the rainbow instead of just like a red or a purple well that's like a grape or a green lime or something like that like no no no no no you know I think this tastes like a rainbow I kind of think it tastes like the red skittle but then again I love the red skittles I really like the red skills I'm the kind of person that will just be like oh [ __ ] there's four red skittles on top I'm gonna just grab those four and eat them yeah I'm kind of that guy that you know I'll leave your house and there won't be no red skittles left but hey that's pretty funny so that's uh that's what I kind of think about supreme you know vapin it's really really nice that's my review on it who knew that Eagles could like vape out their eyes yeah you know you know I would have never thought of that you know who big boy dabs big boy dabs let me know if you did a big boy dab today or even if you did a big boy dab this week just give him let me know because big boy dabs is kind of like almost everyday kind of you should do it but not everybody does it but you should big boy perhaps big boy dad's [ __ ] I would say you can even do a big boy dab with one of these things I mean distillates like to have so big boy dabs bigboy dabs hmm this really does taste amazing it's a supreme cart I mean I somebody told me I think today that supreme carts are kind of rare I really don't know if they're rare or not it's just what I'm always able to get usually so also anybody out there let me know if you think these supreme courts are rare or not I don't know just let me know what you think Red Dead Redemption - it is off the hook it's just I mean it's really awesome I've dropped many many hours into it there's way more things to do I absolutely love it and what I really love about it is when we're taking big for dads playing the game playing the game yeah Karen", "pqKqgShTRno": "[Applause] Choji shout to Ronnie ray and his grandma I love you guys [Music] [Music] [Music] this is for educational purposes only don't watch this video olestra over 18 don't smoke marijuana less you're in a legal state or you have a medical marijuana card I don't know my personal information yo what's up guys Ronnie ray back at you so I have another cart review for you guys in this video you guys see my last cart review item 9 labs I got another one like I said in that video um if you see my last one that was fire but it tasted like [ __ ] rotten milk be honest but it was always fire um but this one sounds like I should be how about better so I was let's hope it is it's called Candyland it's missin TiVo it's a basically meal when I went to the dispensary I thought the UM the shop that I go to with sky this sky dispensary now a2p out here in Arizona I go there like all the [ __ ] time it's like my go-to dispensaries like they know me really well um the dude that was helping me I know he's like a really big into wax like just like me so I pretty much told me to pick my butt to pick out his favorites for me cuz I know like he knows who noticed the fire you know what I'm saying so he picked me out his favorite the blueberry was fired I guess I've everyone has their own opinion so I don't know if he tasted that rotten milk flavor or maybe it's just my car or wherever the [ __ ] it was if you guys ever had the blueberry flavor of the item nine laps tell me what you thought of it down below but it was still fired as [ __ ] don't get me wrong but um we this one tastes a little bit better so here's the front of it we'll go over it real quick so so um it's item nine labs that's a Candyland that's the name of the flavor restrained whatever you wanna [ __ ] say um it's a 500 milligram cartridge one thing about these they don't say the test results on them I'm pretty sure it's a five when your milligram carts I know some cars that are like tested and whatever eighty ninety percent slow say it's five when you're over there like five hundred milligrams but they mean it's like five when you go around the fluid is that that doesn't necessarily mean that when you remember grams of THC and my being like oh that's a half a gram of fluid but the might only be like 390 something milligrams at ease you know what I'm saying that's what the other percentage is so watch out for that so I'm guessing that since this court doesn't have a test result I'm guessing that they just have exactly 500 milligrams of THC in it just like it says in the front and then it says um 100% solvent free and it's this late so it's fired and I'm saying so besides that the package is pretty simple besides just as item 9 lab see it and then on this side it has the website and then I say about Facebook Twitter and Instagram I guess it's just out of nine labs if you wanna go check them out that's pretty much it says the Teva on the top you see that nothing on the bottom here's the back one more time and Arizona Department of felt with one and obviously all that good [ __ ] so I'm just pop this open but before I do that what I'm gonna be using my um just like basic evil laughs and so this is like the like in the order one because they have this one you see my last review was just like all black this one is [ __ ] dope um hey I like this pen a lot like it's really it's lasted me longer than like almost any other pen that's around like this $10 range I like ever has like most like they usually lasted for about like three four months before they end up like breaking in the battery but doesn't work on it no more without one I've had it for like a long time now so I guess this is like their [ __ ] new version of it um a chromed it out that's pretty dope if you see my evil labs video um go check them out they have some really weird cards I mean that there were fire is [ __ ] they were tested in like that 80% and they were like $15 of cars so I posted them probably about a month or two ago but $15 cause I'm the [ __ ] medical dispensary that's like an 80% range that's fire so go check that video out let's not back into this one now so let's open this up and by the way sorry if I sound like a little tiger in this video [ __ ] I've been working all week I will [ __ ] full-time job with you guys didn't know yeah look you haven't spoken all day to my video a little high but I'm just tired as [ __ ] but got a brand new this video is out for you not I mean so yeah she open up the package this little - becomes out music little first look that you'll see then you pop that little black rubber piece off pull your part out and here's your card guys a little first look at the car so you guys can see the consistency just like not moving at all but it is moving inside barely moving it's like a [ __ ] hourglass no I mean so yes it looks [ __ ] fire the clarity in it probably see it a little bit better than it probably see it a little bit better now it's varied he's pretty fired so we're not pretty far I mean it's his fire his [ __ ] so it's just looking for his fault Candyland expectations for this card I guess I'm pretty hard now because that blueberry cart was [ __ ] fire but it taste was not my favorite um but this Candyland I don't know that [ __ ] sounds [ __ ] fired be a candy man that [ __ ] is [ __ ] I don't know what you guys think about it like we'd rather blueberry or any time we're down below in the comments but to me candy land sounds harder we're gonna put that handle so screw listen so looks like on the pan so 500 milligrams doesn't say the potency I don't think yeah it doesn't so I'm guessing just the whole cart is flat when you Mel Abraham but you know I mean so guys are spoken along I hope you guys are smoking something dank you better be better not be spoken already to my video but now I'm just getting smoke beating you to smoke but get some bang [ __ ] but uh cheers I mean so I'm gonna put this on the lower I won't put a stone but with temperature which is green that you can only change the voltage like you can on some pins that's just the green blue and red setting the red being the hardest green being the lowest someone get a flavor test first for you guys we're gonna preheat it this is one thing I like about the pen it has like that little pre he option and like the color on the light if you see that close I don't know you call that glows yeah I guess we'd say so uh choose good all right so you can see even on like the lowest temperature this shit's blown clouds already like you see my last review that's exactly what I said my last review I I was like dry before I made that video sad I was smoking on that card kinda like all day so it was like a little bit low but in that video I said like when it's like more filled up it [ __ ] blows clouds and as you can see it [ __ ] dies so I was lying brought out the bad that he said so much more better than the blueberry one of my opinion just because it doesn't have that style remote case which is like really weird that's the first time I've ever had some wax or a part or anything that tastes like some sour milk like what the [ __ ] I don't know where they got that from but this this may seem really far it's tasted like kind of sweetie definitely I was like that sativa teas like you can tell us it's the tea before sure it's kind of sweet I don't we know we're going for another hit if you got just woken along again like I said cheers let's go take a pretty big one I couldn't I'm gonna take a little bit of a smaller hit and Nick on this next hit cuz I couldn't really get too much flavor on that took about hey obviously but on this isn't far [ __ ] like that hit my chest like like you know I mean like that bad like lung the lung expansion you get like when you think of that I've found them and they got that feeling from this and like this dizzy gives you you know what I mean so definitely a fiery part I'm gonna give this a second to pull that one then I take a little bit of a smaller hit and we'll get to the taste reading I wanna say alright so I'm sure you guys seen him that posted so many of these reviews by now but this is like your first video of mine you're watching by chance or like cart review of video if you see my selector view of the years on the back but then they say what did you say that all right there so it says a little description of how it's gonna taste and how it's supposed to make you for you and all that [ __ ] but I'd like people like this one a little description of how I would say I'll say sweet sweet earthy and I think I said something else oh yeah that's another word something like the sweet and written but yeah that's all I can only come up with but you can definitely like I said like I said Cupid taste that so I found out the pace I'll give it like the taste a lot better than a blueberry one I like this one a lot better than that one I'll give this a 4.5 out of 5 when I got four and a half out of five on that page rating so like really close to five those the evil laugh hearts brand of this [ __ ] battery I'm using those pace [ __ ] amazing those are the best tasting cars I've ever had but they're not like tested as high as these are so there's like a pro and con list you got I'm saying but uh but not besides for that this as far as [ __ ] it tastes amazing four and a half out of five it's like a really good [ __ ] reading the weight smokes let me put it on the blue light so it's like on the meeting temperature now I'm looking like a smoke test or like how well a smokes out the clouds at well of their DC but kind of blows clouds I haven't no lowest temperature nose blowing clouds for meeting temperature please go yeah that shit's [ __ ] blowing clouds um and definitely Richard trace look at that got the same before for sure my drinking but nom so the smoke the way it smokes the way close close I'm like a bit like a four out of five maybe maybe even a four and a half out of five yes somewhere in between a four and A four and a half out of five I don't know come on you guys think down below the columns actually rips and with this lighting it's kind of harder for you guys you see the smoke that's just right in my eyes but it's heart of the a I'm gonna pick up the smoke so um you guys might not see me like you guys probably can't see the cloud as well um you guys probably can't see the cloud I'm blowing out like s what was I see it but this [ __ ] clouds recipe so uh probably like a four four and a half out of five the cost though it's like 40 bucks for a half and I'm Carly I don't know if they have program towards what they do with I probably like 75 where you need plus tax so like that [ __ ] C is expensive I would rather buy one of these these are like the same price point these are [ __ ] stupid fire I have many reviews out on these if you guys haven't seen them go check them out but yeah these are seventy bucks for the ground but yeah so they cost three out of five it's they could be cheaper but I know quality hearts do cost a lot of money to make it like turkeys it's not cheap all that you know it's not she to make heart so last time saying it was the promos in cosmos but the overall score and we go to four to five expires [ __ ] but probably not gonna be my go-to card Carter never might go to to be honest waxes but yeah that's not my go-to if I wasn't good at card not besides for all that it's definitely a far apart that not my go-to car like I said like there's many other parts I would rather have that are cheaper or like just as good or better at the same price but it's definitely I already harvested I'll sleep on it tell me what you guys think of it down below in the comments definitely interested know what you guys think even though it's like my review and you guys are watching my review you know what I mean I'm always it like that yeah I always want to know what you guys think of it just because I'm interested myself I read every single

here in another cartridge review I know it's been a minute but hey better better late than never but never late is better alright so back today I got another cartridge so I hadn't been uploaded I just been busy you know but I was excited about this one I don't know why I never tried this brand I tried a lot but anyway let's get straight into it today I we're gonna come up at you with evil lab colors tropical fruit it looks bomb it smells bomb I haven't tried it but I smelled like the cartridge tasted it a little bit let's get into the details shoot its flavored tropical fruit I don't know how flavors in the taste in it but I'm more so I'm more of a strain specific dude but Abe I try whatever like as long as it's like some good stuff and evil lab out here in Colorado is known to make good cartridges all right let's get into the details you can see it says the total cannabinoids is 80% which is okay I mean it's pretty good actually THC seventy six point six seven percent and there's no CBDs in it and this is that it's called colors people lab has three different kinds one called alchemy a full spectrum 100% cannabis derived this is a hundred percent a hundred percent plant derived flavors so anyway let's just get into it man do the unboxing by the way I like I really like the packaging like so is that they really care about like their customers and they really promote their product comes in a little tube like this again all the back all the health information batch number you know all that legal stuff tech you got to do and she I mean screw this battery today I'm not the same as last video I'm still using this smoking dragon battery it rips well that's all I could say like I've tried different batteries like a Willie Nelson battery and anyway here we go here's the actual Clarke real looking nice cartridge says evil lab right at the top and like there's virtually no arable move like this is sealed all the way to the top just show you how it looks up it's a white background no runny oil so that's always a good sign if your oils runny surprise stop smoking that [ __ ] man I don't know what the hell you smoking but here we go without further ado shoot it's my first time trying it I'm excited screw this bad boy off if it has a nice little I don't know I just think it's I don't know I really like presentation go there they got me they got like a good presentation and it makes you want to buy this stuff actually thought further ado cheers guys it just hits man kind of thing it does taste food fruit punch but you also get that cannabinoid flavor I got a hot flash well it's real good man like take one more hit I really like the start I think I want to try the other three cards they have the bail range and like prices from $20 for a half gram they got $30 half grams they all range from big prices but otherwise I'm gonna get out of here I'm gonna keep I'm gonna keep poking you guys and do you guys want more reviews let me know and I'll keep I'll keep doing them yeah hi my friends", "S0MI4bH2RYc": "my bad y'all i had to stop the video real quick to give a shout out to my boy um giovanni because he um is gonna make a little banner for me for free so i had to shout him out because i can't just [ __ ] scam my boy like that's oh dude because he wasn't offering to do it for free but like i'm not that type of person so i thought at least give my boy a shout out on here like i'ma link his [ __ ] down below so if y'all want to work with him he makes um banners and [ __ ] i don't know what else he does he probably does more but if you don't want to work with him bro y'all go follow his ig i'm gonna put that [ __ ] in the description down below i'm not linking my instagram this time guys i'm just putting his [ __ ] down below for like a couple of vids just because he helped me out y'all who's good which i was going chop bro i'm here with the um review bro i got a little select you'll see it it's a little half gram it's a skittle select is wood skittles with the z and there's testing at 90 thc boys we're about to see what's good i don't have a battery i mean the charger for my bat so um i don't know if it's gonna be working good or not but if not then i'm just wait and um do the vid whenever i get a bat i just ripped off the tag i haven't done a review in the in a while boys like in a minute the last review i did was on a pre-roll i haven't done a cartridge review in a minute that's what all i would do when i first started literally all i would do but now i've been switching it up getting the story times in and other [ __ ] i can't really taste nothing because my taste isn't all there bro because i still have a little bit of the rona i think it's like mostly all the way bro because i don't feel sick no more like at all but i just can't really smell nothing or taste nothing still i could taste a little bit but only like things that taste strong you know so we're about to see this usually tastes like some light resin that's what the select cards taste like they taste exactly like raw garden if you haven't had raw garden before and this isn't even a live resin cartridge it's just a regular cartridge too oh it's got more stuff on the back that's cool manufactured on 701 packaged on 727. cbd 0.78 thc 85 hey i messed with it now let's see if the battery's working i can't taste nothing i'm guessing it tastes like live resin i'm guessing it tastes like earthy i'm guessing it has that earthy taste to it for sure so like the general just one of my favorite um cartridge rants bro because it's hard to find good cartridges bro raw garden is one of them selects one of them that's pretty much like the only good cartridges i've ever had because it's hard for me to find good cards bro i want to try moon rocks i want to try um i want to try the um papas and herb carts i don't know if you have seen those those are pretty dang those look pretty dang they're like nine dollars a half gram bro but the place be selling like 35 and a half damn this battery is still ripping even though um what's it called this is what it's looking like boys this battery is still ripping even though um i haven't charged this [ __ ] in forever bro ca stamp select half gram you know some fire let me know if you have ever had select if so which strain did you have and if not what is your favorite cart brand like just carts what's your favorite brand bro and what's your favorite strain within that brand my favorite one is probably like select i don't know what strain though because i haven't had all the strains so like that rock garden i mean but raw guard is like it smacks a little harder i'm not gonna lie it smacks a little harder but they have the exact same type of taste you know what i'm saying like that live resin tastes if you guys have light resin before you guys know what i'm talking about i'm gonna take one more hit and i'm gonna i think that's the end of this little review right

farms and we have some trinkets that you can smoke we here my man my somebody we live in a time right now we're portable vaporizers are in everybody's pocket why not add some style add some fashion add some class to it for every product that we sell we donate a meal to one of seven food banks in California Nevada well we've donated about 1.2 million meals over the past few years really we just try to bring awareness to it so that you can make it positive impact and I'm think you guys are doing a great job you know you got some of this for the host of the show a couple of these to take with me couple of these and y'all are doing good this year I'll tell you the truth the first one right here this is our high THC version we call this highlighter Plus this is about a 80% or more THC right next to it is our rose gold highlighter that's pretty it's pretty right yeah it's beautiful it's a it's a one-to-one CBD to THC ratio and then on the right side here we've got our highlighter uncrate special edition we only made a few thousand of these things a nice matte soft touch finish it's also a one-to-one CBD THC ratio [Music] that's clean give me some pricing so these are right around $100 a piece well I guess the show is the most expensive it's right sighs I'll pull up here how many how many how many pumps in this thing uh well it depends on how big a puffy take yeah so this is the most expensive is tech break and this would actually be smart the great way to check", "SsC4jaIY8sQ": "[Music] welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and I've got my trusty pour one out 510 vape battery that is finely [ __ ] the bet on me after 15 cartridge reviews or something it finally [ __ ] the bed and my trusty 510 battery has died so I'm pulling out the backup the cheaper chintzy er one here that's okay we'll get a new one we'll get a better one but I'm gonna miss my old friend there has died but outside of the funeral for our trusty 510 vape pen we are here for a joyous celebration and we are here to review the product that I have had to me suggested the most of anything I have ever reviewed or intended to review and that is brass knuckles we are finally reviewing brass knuckles I have had you guys a lot of you recommending me check out brass knuckles check out brass knuckles check out brass knuckles and I've used brass knuckles in the past and but we won't talk about that but today we are going to be reviewing brass knuckles finally found some here in Long Beach and I'm very very excited to give it a review so this is the one gram Gorilla Glue cartridge and it comes in some a primo packaging that I have no doubt I'm gonna have difficulty opening here really nice packaging as you can see plastic on the outside it's got all the information you want on the inside lab tested contaminant and pesticide free that brings me up to the controversy I I know that there was a big controversy with brass knuckles for a while about pesticide usage but apparently that is no longer the case I hope that is no longer the case I I would a vet suggest you do your due diligence and research if you're really worried about those kind of things what you might probably should be maybe so do your own due diligence make sure you know this is something for you but from what I've heard they have all of their problems in terms of having pesticides or whatever fungicides or whatever I was that was in there it's no longer the case so Gorilla Glue is my favorite strain as I have said many a times I have seen it listed as both hybrid and indica this is a hybrid gorilla glue I like it both as hybrid and indica this cost me as you can see $52 at my dispensary which is a bit of a miss which is a bit misleading because really with the 35% taxes it can cost considerably more than that but $52 is the base price so you know pretty expensive but not outrageously more expensive than other cartridges this one just has the reputation sort of throughout Southern California as being the best of the best and I think I actually got it open without too much trouble there maybe here we go here's our cartridge in its little packaging there for medicinal use only not for redistribution and we can see their weed maps all that logos blah blah blah blah blah they have a snapchat how fun alright we have got our standard 510 pen here not our former best friend bottoms cap just like all the others with these little rubber stoppers whoever makes these little rubber stoppers must be doing pretty bonk owes business right now I would imagine let's screw this in ooh I like the color of this oil nice dark golden oil beautiful looking oil there a nice brass tip I guess that's where the name brass knuckles come from and a nice wide intake hole there so very excited to give this a drop let's give it a go oh wow that is a premium experience that is a smooth with smooth draw Wow ignore the cough that's my fault not theirs I'm a coffer this does not burn hot at all you can barely feel it entering along it's wonderful the taste is exquisite and Wow I'm already feeling pretty nicely medicated actually oh wow they use a bad word on their packaging here I'm gonna have to read that for you guys I don't see what their THC potency is listed at on here but I do know that they are among the highest in the state I think I've seen before that it's over 90% it certainly feels that way I'm already feeling quite high after just 3 3 little puffs there one negative thing and it might actually be this pen is I'm not getting this huge a draw as I would want for pulling I like the bigger clouds but it's sort of ameliorated by the fact that even the small draws are getting me quite high and it might actually just be this pen doesn't have the voltage to get the huge clouds I'll double check I'm gonna be getting a new pen before I finish this so I'll I'll be sure to let you guys know in the follow up if that still the case Wow but up into this point brass knuckles definitely definitely earns their reputation tastes great hits like a dream oh man really really really enjoying the brass on my brass knuckles experience here guys if only it were a little easier to draw from it would be perfect but again that maybe the pen and I'll be sure to let you know guys because I'm gonna review this entire cartridge I'm not just gonna take a couple of puffs and say it's good I'm gonna come back to you guys after I finish this whole Graham here to let you know exactly my thoughts let you know if anything's changed if the starting to leak if the oil got tacky whatever the case may be I'll be sure to let you know in the follow up so I'll come back to you guys probably in four or five days after I finished this bad boy off and let you know exactly what I'm thinking thank you so much for watching weeks to this point guys and I will see you in just a bit it has been actually I believe eight days since I last checked in with you talking the one gram brass knuckles Gorilla Glue cartridge so right off the bat I wasn't doing this really any less than any other cartridge I don't feel like but it lasted a long long time I really got your values worth with this one certainly a gram in there the other thing is it is still very potent this is a potent a blend that they've got in here this is certainly as strong as its sort of reputation lends it to believe but all that being said my initial I'm not as emphatically as in love as I was with my initial impressions or as I was when I gave my initial impressions there have been a couple of things that have walnut spoiled me on the experience have certainly damper the experience one is it became significantly more difficult to draw as time went on I did get a new battery to test it with and even with a new battery it was still kind of tough to draw from and it got harder and harder as time went on and which is something I really have a problem with with the VBA I much prefer the ones that have nice easy drawers that you can make nice big you know take nice big inhalations with as the kids call them make nice big clouds this wasn't really that and I'm not sure if it was this cartridge in particular as you can see there's actually some oil left there at the bottom I just had such a tough time drawing from it that I think I'm just gonna have to leave it there the other thing is it did start to get a bit of a burnt taste as I got closer to the bottom the closer I got the more burnt the taste was it for the most part tasted great I really enjoyed the taste but as we started to get near the end or trim it's the end of its life that burnt taste started to amplify so tough to draw from and increasingly tough to draw from and an increasingly unpleasant taste those aren't good things for sure those those weren't those theirs don't keep it and there's hold it back and getting in my highest remarks for sure but I feel like I'm definitely gonna get brass knuckles the second chance I've heard enough about them that I'm wondering if maybe I just got a bad card what the case may be so I'm gonna give him a second chance we're gonna review something else from them in the future but for now between the two because they're so often compared and they're so look alike I actually think I might prefer the heavy hitters to brass knuckles maybe yeah I think in my initial impressions I would go with the heavy hitter of the brass knuckle but let's get let's go ahead and do another brass knuckle review before we give it any the definitive conclusion and overall my impressions are still pretty positive this is a potent a long lasting cartridge that you're gonna get your money's worth from so you know I it's still really positive review it's just not as good as I initially had hoped but we will be examining them and given the future so fingers crossed and that guys is gonna do it for this review but before I bounce I want to share with you a little cherry on top just something I can share with you guys that isn't necessarily weed related but could be enjoyed with weed or with or without weed and so on this cherry on top what I wanted to share with you guys was something nice and simple something nice and easy an 11 minute web clip from the fine folks at where I guess fine folks the mostly male folks over at Adult Swim make Krueger's of creators of chosen Rick and Morty or at least the hosts of such shows as Rick and Morty but that's not we're here to talk about is Rick and Morty we are here to talk about their 11 minutes short too many cooks too many cooks too many cooks it is an 11 minute video and if you haven't seen it a lot of you I'm sure have that sort of tries to replicate many 90s opening credit songs but things go awry and that's about all I want to say because you should know as little about it as possible before going in because it is who it's gonna be one of the most surreal 11 minutes of your life Definitely Maybe recommend if you do have some cannabis on hand doing some before hand if you're not prone to paranoia if you are definitely pass on it but it's gonna be enjoyable I think for you guys again that is called too many cooks on Adult Swim I'm sure you can find it on YouTube just search too many cooks so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on wheat sand that's gonna do it for this cherry on top as well thank you so much for sticking around to the very end here guys I appreciate it as always and we will see you on the next review peace", "088VoPXFNaY": "i don't know why i want to sing every other day every other day every other day is fine [Music] happy hour so this is going to be a review and then also some notes i took from dr vessel van kalk hey if there's a living dude alive that i would like to hang out with it's you dr russell you just get it like i was cool stop i was like crying last night just like releasing trauma but also because he's so on point he wrote a book called um i really want to get it it's called the body keeps the score okay but first i'm gonna put this in this friend one really interesting thing look at my neck sit down with what look at your neck okay so you know a lot of people have muscles here that you'll see when you when you turn you can see mine like that part and moi so let me sit normal so you can see i'm missing them they're absent those are called the curiosity muscles see and traumatized people don't have time to have them like you can literally tell people that are traumatized or not traumatized if they have this part of the muscle sticking out it made a lot of sense to me because we're like this all the time like unconsciously a huge thing he said whether i've heard this before or not and that's the thing about healing like [ __ ] will hit i don't want to sound like you know woke [ __ ] will hit different he's like and maybe it's just because i've had an ex had experience with people who don't understand and i'm learning it as i'm healing so i don't totally understand but for anybody that's that loves somebody that has trauma or has been through trauma and has somebody that they trust and love to explain this is the easiest freaking way it's vessel van cock's way of explaining that people don't understand trauma is not a story that happened to someone that's not trauma isn't memories i have it's not stories it's a rewiring of the brain so i've made that joke like trauma brain before because i read that in a book somewhere basically i love him i want to marry him you guys um he did the first study on uh yoga and trauma and found that trauma was more the most successful john was the most successful at healing yoga yoga is more successful than any medicine at healing yoga um where are my notes though my proper ones the rewiring of the limbic system um you said something funny it's like traumatized people aren't like usually very popular people because they're awkward and we are awkward i guess and i was thinking about like how lucky i am to have like at least a few people that i know love me even though i'm so quirky and awkward but um yeah i'll always be standing here strong for anybody that's not strong enough yet because i remember that okay okay um i mean i remember what it felt like to be completely alone and it wasn't the world's not fair toss that you know like forget the world being fair there's just like there's a lot of grace to be had for giving people that are not sorry and also continue to orchestrate duress in your life okay so one big thing okay so the difference between trauma being a story like this that happened to somebody like somebody that had been through trauma might i could i guess i could understand this when he was saying it last night why do they keep talking about that story like if somebody i would imagine like and i did see this actually i did see this actually in some way that i was seeing after like somebody that i was dating after my father passed away he hadn't experienced really any loss like his parents or anything and like i could tell like at some point it's like just get over it your dad died you know what i mean like and like depending on the relationship you have with your parents um i mean for me that was the one i always knew my whole life it would be the event that would knock me down that i would not survive and i still have a daily relationship with the fact that it has not here but just to like even have those feelings i think is i don't know i think it just makes people different like i remember i dated a guy in high school and his mother passed away like before we were together like his mom passed away when he was eight and we were like in high school we did it all through high school and he used to cry about his mom i'm like i had both my parents they were freaking happy healthy like very amazing but like i remember like it would scare the crap out of me and like i would go and be like that i love you you know but i guess everyone's different for a person that's experienced trauma that changed their brain it's not just a story that they're repeating it's physiological responses that they're basically um of it's um your being state is constantly compromise and then at the whim of like for example i made a video the other day my dog jumped out of the bed funny and like hit my elbow and like my body that's why i love the title of this guy's book the body keeps the score my body like shot into i was like hyperventilating and crying and like i was in some kind of trauma that had been triggered by telling my body remember but my mind was successful in in shoving away so it's a huge huge milestone um marker of like badassery for healing to be able to say that this happened to me and it was bad but today is march 24th it's over i can actually do that um body keeps the score mindfulness uh rewiring the brain resetting the limbic system and trauma therapy so like the curiosity muscle like people trauma don't have time to be curious we also put to the brain are shut off like the parts for creativity for imagination so it's very important for us to be in safe places where we can be creative and imaginative yeah curiosity muscle is uh absent in traumatized people ah okay so every other day um this is called everyday mimosa one gram for use with 510 thread only okay so this is one i've not tried before i skew that part down wah everyday it's an indica look how bossy it is on the back five ten thread only okay i'm gonna get my egg rolls before they burn i'm wondering it's a sativa i thought it was an indica it's a sativa i'm wondering where they're going to give me the info on the thc hey boys these are the boys that brunch juventus poised up brunch on sundays too yeah i told them about that okay so it comes in this cute little thing [Applause] okay show no info on the ttc content i guess it's just gonna be a surprise so everyone knows 510 thread it's like silly did you even fire he needs to get to the bathroom it's like a silly thing because it wouldn't fit in anything else so it's like 5 10 10 only like not say thank you for buying my product it's i i'm just kidding let's see oh there's the information 89 thc 10 milligrams of cbd i'm liking that package 127. sorry 1 15 21. two days that's my mom's birthday kinder understanding sensitive healing i like the whole medical genre but you could say something like nice like this little area is like i don't know why not put hearts instead bye it's good it's nice", "erXpR_x6YzI": "what's up YouTube it's your boy mr. bling seed back again with another video today I'm coming at you with an unofficial dank vapes comparison and review the carts I have in question are pineapple express an ace of spades OOP I move the pineapple Express so the reason I'm making this video is because I know that dank vapes carts are all illegitimate but there are still some that are better than others and some that are more healthy for you to smoke are at least more safe for you to smoke than others um and if these are all you have like availability for it then you should at least know which ones you should buy and which ones you should just stay away from altogether because that way you don't waste your money and you're also at least being an informed consumer and you're staying relatively safe so today we have two different cards as you can see the packaging is also different the strains are different but they're both say tank faiths which is wild and you can see like if you look more closely there is a lot of difference in these cart packages you have this one which shows the card from this side it says 1.1 grams and DANC on the side it has raised sort of like background art I guess I could call that and a holographic dang face logo on the top the front the bottom and the side except this side on this side it says dang clips official account all organic no propylene glycol and on the back it says Ace of Spades is a creation from TGA sub cool seeds that takes advantage of the popular sweet and sour combination that never goes out of style a crossbreed of black cherry soda and Jack the Ripper this strain has an earthy berry and citrus smell that carries over into the taste with distinctly lemony flavours Asus blades pants ace of spades plants grow fast and need a lot of space because they will get both bushy and tall flowering occurs at eight weeks and they are generally large and heavy see the funny thing about Danks vapes is that on the back of all of their carts they just have the leaf Lee articles written right there which I mean I don't hate because it's easy for reviews because I can just read the back of the packaging but like it's also kind of lazy what do you think about it anyway so the Apple Express card we have raised letters but flat background art we have irregular art on the front and Danks waves on the front you can't see the cart from the side but it still says dang faves official account all organic no propylene glycol on this side it says the same thing and it has a holographic tank on the top and bottom the description for pineapple Express after I drop the cart and focus pineapple express combines the potent and flavorful forces of parent strange trainwreck and Hawaiian the smell is like into fresh apple and mango with a taste of pineapple pine and cedar this hard-hitting sativa dominant hybrid provides a long-lasting energetic buzz perfect for productive afternoons and creative escapes so there is the packaging review of these cards now the question is which one is real and which one is fake so after doing a bit of research online you can find that there pretty much four major ways to see whether your dank babes carts are real or fake and that would be looking at the packaging itself which I just showed you guys but now I'll go more into detail with that the Instagram account that's on the side of the packaging the C cell atomizer itself and the wax quality so I'm gonna go over each of these cards one by one and just show you like the different points to look at and then uh I'll go ahead and review them and show you guys how they both hit and I'll give you my opinion on which one tastes better so after doing a bit of research online you find that they're pretty much four major ways to check whether or not you have a legit sort of official tank vapes cart versus a knockoff that your dealer just kind of put some snake oil in the four major ways would be looking at the packaging itself the Instagram account on the side the there are signs on the bottom of these C cell atomizers that'll tell you and a wax quality so in this review I'm gonna be going over each of those four points with each of these carts and showing you which ones are more trustworthy and which ones aren't but then I'm also going to be hitting both of them to show you guys the wax quality and I'll tell you how the hits feel if they're chemically and burn or if they're like sort of smooth and tastes good um and then finally I'll tell you guys about the highs based off each of them so yeah let's get into this review I'm actually pretty excited for starting this recording I did do some like light sort of examinations of these karts to see which ones I thought were real and fake before starting the video and I'll just tell you that right now I'm pretty sure this one is legitimate banks vapes carts and this one is not so let me show you why I think this so according to my research and I'll link all my sources in the description below but first off it says that the dank vapes packaging that is legit has the cart shown on the side and that's kind of funny to me because I've had a dank faves carts like this before which was the strawberry shortcake one and it had the same packaging pretty much exactly except a sort of like red theme because it was obviously strawberry shortcake and that being said I've also had carts that are like the pineapple Express ones I'm going to this more in a little bit let's go back to the Ace of Spades anyway so online it says that legitimate dank babes carts have raised lettering for the stream but like lowered lettering for the actual date vapes logo and the back art should be raised and that the theme of these carts are basically all black secondly on the side it should say dank vapes official account because that is the only actual dank vapes official Instagram account that exists some fake carts will just say like dank vapes official or like dank vapes account but if it doesn't say if it does say tanks beeps official account then usually it should be a more legitimate current than others I say that because as you can see on the pineapple Express it also has the right thing so next up if you open the packaging and you take out the cart first you can look at the wax quality and see that uh this one is a bit runny it's not slow it's sort of uh the air bubble transfer is really fast in superfast which is not really a good sign for wax quality so I would definitely watch out for that oh when I actually hit it I'll be able to tell you more about if the wax like is good but for now I'm not very like excited to try this cart um if you look at the bottom let me see if I can get that to focus okay yeah so you see this K you see a stamp number and you see C so though that shows that this is an official C cell cartridge or atomizer at least zoom out there we go looking beautiful um so yeah as you can see this is a real C cell atomizer with some lower quality wax in it which is kind of funny to me because well I go through the process of like getting the best packaging getting good like atomizers and then putting late some kind of crappy oil in it obviously I'm saying it's crappy just based off of these like visual tests but when I actually get into like tasting it maybe I'll be wrong who knows umm another fun thing that I did look into or my old C cell cart or atomizers so we have this one from the serial curtain they see that this is a real C cell cartridge as the C sell the CA and decay on it if it's a fake it could still have all of these but the font will be um kind of stretched out and big and not like actually etched in to the cart like it is with these um on this traphouse Curt atomizer that's supposed to also be a C so you can see that it doesn't have C cell on it it has like another brand so this would be one of those knockoff sort of atomizers that are sold from China and that's on this trap house card so a lot of companies have been using DC cell cars because they do hit nice and they give you good flavor but some still use legitimate C cells and some also still use like knockoffs so this is the ace of spades one final look before I go on to the pineapple Express and I'll be right back alright so with this pineapple Express cart you can see that you can look at the wax itself and the atomizer from the front of the packaging which if you look online and will say that this would be second-generation tank vapes packaging which I'm not really sure how like believable that is but I mean everything else on the packaging checks out the Leafly description on the back it's got raised lettering on the front and not a raised deck vapes logo but those dang capes logo is still holographic and gold um it's got raised artwork it has the actual like tank vapes account on it and the packaging just feels like it feels quality and premium which i know sounds weird but like if you're getting a fake packaging you can sort of feel that the Pat the paper would be like kind of shitty and not like good quality and thick like this is let's go ahead and open up the packaging and look at the sea salt cartridge itself now looking at the sea solid cellphone this is what leads me to believe that it's a fake because as you can see it checks out it looks fine um the bar in the middle is not thick on some fakes that bar will be hella thick but uh when you look at the bottom of it its it will focus it's a sea cell but it says M 208 when you look up see sell em 208 on google it'll bring up the Jupiter Cecil atomizers and in case you didn't know Cecil also owns Jupiter so like the liquid 610 or batteries and any of the lake Jupiter atomizers are also legitimate Cecil atomizers except for the fact that Cecil atomizers always have to have three prints on the bottom it'll have either Jupiter or that little K C cell and then a a lot number or a serial number this only has two so it can't be an actual C cell cartridge so it's a fake atomizer bought from China but if you look at the wax quality you can see that it's sort of good the bubble is small and it's moving very very slowly so this needs me to believe that the lacked quality itself is either very good or it's mixed with something very thick to make move slower which is why you have to like look at all these sort of uh signs that I'm trying to show you guys versus just like one or two of them so what I'm gonna go ahead and do is throw these cards onto my C cell m3 battery and I'll just show you guys how they hit um just so you can see a bit of like the wax quality and like the clouds you can get but I'm not gonna do a full review until tomorrow because I'd like to have a day with them to actually be able to test the wax quality and the highs because when I'm doing a video on something that could be like like health risks I'd like to at least give you guys a real review that's comprehensive so I think having a day to test like if the wax gives me a headache or if it makes me feel sick or if it just burns and tastes bad like I can tell you that better based off like a full day of using these than just um like a little five-minute review so let me go ahead and take these first hits and then we shall see tomorrow what my final verdict on these cards is I got a new sort of filming spot for now because it's summer and oh my god it is [ __ ] hot as hell in this house anyway so we're gonna be taking our first hits off of these dang babes carts what I'm probably gonna do is I think I'm gonna hit the Pineapple Express one first than the ace of spades second because while I think the Pineapple Express could be a fake I really want to test out this max quality more than anything because really that's what matters when you're buying these carts too is wax quality so let's go ahead and screw it on with the C cell I'm three let's just take a rip cheers guys so as you can see that's a pretty nice cloud I think especially for like a first hit off of a cart that's not even like preheated yet so let me take another hit and then I'll talk about the taste and like how it feels but so far I'm having positive opinions on this it tastes really good it actually tastes like like a bit of mango and pineapple so I'm already becoming a fan of this pineapple Express cart I'm gonna hit it one more time and then I'll go ahead and switch over to ASA spades Cheers yeah yeah I'm definitely a fan of this right now plus as you can see like I'm not coughing right now and if you watch any of my other videos you'll see like Ike off like a [ __ ] with baby lungs so positive opinion on pineapple express tank vapes let's go ahead and check this Ace of Spades over the next we're gonna hit this ace of spades card let's see how that goes okay packaging go ahead and screw it onto the seesaw 11 3 let's take our first rib Cheers okay so it tastes kind of bad and like I don't even think that was a very good cloud from it so let's try again I'm not sure how familiar you are with Indian food but this current sort of tastes like cardamom which is a very big seasoning in Indian food and I'm not a fan of it um it also just kind of burns the back of my throat when I'm hitting it so I'm not really feeling too confident about this an ace of spades card from dang babes let me hit it one more time and see if my opinion can change yeah it is really spicy not spicy but it just really tastes like cardamon and I was expressing a sort of like sour sweet taste so I'm kind of disappointed but either way I don't think it'd be a true mr. blinky review if I didn't hit these cards out of the dab cap just to test them out even further so I got the daily high club piece from a a blue dab cap in this cart let's just hit both of them through the dab cap for today I'll see how they feel then tomorrow I'll come back at you with like a full review so Cheers on the Ace of Spades so late even ripping it out of it to have cab it took forever in a cloud of the piece and then it still just didn't even taste good so hazel speeds right now I definitely have a negative opinion of it it could change you to eat today and tomorrow but for now I really think this pineapple Express is gonna be the better card let me go and load it up and then I'll take it through the top cap and they will end for you today all right so we got the pineapple Express on the dab cap let's go ahead and hit it through this piece and then I'll catch you guys tomorrow Cheers okay so I cut out the coffee but they ain't very nice you could see the cloud it was very uh thick and dense and it tasted amazing it made me coffee lot that was because I think it was just a really good hit so i'ma go ahead and review these carts in like my personal use and then tomorrow come back and tell you guys like which one is better or not I can tell you right now though I am fried as hell so one of these carts are maybe even both of them who knows they definitely work so yeah I'll see you guys in the next day I've been vaping on to ace of spades which is this current and the Pineapple Express since yesterday evening and I think I have an actual good review for each of them so my ace of spades review would be that the atomizer itself doesn't nearly hit as hard as the Pineapple Express won which in retrospect isn't necessarily a bad thing because it means this wax will last longer then the pineapple Express wax but it'll also take you considerably longer to get high initially when you're trying to smoke in um the high on it lasts three and a half to five hours which was really cool and the way I can describe the high for me at least was that it made me feel kind of tired but relaxed enough and like it also helped me focus enough that I could edit like this video as well as do some studying so that was really cool I really like that so I'm a fan of the high for that the negatives of it would be that it did make me feel a bit paranoid which I'm not a fan of because like just having like general anxiety this cart made that a bit worse so I would definitely only smoke this car at night and if I'm trying to actually like either just go to sleep or maybe get something done at night other than that I would not smoke this during the day simply because it would make me paranoid and it just doesn't seem worth it especially when the Pineapple Express makes me feel pretty like energetic imma go into it more in a second but like my overall review of the Ace of Spades would probably be a 6 out of 10 it would get a 7 if the atomizer hit a little bit better and if it didn't make me paranoid but uh I would recommend these dang babes carts pretty much only if you don't have any other choices or if your other choices are like exotic carts or Mario karts cuz these are at least a bit better than those but they're not like amazing so yeah that was the a subspace I'm gonna take another hit as the final review hit of this cart so cheers guys hope you're vaping along or smoking something let's get it so ya didn't cough so that's nice it's a nice smooth hit this is a fully charged C cell m3 so yeah Ace of Spades six out of ten would recommend only as an alternative for like worst cards now let's get to this pineapple Express find out will Express if you guys can remember is the fake cart which is funny to me because it's my first cart out of the two um the wax is definitely thicker and it hits better than the ace of spades cart but like I said the ace of spades cart is definitely gonna last a lot longer than this one um the high off of this cart makes me feel a bit energetic helpfully focus on my tasks and one of my favorite things is that it makes music sound a lot better and more clear which I'm always a fan of when I'm smoking because I love listening to music um well I was a high off this drain I went on a walk I cooked dinner and I cleaned my room so definitely a very very like good day stream especially if you have some stuff to get done I'm about to edit or finish editing this video on this high so I'm very excited for that which is funny to say because like editing is boring but uh now this card makes everything feel a bit more like interesting and definitely just helps me focus better um a negative of this cart would be that I sort of felt maybe a little bit aggressive at like when I was coming down from the high so I'm not really a fan of that but other than that it's pretty much all positives this car I would give like an 8 out of 10 it's better than a lot of other like brands that I've had like chrono Polly is not as good as damn boots but it's uh it's as good as most of the other dang babes I've had so it's funny to say but I kind of almost prefer this little fake packaging on the pineapple Express card just so y'all can see it hopefully it's in frame like this is packaging that you can buy generically but the wax ended up being better quality than the real dang vapes so I guess what I would do if I were you guys would really be to just test that wax quality by like flipping it because it seems to me like that is what is like the biggest indicator of if your wax is gonna be good quality versus like if it's an actual see saw cartridge looking at the packaging really all you got to look at is wax quality because all of these cards are fake although they're not fake but like all of them are illegitimate and they all have the pesticides in the loop so at this point you just gotta like choose which is the biggest bang for your buck and the biggest like risk you want to take and I really don't think this is bad quality wax like it tastes fine to me and it doesn't really hurt let's just take a hit so I can show you guys it takes so amazing I really can't express that enough but uh yeah so eight out of ten would HIGHLY highly recommend the pineapple express if you ever come across it um make sure to stay informed and try to stay safe guys cuz like this [ __ ] black market card business it's kind of wild I'm learning more about it everyday and I'm just gonna keep like showing you guys what I learned I hope you enjoyed the video welcome to the channel if you made it this far please subscribe and like and I'll catch y'all later stay warm lacet Cheers", "VthK8TnAf3s": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] your was popping is your boy mr. THC man I'm back at it with the banger now look you guys this is gonna be part of my cheapest versus most expensive series where I go to different dispensaries and I try out different products right so last time I tried out flower I got the cheapest eighth and the most expensive eight in Washington State today I'm in Las Vegas so I visited planet 13 which by the way if you're in Vegas and you have to choose between reef and planet 13 I highly recommend you go to Planet 13 I felt like it was a way better dispensary they had a lot more options it was a lot more open and you were able to really move around and look at everything they had I went down there and this time I decided that we're gonna be reviewing their cheapest versus the most expensive cartridge now before I show you the product I just want to give him an understanding of how much everything came up to okay so for the half gram the most expensive half gram it was priced at $100 before tax right now I bought let me see how many items you got we got one two three four or five how about five items here that I bought and it was $55 in taxes so let's just give it you know let's just say that every item had $10 tax to it right just the same so that means that that $100 half gram is now 110 dollars because of the tax not to mention that this half gram didn't come with the battery so I had to buy a 15 dollar battery now the fifteen dollar battery doesn't really have a ten dollar tax to it but just because I'm dividing up the total tax that I was charged for everything that I purchased I just thought that I would throw it in there and had another $10 to the battery to substitute for the tax so now we're at a twenty five dollar battery and that a hundred and ten dollar and a half gram so that puts us at a hundred and thirty five dollars in total tax included battery included cartridge included with a half gram which is really pricey if you ask me and for the cheapest cartridge it was fifty five dollars which was a disposable cart which means that he already came with the ability for you to use it you didn't have to buy the battery on this I was fifty five dollars but now adding the $10.00 tax that I might need to all the items it was about it $65 cartridge right there now this is pretty expensive this is a Las Vegas prices I know Cali would have been wait jeepers like never in my life have I paid over $100 or even a $100 bro for a half gram of distillate like what the hell because I'm pretty sure this is just a little right I don't think it doesn't say anything about like live resin oh it is live resin my bad so not for distillate its life resin but still man this is an expensive cartridge right here you guys so this is what the expensive one looks like right here it comes in this fancy box which I'll give it to them I mean at least they you know they message some of that money that they're charging for this product into the way that the box looks now I'm gonna break down for you guys the whole entire like THC percentage etc etc you know what I'm saying so so the THC percentage test at eighty two point 61% CBD is zero there's no that there's no CBD and there there's cbn 11.1 total terpene so the terpenes is actually like the flavor profile to your product right it's gonna determine how the product tastes and all these flavors and aromas also play a role into how the high hits you so the terpenes are actually really really important this has an eight point zero five percent terpene base which is really hot especially for a live resin so this is supposed to be really gas that's actually what you're paying for when you're buying this product you're paying to get more trips to get more flavor and more quality out of your high and since it's life present it's gonna give you a way better higher than the distillate I personally hate hitting distillate man like when I first started I just I didn't know any better so that's just what I would do but after trying like the life resident I was just like all bro you can't go back to just regular distillate now look I'm gonna open it up and show you guys what it looks like when you open it a little box in here you see that boom Wow what look at that you guys it's like sick now they have their logo right in the front it's crazy because the guy at the shop was like just smell it smell it oh my god it smells so good it just smells like strong strong concentrate now if we look at the back of the box once it opens up that's how it opens this is what the inside of the package looks like so they're talking about the philosophy provide only world-class cannabis products for customers our state-of-the-art production process utilizes THC distillate and cannabis derived terpenes coupled with premium hardware is simply unmatched this technology consistently delivers an unparalleled vaping experience where elegance meets perfection hmm okay so again 110 dollars right here after tax 15 dollars but since we divided the text evenly do all the five items that I purchased we're gonna add another ten dollars to it and just say that it was a 25 dollar battery after tax 135 dollars right here now I was told that this battery was already gonna be charged and ready to go I believe this is Planet Thirteen's like the branded batteries that they have there we're just gonna go ahead put this on here and take off this top rubber piece now before I go ahead and try this project I'm actually gonna open up the other product that we got and talk about the cheapest wax battery that we got so this is roots I got the cush mango and this one I have a believe all the testing for it I got all the testing right here so mango Kush oh you know what I'm so sorry on the last one oh I did tell you guys the TC percentage tripping I'm high you guys I'm already late alright so for the mango push this one tested really high in THC percentage so THC tested at ninety one point ninety seven percent again this is the cheap one this is the $55 sixty five dollar after tax cartridge right here okay um let me see CBG which I really don't know exactly what that cannabinoid is and test that twenty four point forty nine milligrams look at the terpene percentage though the terpene percentage is at one point zero three so basically this one has eight times the terpene profile than this one so this should make for a way more better quality experience and high but this was more convenient you know this one is just you open up the package right pure and simple you got everything right here in the back okay now when you open up the package this side right here is empty I don't know why but everything is on this side so you can just like use your finger to you know slide bad boy out there oh now it comes like this right you just pop this open and you're ready to go wow that feels good at the finger okay is this what is this what is this okay so roots this is I know these are disposable but why is this like this I don't think that you guys is logo this is basically their local you guys look look at this I don't think you guys just logo should be able to come off that easy I mean I'm pretty sure it wasn't meant to happen like that I'm gonna just put it back for sure it's meant to look like this but first impression mm-hmm you know but yeah guys here you have it to my left side we have planet 13s cheapest babe cartridge that's disposable so you'd have to worry about buying a battery and to my right side their most expensive premium $100 bro 110 after-tax 135 after we add everything up with the battery 65 over here on the Left what do you guys think would you spend over $100 on a oh you guys say [ __ ] that I'm spending $65 after tax out the door and now I don't got to worry about the battery I'm just don't listing away what I'm doing I don't know hey guys we're gonna have to taste them and really see how we feel about them we're gonna go ahead and start off with the roots all right let's go ahead and give this thing a shot now we're gonna try to complain I really want a good to flower look we're gonna do a blinker out of them and if we're gonna do like you know shorter pause and we'll do longer pulls we're kind of play with it a little bit to try to actually get the flavor flavor you know put it down for a second I was like what does it think don't blink Wow dude the room just got foggy my eyes bro my soul left my body okay that was strong that 91 percent THC dude it's different however though it reminded me of like when you hit a dirty Punk no offense I'm not trying to talk [ __ ] you know what I'm saying because wasn't that bad okay hitting a dirty bomb it's a lot worse but I still reminded me of just like when you take one of those rips that just leaves your throat oh you know tasting all nasty and [ __ ] I think that I got really hot too like the disposable battery it took a really long pull so I kept I was feeling like the mouthpiece getting hotter and hotter so maybe it was a little too hot for the product so now we're gonna try small pools medium pools and longer pools to get the flavor out of those but I need to get some water bro god damn alright so there's been a solid ten minutes right off the bad guys the flavors wasn't there dude like I'm sorry you guys can improve on the flavor you know what I didn't write this thing just to lit oh this is hash oil posh this side of that let me see and this is the mango cush I believe is what this train is called the other strain cold it's called medicine Chloe I believe is with this one here is called a hundred percent pure cannabis oil no additives no fillers no synthetic terpenes okay so maybe that's why it has that flavor because it doesn't have faked our booth actually it's obviously pretty good cuz fake Terps or [ __ ] you know you don't want a bunch of fake Terps like dis lis it's just a bunch of fake chirps but it says it's hash oil I don't know is that like I really don't know all right but this is its hat it's premium hash oil so the other one is like resin let's take a short poll and see I'm saying a couple straw polls and just see how like it tastes and stuff yeah I mean now that I hit it more the flavor isn't really what's off-putting I think it's more like it's just a very dry throat it tries to throw up quick we take like a medium part of it man but you know what gets you so bad bro I started to explain something to my go downstairs and now saying all kinds of things well always like do so look the highest am i high is no joke this is not this isn't for rookies right here bro still knock that ass out you know you guys $65 brothers a good bang for your buck for real now I want to take like a longer pool just to see at what point I feel like it's you know it's too much or it just makes your throat too dry or whatever yes definitely with like the bigger pools that it leaves like that burn and your throw afterwards you know maybe it's just like the temperature because I'm just something that longer you're hitting it the harder it's getting because it's just on and more consistent you know but median to small hits on this thing is to go to to enjoy and if you're just trying to get like super medicated I guess like you know a long a long rip will do it for you oh I am eight to 10 out of 10 I'm out of 10 for real and I was the cheapest one now we got you guys the medicine Chloe and the medicine is spelled like M EDI Zi it's full of fun easy all right I guess we gotta turn it off with the blinker just like we do the other one so cheers you guys Wow there's some of the cleanest I've ever tried I'm hurt I'm hurt I swear by the end of this video I'm being so sleepy hi guys so the flavor was phenomenal it's like when I coughed it didn't burn my throat so I kind of like thought it was like what what my throat didn't burn it tastes crazy I don't even know how to explain the taste it tastes like when you hit a really really clean joint with some good flour you know and you just hit it and you just tasting the flour me like damn this flowers clean and the flavors on point that was crazy yo what the hell damn I'm up to highs on for myself don't be like here babe you have this one it's kidding all right let's take a small rip a medium rip and then a long rip I'm really excited for the small ring because it tastes so good Wow you know it's crazy and I don't know why this is what it tastes like to me but it tastes like a lemon raspado which is like just Google that little hemming dress bad I'll put a picture you you know what I mean that's what it tastes like it is delicious who this TT is crazy I don't know I mean this is more for like the premium smokers you know I guess this is more for like the people that are like I need quality every single Hey which I understand yo cuz even though the THC percentage is lower you're still gonna get just as bait you just gotta hit it maybe a little bit more but every hit can it be more enjoyable so it comes out to like some people might rather be like buggy I don't really care if the taste isn't as a1 as long as it gets me more late which I'm not saying this one won't get you more loot to this because you just got a pie smoked out of this a little longer but the quality of it I mean you're ingesting into your body so I guess at the end of the day you gotta make decisions sometimes young but I think it would be worth paying a little extra to go for like quality but that's just my preference medium pool do like the flavors still consistent and it's crazy how these trips like play a role with your mouth huh pause right they like they don't dry your mouth up you know I feel like this is over the battery it would get hot really quick and dry my mouth up now I'm not sure if it's also because it's a disposable that the quality might be a little different on the battery I'm not sure you know but dowsers my experience I'm gonna take a long pull out of this I'm so baked I feel like all right it's gonna pull down this fire this fire so I would definitely say they're both really good products because at the end of the day even though this one doesn't have like the best flavor in the world it gets you so big I was like baked out of my mind earlier what this was like uncomfortably be do you know what I'm saying this one however gives you a better experience like it's more premium it's probably way better for your lungs and it just tastes better all around I feel like the high is really good and the more you hit it too higher you're gonna get so it's really up to you what you want but yeah your boy mr. THC if you guys enjoyed this video because you got smash that like button let me know what you guys want me to do next on this series cheapest vs. most expensive out", "h7FpHksFtpc": "yeah hey beaver

cannabis review today i'm going to be reviewing the buddies liquid diamonds live resin cartridge strain on this one is sherbert or sherbet i don't i don't know not really sure if they spelled that wrong or what but buddies liquid diamonds live resins are pretty much my go-to card as of right now they're very good quality i would say like gold standard of quality for their price um you can get slightly better stuff but you're gonna end up paying part uh prices that i i wouldn't consider worth it anymore so these are a very good cartridge itself very good oil inside it's very consistent it's very terpy and has a good effect every single time so you know what you're getting so let's get into the packaging and then i will open it up try it out and we'll see what i think all right so here's the packaging up close as you can see i buy a lot of these they even give me a bulk buff for them um let's grab one of these out here i've taken the sticker off so you can see they put the price sticker over these so not too much being missed on these sides luckily so i'll toss that aside here so we got what are we looking at here it's 72.27 percent thc one point zero seven percent cannabidiol um seventy eight point five percent total cannabinoids in indica but um if you ask me straight names or indica steve doesn't need anything anymore with cross breeding we'll get the side information let you pause that and read it if you want to and then you have nothing on that side nothing on the bottom buddies logo on the top and then i love about these is you got the terp profile well at least top three so you can kind of know what you're going to be getting into some more info there the verification that rc number um i got this one because it has humulene in it i've been really looking for that but you'll find a lot of these that's not a good example but a lot of these are much more terpy let's see if i can find i've had these come up to 16 turks and it was just like ridiculous okay it's funny now i can't even find them so maybe they are average i would say six to nine percent terpenes for the distillates closer to uh like one to four percent there we go there's those are two so yeah this stuff's pretty terpy it's good stuff though i'll get to open it now all right let's get into it my vessel rolling around here pop it open here i don't remember what that says when i focus then you got that which just fell out but that's all right um you got the tube that it always comes in pretty sure it's upside down which will list a thc enabled cbd instead of cbg then card itself it's a very nice looking liquid live resin i found this stuff which i think is usual for live resin can occasionally be even like a little bit liquid at room temp flowing somewhat freely and stuff but i believe that just um was with the two that were extremely derpy like 12 to 14 percent so i always take the stickers off here i'll finish up later now let's pop it in excited to see what sherbet sherbet is like and right away that's just such a smooth hit the pool has like some nice resistance you get amazing vapor from it so i love that draw tip it's really pretty slick all right so i mean taste wise the last couple i had were about almost like double the terpene yeah terpene content so this one's kind of weak for me but really hard to pin down actually it's very neutral but um i would just say it's like it's it's vaguely vaguely sweet vaguely herbal that humiliating adds something i'm trying to describe it because humulin is what is in hops and beer so if you know that flavor that's what i'm getting from this you'll see a lot of this stuff you'll probably um if you want to look into terpenes ever you'll know that a lot of other foods and stuff have these terpenes so you can get an idea of what you're going to taste which is what i love about these carts they show you so yeah we're getting um cardio filling which is like kind of peppery it's almost the same amount with limonene so those are matching up with a kind of citrusy taste and then it's kind of complemented by like a a hoppy taste which i'm not a beer drinker and especially whenever i was it was nothing hoppy at all i do not like ips or anything so i'm not familiar with that i can't really like explain it well but that's what it would taste like if you know that so really really a good cart for thirty dollars i paid um thirty six dollars for recreational users i have my med card definitely recommend that i recommend at least trying it if you usually go for a distillate card or any other ones this is like my go-to so hope you enjoyed the video i'm going to be trying to get another one here because i picked up some distillate syringes and i'll be getting those once my ceramic cartridges come in so hope to see you then thanks for watching", "cCX6C3XH5cE": "how's it going guys I let go benzyl here thousand tape okay so this right here guys is so lucky GMO live rosin and

other homies today to talk moana that's right we're back with wanna uh surely i'm not gonna take the time to link below uh the video where i screwed up reviewing them before so we are here to review them in earnest today they're watermelon hybrid gummies uh this is a vegan gummy from wanna coming in at 20 bucks from my dispensary so this puts this at the uh highest end of the gummy um edibles at my dispensary so a bit of a premium for the wanna gummies um but nothing else too fancy here pretty basic packaging from wanna with their hybrid watermelon gummies we're gonna do it nice and short and quick here so that we don't upset the j-man we're going to pinch here as it says open it up and there are our wanna weed watermelon gummies manufactured by high life farms we've got our wonderful lab testing results and all of our stuff my cameraman is currently being uh pulled away by the dogs at this moment but that's okay here we go here is our watermelon gummy looking really nice and square how wonderful watermelon sugar weed aftertaste not bad pretty good well i am now my own cameraman again um and these wanna weed gummies well if you've had a weed gummy before you know what to expect um a lot of sugar to mask the taste and a pretty hefty cannabis aftertaste but i have certainly had worse uh and haven't had too many that are quite a bit better in terms of taste but it's not about how it tastes about how it makes you feel and for that guys i'm gonna come back to you in about two hours after i finish another whole hell a lot of a hell of a lot of these gummies and once i do i'll come back and i will let you know if these wanna weed gummies are as good as we all wanted them to be ugh anyways say hi stay healthy we'll see you back here in just a bit goodbye welcome back to wheat skies i'm back from paradise on earth or what was it called jesus's cameraman do you remember desert christ park welcome back to wheats guys i'm back from desert christ park or something like that the place with all the jesuses uh where we first tried the wanna cannabis infused watermelon hybrid gummies and these are pretty good gummies uh i'm not a hundred percent sure they're worth the 20 premium uh they are uh sort of better quality than the cheapest gummies for sure uh but whether they're the uh sort of eight dollar premium i'm not a hundred percent but they are definitely good quality and if you are concerned about um healthiness in your gummies excuse me guys there's a dog who's really just insistent go get them get out of my face um so if you're really concerned about your uh health and all that these are vegan uh and they are all natural flavors and colors nothing artificial here so uh they also claim to be artisan quality whatever that means anyways uh good quality stuff still pretty high from these uh it's been about three hours since i had my last one and still i am quite high so that is a pretty good endorsement right there and then anytime we have a product we like this much i'll take that camera person she's driving us all crazy go get just get out of our face just just just kid it's it's going to make it worse anytime we have a product we like this much i like to give a little cherry on top a little something extra that's not weed related so i'm out here in the middle of nowhere in the middle of uh god's country and anytime i'm out in the desert i think you know area 51 ufos sci-fi and we've been doing board games recently so i'm going to give you one of my favorite board games of all time one very cosmic and theme and that's cosmic encounters plays like five six seven eight players uh it is too hard too difficult to explain right here but i can tell you it's going to be one of the best times if you have friends who are into board games if you've never heard of cosmic encounters and you have a group that is willing to um do something different give cosmic encounters a try don't even remember who designed it right now that's because of wanna gummies and these wanna i was gonna make another one a pun but i'm too high so just you know uh know that that is an endorsement and that's going to be endorsement as well for cosmic encounters on your local board game store or online in some way i guess we're still in the middle of a pandemic board games are a weird thing to endorse but um they're an optimistic one and i'm rambling thanks guys it's been a it's been a blast here i'm sorry about the dog i'm sorry about all the jesus stuff you know uh we're just uh we're out here on vacation having a good time here on

educational purposes only don't watch this video olestra over 18 don't smoke marijuana less you're in a legal state or you have a medical marijuana card like I actually do myself I don't wanna show you my personal information yo what's up guys you're on your money back at you so this video I have another cartridge reveal for you guys but first off um I'm sure you guys like all heard about like cartridges getting like um like banned in certain states by now and like people getting lung infections and passing away and like all that [ __ ] you know what I mean so I'm just like really curious to know what you guys think about like all that it's like go look everything going on I'm curious to know what you guys think so tell me down below in the comments um yeah I'm thinking about making a video on the subject myself so if you guys want to see a video about me talking about that subject let me know down below in the comments - yeah I don't know that whole thing is just like crazy and I just wanna know what you guys think about it so but besides from that um in this video I don't know if you guys seen it or not but we're going to be reviewing the branch rib and I've actually reviewed this brand before if this [ __ ] wants to focus please yes I've actually as it upside down yeah it was is I've actually reviewed this program before in the past but I never reviewed the own the live resinous aren't sauce cards so this is sounds fire especially this rate I got too banana and cream sauce like banana and cream sauce I don't know that just [ __ ] so inspired at least to me in my opinion like banana and cream sauce live resin sounds fired as [ __ ] so if you guys seen that it's tested at seventy seven point four percent THC 0.5 percent CBD at point almost point one for almost one percent CBD m5 CBN which I'm not going to familiar what that is if you guys want to educate me it is leave a comment down below some will be some over the packaging real quick I won't waste too much time on there and then we'll open this up we'll get to smokin on it if you guys want to see more reviews I like these pods let me know down below in the comments too cuz I was looking spots heavy um besides from now yeah just happened to the snow so the front of it is said um this drip or nose extracts live present sauce bait my huge five point eight milligrams suppose that happen yeah it's a half a gram part I don't know why this [ __ ] doesn't want to focus right now there we go just so yeah drip see it decide take this little sticker off its own on this time she said some premium quality drip extracts and oils so a pretty simple packaging you know to me the bad just has like the Arizona's Department with that department of health warning all that good [ __ ] that they had to put on it you know what I mean test results on this side you know I mean then you just pull it out like this yeah you just slide it out like that and you're greeted with this so the first look at the cart of bananas and cream sauce [ __ ] this sounds fire to me my opinion so I'm expecting this to taste like so yeah I'm expecting this to taste like [ __ ] amazing so the way I usually like your beauty videos is I'll go over like the packaging to the packaging I'll give this like I actually like to like this package in a lot is just like not too much details on the package and like about the actual oil itself not I mean if you guys want to you can go on the website and check them out whether it's social medias right there yeah go check them out if you guys want you definitely have some fireeyes products but I wish you just have a little bit more information about the oil one strain on the packaging but besides from that it's I like it on least like I like how they put like the shiny letters and I don't know it's just it's dope you know I mean I don't know I just like the package inside if it had more details on like more information about the the strain and like just the oil itself I'll probably give it a 5 out of 5 but but since it's like lack and the information a little bit I'm gonna give it like a four and a half out of five but that's just like the packaging so the packaging pretty dope next we're gonna go over like that the looks of the oil slick not like that the quality or taste there anything you're gonna mean just the [ __ ] the looks of it so this is looking a little dark but not bad I mean it could be like that the comodoro could be big but it could be due to like this trillion it could be good like how they like so many [ __ ] fact there's there's so many different variables I could look at that the color the oil but the clarity in like the assistance these like the most important or everything else this oil is a little bit art I'm not gonna lie the consistency is like fire though this it's not movement as you guys see the clarity is there I mean you can see straight through it there's no like fogginess or no white [ __ ] in it you know I mean so that's a good sign they mean it someone it's medical dispensary I buy [ __ ] drip products all the I know about fishes I know this is some fire I know it's not no like booty juice in here so I mean it's just I never seen like the oil this dark or that's interested but like I said I never had those sauce cards before but besides from that [ __ ] to my battery um there's gonna be smoking this off of um my CB v so yeah we're gonna be smoking this carted off my CBD 5-pin there were nice too nothing to send me this pin and actually [ __ ] with her a lot whatever pens I had yeah um the looks of the war dodo one out of five the consistency is definitely there like I mean like this [ __ ] is like no I'm moving at all that's not for have an hourglass right there the clarity is there you can see it like how dark the oil is you can see straight through you know what I mean but I don't know I'm not really liking the color too much I wish it was a little bit lighter but everything else about is fire um I was gonna say 4.5 out of 5 but if it's only because like the strain that is this color I've learned I can't really give it a negative rating because of that so I don't really know yet maybe I'm just gonna say 4.5 out of 5 when it looks a bit so now we're gonna do a little taste test so I'm gonna turn the song I happen in the lowest temperature so I'm gonna take a couple small hits real quick see what this tastes like and do all good [ __ ] I'm gonna put it like a little high yeah I'm gonna put on the higher temperature take a couple of batter hits do my little smoke test and like a little high test yeah they're not available I'll go over like the price point with you guys a little bit and then um we'll just to like overall review and then I mean so yeah stuff you guys are smoking along I hope you guys have spoken up the bank and you guys are Cheers let's get it again we're just I'm gonna taste this first so Cheers yeah yeah I barely hit that [ __ ] that [ __ ] ripped that [ __ ] like definitely has that lung expansions in yeah so that should definitely if you like one one expansion in your chest um yeah blow me going for another hip dose I don't really get too much taste in that here so um yeah Cheers so it tastes more like this like this strain I should have expected this I don't know why I was expecting to taste like some like them what does it bananas and cream yeah I was expecting that tastes more like the flavour bananas and cream rather than the strain that doesn't cream um if you guys know that the strain but how does in cream it's um that's a cross between like blue dream banana hoji and like a Ocean Beach oh gee it emits like a strong note of orange and like experiment in this thing yeah so has like a like I'm strong like a orange and experimentation know what I mean and that's definitely what this tastes like you can definitely taste like that um the orange you like it's like minty flavor I don't it's like definitely like a weird unique taste kinda hard to describe let's think I guess that's the best way you can describe it it's like an orange like mint taste kind of it's not the most tasteful I'll give it like a three-and-a-half four out of five that's not the worst tasty car it's [ __ ] fire it's definitely probably um I'll be going from one wearing it don't put on higher temperature and do that little high test so Cheers yeah definitely fire though but I definitely taste like that strain more than my passion but and isn't cream flavor but yeah I'll give a like a three and a half or four or five somewhere around there but let me put this on the medium I'll put on the medium temperature in the middle temperature so I'm gonna take a couple fatter rips now I'm probably thing up when hearing it this time so so yeah let's see all the smokes now and then we'll do a little high test to it so Cheers if you guys are smoking along again let's go that's definitely fire ooh when you think of that rip with that you can definitely feel that in your chests like almost like a [ __ ] tab like um um definitely [ __ ] fire um let me go for one more hit and then I'll give the higher a little taste but let me go a little bit hit you know I'll get the higher reading but the way this smokes I think I make of that like a 5 out of 5 because I just moved wow you guys seen issues so the way smokes 5 out of 5 I guess that also kind of depends on your battery you know what I mean and the temperature and a whole bunch of [ __ ] but the way I'm talking it's 5 out of 5 but let's hop back into this so I'm gonna do one more hit then we'll do a little high reading and then we'll go with the price point [ __ ] so series and let's go oh definitely a fire card here's another look at the oriole focus there's no last look at the world pretty far I mean it doesn't look like the most potent oil with [ __ ] away trips yeah this is fired it away smokes think I said 5 out of 5 at least for the one smoking for me right now but the high test I mean or the high reading I should say I'll get the high up for a car that's fire I'm not gonna lie I'll give it like a four point two out of five it's a pretty fire car but I've had better parts that were more potent obviously out there so it's not like the best part I've ever had but it's up there with some of them the price point it was $45 which is a little pricey for a half ground cart but considering this is like made without real live resin I know there's a lot of brands out there that claim to use live resin but a lot of them really don't I know for sure this is this company like they actually ain't there one of the friends that actually like they do that they actually do use live resin you and I mean so for the quality you can justify paying a little bit more but forty five bucks for a half a gram or that's kind of a lot you know I mean I can get almost like two to three brands of wax for that price so the price point I'm gonna give that like a three and a half out of five maybe three-point-eight out of five I don't know it's somewhere around there I still I've been saying this forever but I feel out of cards need to get a little bit cheaper they just they're good for the convenience II like the portability and how easy they are the smoke but like I feel like to put the price point on them grow like I mean if you did it like if all you do is smoke cards like if you bought it's like a half gram card last seems like a month when you buy a half a gram of wax that [ __ ] will probably last you twice as long as a cartwheel and it's pretty known it means so that's the one thing I don't like about cards when I go to a concert or something like that you know I mean all right did he discrete that's when they're like really really helpful and like come in handy I still feel like I'm gonna get Reapers you guys agree with hear it disagree with me let me know down below in the comments but the overall score on this car 45 bucks for this own Nana cream live resin sauce card reading on this like a overalls for a four out of five a fire card but the price point is a little bit expensive like I was just saying um there's a couple of other brands out there that are around the forty five dollar price point out honestly me I'd prefer to kick over this court but not to say that this part isn't fired but I just I don't know these brands that I'd rather have in this brand but it's still a fire car you know that means so I'd still be picking up I mean I don't know the main I saved on a lot of videos but mainly only pick up arch and a half I won't get one free Thea was going to me because I feel like that's when you get the best bang for your buck not to keep this video stretch um yeah I don't know if you guys want to see some more car reviews and videos like this we've spoken and [ __ ] like that I'm gonna down below in the comments and you guys are you know I'll do that ship uh besides for that I feel like the Lighting's in a little bit [ __ ] up in this video I apologize for that but give the video a thumbs up comment like subscribe like that's [ __ ] you really know what to do spend your money ready peace out", "ZEhgLC8pOVs": "[Music] it's got to do with cartridges and I just wanted to say I'm in Orlando Magic yeah anyways so cartridges we're gonna be talking about cartridges so I've been getting kingpins and kingpins have actually been pretty decent you know I know they've had a bad reputation but for a state that isn't doesn't have recreational or legalized yet that you know so that's pretty much the best that we're gonna get and I made another video touching down on exotic cards do not buy exotic cards bro and I know you can fight kingpin [ __ ] this and that whatever but like kingpins

to community cannabis review today i'm gonna be reviewing a dr jolly's jolly stick cart which is a live resin cartridge um i've reviewed these before but the ones that i got before were on sale um super on sale actually because they were super old they were like a year old um and i didn't realize that when i bought them but i've got a new one this was made just under two months ago so this is their new production ones so i will show you what the packaging is like and then i'll talk about uh talk about it and hit it so let me get to showing you what it's like [Music] [Applause] uh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] uh [Music] all right so let's get into this i got slightly into filming there and then i didn't realize i didn't have any space left so it stopped me filming but luckily i didn't get too far into it so i'll read off the info first this is a live resin the strain is tangelo and it is at coming in at 92.16 total terps and cannabinoids with 72.7 percent thc and 7.45 terpenes it's also a sativa so um first off i'm a huge fan of dr jolly's both their extracts and the one or the two cards that i didn't try from them um even the old carts were super good so i'm expecting a lot from this one being made just under two months ago um i really like a lot of things about dr jolly's great extractors great flavors all that great range of terpenes i also like the testing that they do they're very in-depth on the on the testing which i should have showed you a close-up of but i'll read it off so the terpene profile is beta mir seen 2.6 beta cardiophiline 1.1 beta pharmacin 1.1 percent um something limiting 0.5 percent alpha pharynxine uh 0.5 sorry sound out there um so it looks like it's going to be a very um fairly interesting um tarp profile the farnessine tastes appley in my opinion or like yeah that's a good way to put it it's like that sort of flavor then it's got the limiting in there and then the standard like you're seeing cardio filling but it sounds like it'll taste interesting so the cannabinoid profile pretty in-depth um thc a is at twelve point fifty percent delta nine thc is that sixty one point seven four percent delta eight txt is at zero point two five percent thc va is at 0.23 thc v is at 0.38 and so on there's a lot of these like fine or a lot of these more rare ones like cbd va at 0.04 percent i don't know if that's as rare but um for example cbn 0.57 cbg 2.4 percent four percent um cbc uh actually got cbca at 3.78 and cbc is at one point five nine percent so a lot of cannabi chromine um there's 0.26 percent cbt don't even know what that is 0.35 percent cbla 0 um 0.13 delta 10 thc so on um yeah very interesting thing and they got a lot of cool little clips on here grown and processed in-house in bend origin and it says i like this one it says preventing cannabinoid deficiency since 2014. all right so that's the packaging a lot of info on this little package but let's get on to the cartridge itself so it's a beautiful looking live resin this looks like a proper live resin i take off the sticker because i hate the stickers and let's see where i put the pin got the two silicone caps that most do and now i don't see any branding or anything like c cell on the cartridge but looks to be a fine cartridge to me not sure where it's made i would prefer it to be a c cell but who knows bear with me i'm having a tiny bit of issues getting it to fit in this pin alrighty i don't actually think that it's going to fit in this pin weirdly but it is a 510 thread so if i can find my other pin i will pop it in that so bear with me real quick all right back to it so um trusty select pin that i got from the select rep this thing always comes in handy when other pins don't work because the threading on it's a little finer all right so that's a very good card um i like the terpenes in that a lot the farnescine that's a little bit that's a little different than i don't really get that one too often um it's hard to get much of a taste because this one gives me a lot finer vapor than my other other one does but let me get one more before i try this again that's much better um oh that's really nice that has a very like orangey taste without being just like a strong orange taste like i've gotten from like some like i remember the fruity pebbles or orange fruity pebbles cured resin that straight up tasted like uh it tasted a lot more like actual orange this hints at orange a lot um but it also has some other like weird taste i'm getting from it just kind of like um kind of like a grassy taste to it as well it reminds me of um i don't know what it might be yeah it's kind of a grassy taste as well which i'm assuming that's how mirzin tastes so it's probably there's just a mirror scene that's leading there but yeah you get some nice um like hints of like citrusy and uh fruity appley type flavor afterwards as far as the hit and like the oil it's amazing really really good stuff yeah i feel a very like it's very full spectrum i can definitely tell um it helps to have all those cannabinoids in there which i'm sure a lot of extracts have and just aren't they don't test that finely but this one for sure does as opposed to like distillate or something which probably won't have any of it all right i'll close out this video very good cartridge though dr jollies i always recommend them super cool packaging and artwork and info and all of it really and of course most importantly the oil itself very good live resin i'm pretty sure it's just live resin yeah not like a mix of distillate or anything all right um one more hit and thanks for watching like and subscribe and have a great day", "3qqP7SXaAVE": "hi tim here i just wanted to talk about one of the new cartridge products that we got called core pods this is the core pod hawaiian haze is the flavor of this one these are a little different than all the other cartridges that we carry and that they're not actually a cartridge they're a pod system so it's going to use a different type of battery than the standard c cell that the rest of our our cartridges use but i really like these they hit really well they have really good strains this one is hawaiian haze it has like a really nice smooth coconutty flavor really smooth hits really strong and it's from the brand core which if you tried any of our tiara grow flower it's the same same company that's making these core pods really high quality i just really like them be sure to make sure you have the right battery to go with them if you do get them but it's definitely worth the investment to get the battery because they're great great price great effect i really like", "xDwNRZaaWOE": "hey what's up guys - Jimmy Jam the dad man back here with another video review in today's review is gonna be on none other than dang fates lemon skunk now this lemon skunk comes in at ninety three point eleven percent THC and what I do like about dang tapes is they claim to be all organic and use no propylene glycol this is a tank vapes official if you do have dank vapes official account that is a legit box if you have dating papers official that is a legit box they change their boxes a few months back or a while back they change their boxes so dang favs official or tank vapors official account it's a legit box so I will be showcasing a cart here later in this video right after I test this bad boy and then I will be reading from the back of this box which I do really love about all these dang tapes is they have a little back of the description which I will leave down in the description below but thank favs was made by denk woods in California and yeah they are a C cell cartridge and the easiest way to get these cartridges out is to the bottom so before I do that though guys I do have like the Box here that is to move so um I will tell you there is some Rove's in here there's some kingpin so yes but without further ado let's get into the review so this is lemon skunk running it at THC content is running in at ninety three point one 1% THC now as you can see the box it is a nice small cap and barrel swung car it is it looks like the Disney skunk right dude Mel Mel C I and Mel skunk eat they fell no Mel C no smoke no I do believe well thank you so the easiest way to open these cards is there at the bottom right there so like I said before the dank Bates has a little description I will be leaving that down below so I will show you guys this oil now it is like a darker oil not like a

third second favorite is my third favorite skittles nerds mystery og I'm out", "nqT_otOuUnM": "what's going on guys welcome to the deaf connection and today we're gonna be telling you the difference between real authentic and fake serial cards so before I even say anything about this I just want to say quickly about the company there's no like telling if this is even a legit company to begin with so there's like no information to be found on them online the only thing I did find was an Instagram account but it's private so you can't see anything at all and apart from that dang creeps show them a lot in their Instagram accounts so like if not every day every other day they'll be posting sharing cereal carts and a lot of people know cereal cars by 10 faves actually but with that being said because they're unknown if they're legit or an authentic company in the first place they could be fake overall but we're still not too sure and um we did encounter like this is a legit when a supposedly quote-unquote real one and we did get fake ones we knew we noticed right away so the first indicator to tell if they're fake was not packaging so check this out the one in the right is fake right this one's fake or this one's real this one's real the one that has oil in it or distal is fake and look maybe a little hard to see but if it's a little difficult to tell the one in the right has a lot more holograph like a holograph package to end appointing left doesn't at all so hey let me show you the back actually so you can see a little better yeah I don't know if you could tell from this video we look at that on the logo or says serial cards to see how the one in her eyes a lot more shinier than the left so that's a huge indicator right away both of these cartridges are plain looking like bland that you could say they have no shine or hologram to it whatsoever so that's the main indicator a another one is the coloring the packaging so if you take a look this one's actually a lot more lighter the cereal itself is a lot more lighter than this one like this one's a darker stronger color not darker but stronger color so just a really light faded go6 internet so scrunch one so with that with a packaging excuse me with the packaging you can tell that right away but you could also tell with the cartridge itself so the serial card stands beeps and all of those companies they use authentic cecil cartridges and this thing you can actually tell this um with this you could tell if they're fake with dankmemes c or any other cards that you see sell cartridges but okay let me show you and another thing the oil is a sometimes the oil will be really really dark or really light make a strong clear gold color it usually it it should always look like this actually like with these fake ones the oil looked exactly the same so and they're not like too dense to quality oh and i've had to tell you another thing to notice is the taste so the every single car should taste literally exactly the same as this whatever the strain is these ones didn't taste nothing like the cereal itself it just tastes like artificial chemicals and flavors and vapors pretty much it wasn't strong but it was it was a light taste too but it still don't say it's that good so another indicator to tell is if they're authentic cecil cartridges check to so it's a little hard to tell if you can see that this only says Cecil it's just say all three stems here I'll show an image right now but it's just say all three stamps the case stamp see so and a see a stem and apart from that they should all have a the same font style they shouldn't be a different different color and misplaced or different font sizes or anything like that they should look exactly like the one that shown an image right now so yeah those are the main indicators to tell there's legit or even if they are legit legit cereal carts so you know a lot of fake vendors are something a lot of Chinese manufacturers are selling these things so alright before I let you guys go I'm on let me just show you really quick how this hits well you can see anything I'm Trevor yeah not very sad anything at all but those smoke is really light another thing I realized with these fake off and not been sexy cell cartridges the atomizer is weak so I have one pointers I was actually collecting a lot of reclaim up here I switched the batteries to a stronger stronger battery and it didn't go away but yeah those are how to had identify the fake serial cards if you guys ever encountered these have any information about them at all please post them in the comments below I love hearing about this and hope to see you guys soon see you later guys", "duKNE8y28yA": "it just goes to show and proves you smoke he smokes these every day every day he took a couple blinkers and he's done that's how strong these are educational and [Music] what's up youtube dope is y'all here hope you're having a dope ass day guys the other week we did a video exposing fake bad cards and i got a huge response about it i [ __ ] love that you guys loved the video hella information went to the lab shows you guys what's up the biggest complaint i got the only complaint i got was you didn't show how the [ __ ] you spot these bad cards how do you tell that it's fake i got a fake plug play guys these are real i talked to them after that video or actually while i was making the video and told them what's up and they hooked me up with real ones these look nothing like the ones that i brought to the lab you could tell they're [ __ ] different today guys i brought the man himself peter from plug play yes the guy you see on plug plays instagram all the time i brought peter he's gonna actually sit down with me show me and show me how i can tell everything's fake how to tell their bad how to go through all the packaging the seals everything because honestly guys i mean i got played so i have no knowledge in this but let's get started so guys here's the investigator dopaziola again my homie has somebody i told him i was doing this video and he says oh i have a homie that makes fake plug plays and i go hey man can you get me the guy's [ __ ] number so i could talk to him and see how cheap these [ __ ] carts he's doing because these are real i want to know how [ __ ] cheap does it really get i'm going to call him real quick hello hey what's up dude yeah i got you yeah no no i'm looking to uh get some of the plug play cards i know that he said that you probably haven't cheaper than my guy how much if i get 500 they're they're 10 bucks for the cart package and everything ready to go do you do a price break at a thousand eight bucks um could i give you a call back just want to make sure that we're good to go all right dude thank you bye-bye eight thousand dollars for a thousand plug play cards i want to show you guys right now look at i'm in my house and i could have ordered a thousand fake plug play cards just like that here's your phone back thank you so much yeah that never calls you back block it this is what's going on today while i'm doing this right now peter's on his way over here with the plug play team he's at a trap spot buying fake plug play cards yes the guy that you see does plug play is going investigator 2 to go buy fake ones he's gonna buy real ones and fake one every question you ever had today guys is going to be answered how to spot fake cards let's get this [ __ ] started all right here's peter right here hello here oh oh i see the car you know we had to make it official oh my god thank you brother get this side real quick just real quick you're rolling around in this to drop drop off orders and [ __ ] yeah it's a moving billboard all right guys here we are this is peter from plug play i'm sure you guys have seen them online what's up everybody so please do me a favor just tell everybody what plug play is about would you guys start and just the whole get down of it so we're a group of homies started the company three years ago came from the streets hustled our way became compliant became legal and now we're trying to build this as big as we can possibly do it but most importantly have fun with what we do you guys know this is the most asked for thing on my channel of all time for um for of all time the second i ever did a vape video people just asked all day like yo these are the best ones you guys gotta [ __ ] try it out i'm glad i'm sorry that it's uh that the first time i ever showed you guys on my channel it was a [ __ ] fake ass car i'm sorry about it i saw that [ __ ] man i saw that and i was like wait a minute to school me on what the [ __ ] happening bro it's a headache for not only us but everybody in this industry right now we're all battling it and most importantly it's up to our community to make sure that everybody stays aware of you know what the [ __ ] is happening they see your car however much they cost and then they see the ones i get two for 20. yeah but it's poisonous you don't know what it is and people are choosing like i want the brand name but i don't want the brand name as far as legalization and and the point that we're in right now it's just a very crazy difficult challenging time for the industry itself because this wasn't legal before and now it is with that change there also comes this area where we have to learn how to adapt to what's about to happen there was a time where nobody was compliant three years ago because there were no licenses there was none of that so it was like literally the wild wild [ __ ] out right it was just trapped but there was a code during those yeah it's bad because now it's the everyone jumped in because they saw money here to me so the people that really cared are getting pushed aside because they don't got money like that i feel like right now it it's eventually gonna find this perfect median to where everyone's happy the taxes are cool um i hope things are just different the black market that it's all trash products because there are some there's some bran there there are some good ones that have really clean products true are trying to make a name for themselves because everybody started off as a trash product and got legal yeah it doesn't mean that this was bad before it was legal they're entrepreneurs and they want to get into this space they want to do it right but the the industry is holding them back to to do it the right way never really thought about it that way because i mean i'm already in this [ __ ] i never thought about what it'd be like i'm trying to get it as a legal company as a compliant company that sells safe products we're very big on quality and making sure that there is absolutely nothing that gets through for everyone that that does [ __ ] with plug play this [ __ ] smacks right and smacks for a reason we focus on quality we focus on opponents he put that into our device i'm gonna be honest bro i do those blinkers i just don't wanna ding ready go [ __ ] i gotta take it again yo shout out to the plug play fam because everybody's been doing an amazing [ __ ] job with like banging on like unlicensed retailers right what we've come to find out is like we started calling around and a lot of these spots that that had been reported they no longer had them so it was actually it was actually pretty challenging for us to find a spot that had the fake ones all this [ __ ] that's getting sent out of state right where nobody's really informed they just see one what they want to see here busy brand here but this video today is going to show you how to never get it again i sent david in go go check it out and sure enough you know like they were fake he ended up buying a bunch of different products just so we can kind of [ __ ] around and look at it and yeah see uh what you can see what it is this is the bag that they give it to give you a paper bag it's a paper bag this is my wig at least staples this paper bag for me this is a shop this is a shop oh my god that's not good that's not a good look all right oh no that's trim look look what fell out that's trim automatic i'm gonna tell i'm gonna tell everybody why when i look at this it like freaks me the [ __ ] out what is it yo it says springfield cards that has bart literally guys do you think the simpsons licensed this no that's why you could tell it's automatically [ __ ] fake this this can fool some people so how can you tell that these are fake because this is the same looking one that i got but they've even made copies of these with the compliance package and the stippling and the sticker they can knock the sticker off yeah they knocked everything off the only way you can tell really is the way that the letters are printed so the difference for like the the fake ones that i've seen they don't have these plastic tabs on the side the ones that i've seen they have older batch numbers we sell out a product pretty quickly so if it's two months old you know it's probably fake let me talk about this specific one if you look at the difference in the actual sticker that's on here this is a completely different sticker i want you to compare it you see him oh [ __ ] it's not even that it says one gram on here and this doesn't have a shine watch so yeah point them out yeah look at it apple slushy looks identical dude except there's yours is outlined there's isn't yeah like such small details if you look at it even the color of the blue it's different yeah it's a little bit it's just different and then right there look at the exotics is a different color yeah and there's knockoff says but look at this this is the scary part look at their oil it's like clear just like yours clearer than ours oh [ __ ] but that doesn't mean there's this actual oil exactly it could be something else it could be something else all right which one's fake what do you [ __ ] learn so far there one gram automatic fake basically look on your instagram and see what the updated logos are too this is scary show us what is that this is tangy bang we don't even have a tangy bang flavor how can this can somebody go to like a website and see that what flavors you have your ig huh yeah just follow their ig guys so you can stay up on what flavors for sure it says packaged last month yeah this one this is this is ten this one's real that's the one you brought also this is scary this is scary too this oil might not be oil and say it is say it's [ __ ] great say it's [ __ ] bomb oil it's not tested well if these guys are doing such a great job at making this type of quality if it is good quality i'm not gonna chance it if they're doing that type of quality like go compliant right that or stop knocking off my brand and make your own [ __ ] brand for that damn good we have a responsibility to make sure that like we take care of our community so if anybody sends us a dm about a fake car or a concern about a fake car we gotta look at it that's your [ __ ] if someone were to get hurt i did i didn't answer dm and then that person had gotten hurt that's not like i don't want that it really is on you though that's the worst part about it i never really thought about it it's the stress yeah yeah it's so stressful the water building up i have like a body high now you're right oh yeah oh man i'm pretty big you're gonna get high as [ __ ] at the end oh my god no no i'm doing that i'll put my sunglasses back on have you ever seen the [ __ ] on the news where these [ __ ] vape pen batteries explode yeah and basically it's shrapnel to your eyes yeah i don't want that did you know people knock off plug play batteries everyone's batteries i didn't know that these can explode i got one right here he brought a fake battery they're knocking off these the batteries and it looks the [ __ ] it looks better than ours what you smoke a lot i do but not this extreme real plug plays real ones will [ __ ] you up apparently he's definitely not hitting the fake ones hell yeah yeah he's getting he's gonna be good jesus jesus christ just wait till the end we're about to get oh my goodness thumbnail right there i gotta go lay down your time oh my god my video came out try and hold on there as long as possible [Music] i had a pause for a moment because it got way too lit and needed to take a quick nap on this table they bought a fake plug plate uh battery also remember if they could blow up in your [ __ ] face how can you tell that they're fake well the thing is though with the box you couldn't even tell right i couldn't tell where the box was out of the box it's like boom like just look at the print so right off the bat the fake ones have white is this plays in white right yeah plays in white for the fake ones two months from now they're gonna they're gonna they're gonna catch on to this they'll catch up when you guys update your [ __ ] so it makes you guys on your toes all the time huh that packaging's dead on the same oh guys when you see the packaging look look at the [ __ ] barcodes they got it down they wouldn't bought a real one copied your barcode that's crazy right peter yeah almost there why is the big deal buying a fake uh battery there's a protection chip in there so when it's being charged and it's like fully charged it stops pushing energy into it yours yeah what's the big deal those could they could burn your house down they could blow up in your face anything they blow up right there because the chip they don't have a chip so it keeps pumping energy into it so it like overloads it too much basically the fake ones don't have the protection chip because that costs extra money exactly they're trying to pay pitch everyone's trying to get into the market right now corners like i said cutting corners man [ __ ] people up you back to life slowly that's because you're dope as yola bro i smoke a lot of weed i'm pretty much an alien when it comes to weed tolerances oh it's like a box all they don't hit they don't do [ __ ] to me that's what we does i'm high but i mean i'm here it just goes to show and proves you smoke he smokes these every day every day he took a couple blinkers and he's done that's how strong these are so i'm going to let peter get out of here so you can go take a damn nap peter thank you so much for stopping by i'll see you soon so thank you so much peter for stopping by these are right in front of me and i could still not tell they had the same barcodes so like peter said they can get this packed this is the knock-off box this is the real box they can knock it off they can make the same sticker everything guys they're getting so good with it how can you tell you're not going to get some fake stuff that could poison it could poison you so make sure you pay attention to this stuff this doesn't say one gram this does say one gram is outlined apple slushy on the fake one is not outlined those little things matter you literally have to be like antique roadshow [ __ ] to be able to go well you see this is here that's how you have to be right now those counterfeiters are following me too they're going to watch it they're going to watch us go damn all right we got to switch it up guys plug play you everybody all big companies they update their packaging often for counterfeiters this is the reason why counterfeiters are they're good they make fake gucci they make fake nikes and you couldn't even tell i'm sure somebody one of you has bought fake jordans once you guys can get dupes so don't get duped on shoes that's cool don't get duped on things you put in your lungs you guys heard it earlier i talked to that [ __ ] on the phone that means he's packaging these making them for probably five dollars five dollars there's no way that's thc real fake if you have any questions come back refer to this video and make sure you have the real ones real quick guys before we get out of here these right here they said they got for free for coming to the dispensary can we get a close-up i want to rip this open they gave him six free joints for coming in no no what is that why is it brown and yellow you see it there's yellow chunks in here why oh it's dead leaves oh it's trim oh this is true so guys this past month has been pretty wild we did exposing fake cards which led us to this because you guys asked so much how to spot fake cards how do you know if your cards fake how to spot fake packaging i'm so sorry i got you so high man but that's just that's what happens sometimes over here peter thank you so much for taking the time out of your day to first off go to the trap spot and get all these fake ones and then bring some real ones just to show us it was super

"c8x3h7_5j9s": "what's up guys I'm Rick quick review I got a helix cart from Oklahoma I'm the patient guard of course here's the back mr. Scott puppies eighty-one percent real real part taste test thank you good night", "rNE8BbB9rKU": "[Music] p2pt [Music] what's up y'all the sky high on georgia pie car just came in and here's my first impressions the smell is weird you know not weird in a like you know bad way but like i didn't expect it to smell so vibrant [Music] like it smells like a candy guys like it smells like a real sweet kind of peachy kind of candy cheers no way that tasted so much better than roper for labs hold on guys [Music] wow guys this is so much better than the rogue river carts but this georgia pie cart is amazing man what's up guys boy p2 peeps today we're going to be checking out sky hiyo's georgia pie delta 8 thc cart with the cannabis derived terpenes here's the cart itself you know not the packaging or anything like that we do have point three percent of delta nine and thc contained in this i will be putting the uh percentage of delta eight thc on the screen on the screen sorry uh but yeah let's go ahead and take a hit and uh let's talk about it guys i know you guys might have seen the first impression a little clip i had so you guys already know i'm a big fan of this flavor cheers y'all thank you for joining me on yet another video review cheers [Music] you know we got to do a blinker for the first hit that's customary so yeah delta a is kind of more known as the more harsh cannabinoid comparatively to cbd and delta 9. but this is pretty smooth and i'd say it's still much smoother than the rogue river labs car i take a blinker from a rogue river labs cart and i am dead the flavor here is great i think they got a good mix of terpenes in here now i'm not sure um if all the delta eight thc cards from sky high are gonna taste the same i'm going to assume as of this point in time no but that is you know a common theme with some brands guys you know raw garden sublime smokeland certain delta eight brands they they all kind of sometimes use a similar tert blend so that kind of makes all their strains kind of taste the same to me this doesn't i don't think it is like that but yeah going on to the taste it's very very sweet kind of almost like a peach sweet you know like a picnic when you have a cup of peaches in syrup you know like the you know the to-go things uh to go fruit bowl things that you can get in a snack container or a lunchables or something so i'm kind of getting that level of sweetness from this not too much else maybe a little bit of pineness but that's about it there the potency on this thing is pretty nice just you know going off my previous experience of having some of it yesterday and a little bit of it today you know i i like the hot we're getting a nice head high there which kind of normally goes standard i think for delta 8 thc it normally starts with a little head high that kind of pulls you back in a sense like it feels like the back your head is is is is going backwards in a sense like you know like i said like look a little pullback i couldn't find any straight uh strain info you know about the cross of georgia pie but the strain itself is a seed junkie genetics cross so you know if you guys know seed junkie genetics that guy's making some of the best fire around you know the homie freddy has some of his genetics as well that is you know growing up so this is really good stuff um strain wise strain why so i'm probably going to go ahead and look into uh seed junkie and see if i could figure out the georgia pi uh cross yeah i'm enjoying the dirt profile on this you know like i said really peachy kind of flavor almost like that syrupy kind of pizza a little fruit bowl thing so i'm going to take another hit here see if we can get this high a lot more potent see what else i might be feeling off this thing cheers y'all [Music] i gotta say guys this is really one of the most impressive d8 cards i've had honest i am super impressed with this thing like the flavor is done very well nice and smooth and it's almost to the point where um you know if it weren't for the color i would barely able be able to tell that the difference between this and a delta nine thc car you know potency wise of course you can always tell the difference you know but if you're someone who doesn't smoke that much this is going to be great for you honestly like if if you can't handle any delta 9 thca all that stuff delta 8 and cbd is most likely going to be the route for you and if you want the closest thing to that psychoactive high of delta nine go ahead i definitely recommend delta eight let's take one more hit here guys uh but potency wise pretty good setting in a little bit more um the head high is not getting as intense as i thought it would um after hitting it again it's actually kind of not flowing a little bit more downwards um i'm feeling my back is feeling actually really good now now that i think about it um not now i was gonna say this i'm gonna preface this was saying this this is it's not stronger than delta nine to me to me you know if i took a dab of uh let's let's say these bear labs guava fake diamonds right if i took a dab of this is it's completely gonna overwrite whatever this is you know if i take a blinker of my sublime ceramic cart you know this this is probably gonna overwrite this you know i'm gonna take two blinkers of this this is gonna get me probably a little bit more higher than this will but that's okay guys you know this is not supposed to be beating delta nine you know it's supposed to be an alternative to that so let's take another hit yo but yeah this is uh one of the best ones i've had so far i can't wait to try the other uh sky hill carts i have here you know we got cereal milk and white runs to go so very very very excited for those strains and you know these strains aside from the georgia pie actually are strains i've had in real life so i could probably make a better uh distinction between them or something hopefully hopefully thank you guys for watching up to this point you know and if you have not drop a like for the homie drop a little comment let me know what you are smoking on and which of these three strains sounds more appealing to you man the georgia pie the cereal milk the white ones man which one would you get and if you have been enjoying and not been subscribed please hit that subscribe button it's for the free skis man and the nerdy bill is too so you know you hit both of those you're going to know when i'm i upload when i live stream all that stuff you know i want to have a more ironed out concrete schedule again i mean i feel like a lot of people just kind of forget the schedule sometimes so i'll probably talk about it a lot more and try to make a more considerate effort to push it out there cheers everybody thanks for coming through with them good vibes as always [Music] so [Music] three blinkers in like less than five minutes that's about less than ten minutes is that definitely gonna hit you but that's about it for this review guys taste wise right this is completely peachy you know i'm not really getting much of anything else just a really nice deep sweetness the terps here are fantastic man great job to sky ohio you know really good mix of terp and oil and potency-wise not too bad at all for a delta eight cartridge i honestly think that this is gonna be one of my favorites so far especially because of the flavor um but yeah if you guys are wondering how it stacks up to the ruger for labs potency-wise i do think that the wedding cake and black lime were just a tad bit stronger than this but we'll see how that cereal milk and white runs do and all that but so far very very satisfied with sky ohio and another thing guys is you should try to order all your delta eight before the march 27th ban um uh they're going to be banning delta eight being shipped in you know in packages through the usps and all that stuff um pretty soon the usps is though kind of reconsidering it so if you guys do want to buy delta 8 for the future or do want to help the people who are trying to keep this thing legal in you know the mail then please go google that the usps is uh like i think i think there's a form or an org you can join i i believe but yeah just go ahead and google that up and you know fight the good fight if that's what you want to do but thank you guys for tuning in and watching i hope you guys come back for another video or a live stream or something like that i do enjoy it when i see all these familiar faces and new faces in the streams and comment sections and all that so thank you guys for joining me take one last little puff here yeah go with good vibes everybody and have a great day night afternoon whatever time it may be yeah pizza out peace you",

mainstream what is the actual difference between CBD and THC inside you right now there's a biological pathway at work called the endocannabinoid system that helps regulate your mood appetite memory and pain sensation THC and CBD though hijack this system this is the chemical structure of THC also known as tetrahydrocannabinol if you are feeling fancy and this is the chemical structure of CBD also known as cannabidiol what you may notice is that their chemical structures seem almost identical they have the same molecular formula which is C 21 H 3002 and both of their masses clocking at 314 grams per mole but there is one extremely important structural difference where THC contains a cyclic ring CBD contains a hydroxyl group and this difference in biochemistry actually controls whether or not you feel high in order to fully understand why you need to first know about the cb1 receptor in your unstoned to sober body your cb1 receptor is affected by a neurotransmitter called an and amide which controls generation of pleasure motivation and feeding behavior in your unstoned body and manda mine is released after exercising and it's what causes a runner's high THC structure is so similar to Ananda mine that it fits in perfectly to the cb1 receptor therefore causing you to feel high CBD on the other hand because of the hydroxyl group is different in shape and does not fit into the cb1 receptor therefore it doesn't make you feel high but CBD does bind to other receptors in your cannabinoid system affecting you in other ways a lot of excitement came around a 2011 study where a few dozen people with social anxiety disorder were asked to speak in front of a large audience some were given CBD some were given a placebo those who were given CBD reported significantly less anxiety there are also many animal studies showing CBDs anti-anxiety and anti-inflammatory properties which can explain why some people say it helps with their anxiety and with chronic pain research is also discovering that THC can actually a head Grove eight psychotic symptoms while CBD on the other hand may help with psychosis so what happens when you consume them at the same time one study found that due to CBDs biochemical shape it can actually bind to the cb1 receptor and turn it off in a binding pattern known to biologists as allosteric inhibition this means that CBD actually makes the THC unable to bind as well and therefore decreases how high you feel if you vaporize marijuana with 25% THC and 0.1% CBD you will feel high as the THC is going to bind to the cb1 receptor with little interference from CBD if you consume marijuana with 25% THC and 12% CBD this more CBD will inhibit the THC from binding to the cb1 receptor decreasing th DS effect and leading you to being less high where marijuana is legally sold likely they will indicate what percentage of THC and CBD is in the product you are choosing which will help you to understand the effects that will have on your body in the end THC is a chemical found in marijuana with a chemical structure that makes you feel high CBD is a chemical found in marijuana with a different chemical structure that doesn't make you feel high but it can affect your body in other less obvious ways there is still conflicting research and a lot more to understand about both chemicals with more states and countries legalizing marijuana hopefully increased research can uncover more details about how these two chemicals affect us because weed is now legal in Canada we created a new series called stoned science where we make comedians get high and try to explain complex science concepts our first episode is about the respiratory system so click here to watch it and let us know what you think as we continue to evolve this

the full gram was 45 so half a gram was like 25 30 bucks so it's lit so um but it says it's going to taste like berries sweet grape and the effects are calm euphoric delighted so that's good as [ __ ]

looks really good i like it weird a little bit dude it's all good though let's try this all right yo now let's attach it to our battery i'm using the imini it's lit yeah you definitely get like that

"XSFrzkVRPNY": "[Music] what's up guys simplisec here back with another video if you can tell from the title it is another reaction video but this one's going to be on the clean cards not the fake carts you guys have been asking for a part four for a few months now you know and uh now that um for tuesdays i'm mainly gonna be doing reaction videos till i can stream again i wanted to do a clean cart one because one of the videos is actually picking up steam right now and if it's picking up steam might as well add another one because that that tells me that people are watching that and i know you guys have wanted this one as well and uh before i start this for any further the clean cards moderators i do not know any of them i don't give a [ __ ] about any of them uh because most of you guys say that they're mostly douche bags and stuff and like self-righteous in some ways but i would like to say that i am in no way affiliated with them it's just me reacting to their subreddit and uh just seeing what the legal cards are in the whole country you know what i'm saying i do have a card for this video you know i've been slacking with cards in terms of you know i'm making a fake cartridge video i don't even i'm not even smoking out of a cart this is actually the moonwalker brand uh video will be out in a few days but you know with these reaction videos i try to get these out the day that i record them that way you can follow along you know while i'm watching the video i guess but cheers for those of you who don't know this is delta eight it's called moonwalker the strain is called grape runts and honestly it's one of the better distillate cartridges that i've tried d8 or d9 it's just really flavorful now you do get a strong taste of grape if you guys are interested in this it will be in the comments below you can actually buy these in 38 states so shout out to moonwalker like i said videos on this product will be out in a few days but let's take another hit oh you can see the clearness in it that was bad so as usual with these reaction videos i like to post the comments from the previous video at least the best ones so here we go right now [Music] all right now that we're here let's just see what the clean card subreddit's been doing since uh since the last video right tnt extra expo in new york is this legit or did i waste 40 bucks [ __ ] come on what the [ __ ] let's just let's just take a look at what people say use your account to rebound or another thing [Music] well if it last time made you sick and you bought another one come on come on well let's be honest washington state bans iso isomerized tse and recreational marijuana system what is isomerized oregon to limit use of delta eight tac and other artificially derived cannabinoids really this week's lineups from com can in millis massachusetts we get the pax error okay okay friendly farms terp hogs so this is clean cards guys so don't be expecting any like fake ass bougie cards just appearing i know there's probably going to be some because people are you know still going to be questioning what card they have if it's legit or not and uh most mostly on here you're gonna see legit [ __ ] and i'm interested to see what's legit in oregon washington colorado all that stuff so i feel like these videos they uh show shed light into that you know ever more dark safety but recently learned about reagents and leeches during isomerization and when i understand the only d8 that steak will be extracted from real cannabis to avoid these leftover cans and crusts however these are sold in dispensers possibly because of height delta 9. what method which method to make delta 8 is used to get a real clean stuff and not bathroom chems or is it all blue also i don't care about your favorite brand coa unless you got tests for reagents and bleaches i like you you get it from what i understand the only thing this is the case which method to make d8 it could be clean but they did a lot of lots of cleanup work after the synthesis but not real rn no one test enough for us consumers to know and worse every time so far that brand has been independently tested it variably turns out to be low potency and contaminated to be considered clean synthesized or hemp derived d8 must have safety tests for each and every of the following solvents metals pesticides microbes mycotoxins and reagents and bleaches block to prevent the chills from the dirty pizza from telling you to smoke their dirty deed so disturb spark or whatever i think i mentioned him in the last video he's one of the guys that a lot of people are saying is a douche bag in some sort of way and um he brought up some really good valid points you know obviously d8 has to be safe when it comes out from what i've tried from delta it seems like pretty good you know this is just some stuff maybe that they write to scare people honestly i don't know but uh it is some good stuff that they brought up because obviously you would want your delta eight stuff tested as much as your delta knight and i do see that um but speaking for myself the delta eight brands that i've tried delta eight hemp moon walker serene tree all pretty good i didn't taste any you know chemically ass taste or anything it was just you know some good old distillate and stuff um but then again distillate can be you know iffy as well you know you really can't tell um but just be safe you know just be aware of certain brands and just look out for your own health at the end of the day um like i said this this guy right here that brought up the d8 very good questions but uh i'm gonna have to say that the guy that responded is a moderator of this and he's been known to be like questionable you know what i'm saying like i don't know garlic cookies life hazard ross or live hash rosin cartridge clean pleasant trees that's a [ __ ] nice name liquid trite okay yeah this is only a half gram too it's probably worth so much we're selling for so much real or fake there's the flare right there it says fake and y'all i need help bought this from the weed man and i can't tell if it's there's no lighting and it came in a plastic bag came in a plastic bag come on can i post a picture of a few raw ground cards to help try and verify authenticity and see the community's minions 99.5 percent sure they are real from this message just am super skeptical about cards given my poor health but lemonade lemon pepper from cookies in there not bad yeah i don't [ __ ] with i don't [ __ ] with half gram cartridges or i mean i do but i don't [ __ ] with companies that only sell half gram questions i think that is some [ __ ] [ __ ] and i think that that's their way of saying hey i want your money and i want you to pay for less or get less from it so to be honest anything any company that's still to this day only half grams and are selling it for 60 to 70 for a half gram [ __ ] you washington dispensary anyone tried 30 a gram put in a card in the skittles tastes like grape soda with the hint of wine that's crazy this doesn't taste like great so this is delta eight as well and honestly this is one of the smoothest hitting cartridges that i've tried are none like for distillate usually i'm coughing well most of the time when i'm hitting this is plug play and those those pods and that battery they'd be hitting of course you'll be coughing but this is very a smooth this is a very smooth experience i believe moonwalker is also featured in high times too so i don't know if that brings you some sort of uh clarity but i mean it's it's high time right cheers all right where can i get this tested i know it's fake but i'm curious just about how just i'm just curious to how bad found it on my sister come on bro what the [ __ ] is this 1.1 like what stop solvent free 97 tac like what solvent free or solvent lists and there's a difference right i believe solvent free is no solvents in it at the end product solvent list is extracting without solvents so what that's at best is going to be distillate uh making my own cards terps plus delta e can i mix tears in delhi i want to buy from natural extractions so i've read something about we don't really know how much terpenes we're supposed to be in taking so it's not really good to mix terps homemade you know you don't know the right amount you're not a scientist you know what i'm saying and most of these guys on here aren't scientists as well they ain't going to be able to tell you how much terps and all that stuff to mix delta 8 with so just be careful with that do your research uh i recently just saw that article so it could be like some brand new study or something but it says something about not taking too much or too much terpenes might be a bad thing if uh paraphrase it oil forms around oils from local dispensary here in miami truly i think i've seen truly videos and they're from florida so that should be good i don't know uh the cartridge scene in florida so if if true leaves are fake then just be careful you know what i'm saying you eat raw garlic let's see peanut butter bread sauce never seen this [Music] looks okay that looks so lame with their instagram handle right there on that packaging it looks so crafty looks good west coast cars real or fake no comment i do have some west coast wax though actually no more but did i have some very popular in my state i mean you know a couple people with them obviously improvement there's no branding and everything do you think it's fine because they're getting high i'm not sure i'm just going to pass that anyone recognize this brand as a fake oh sorry it's fake live terpenes delta 9 thc distillate cartridge live terpenes huh not live rising terpenes just live terpenes how do you spot a fake delta eight disposable my buddy runs the smoke to tell me this but there's nothing but the paper and vaping inside come on bro getting from a smoke shop albeit there probably are some delta good delta 8 products and some smoke shops but are you willing to take that risk buying it no like when you can buy it online these people these are the type of people that want it right now they can't wait they can't wait to order online they want to go to a smoke shop and get it they want a little club and get it they want to go to their buddy and get it no patience on these guys really all i have access is to black market but dispensary or so can i put that rsl on but it's working possibly it was probably going to make your butt taste like [ __ ] i bought rso before and i thought it was just regular dab i thought hey you know in a syringe it it was black as [ __ ] i dabbed it it tasted like [ __ ] rso is for the medicinal side rso means rick simpson oil and i guess that's the guy who like popularized it or made it or so so uh you basically use it to to fix your ailments you know what you're smoking on tonight that is the yocan right i believe okay cleaner trash this brand from a local dealer there yet [Music] keep fake carts it's your plug okay i'm gonna end this like if you're getting it from the plug 99 of the chance it's fake you know there's maybe a one percent chance that plug can somehow get it from from the real [ __ ] but come on from the plug from snapchat like really that's gonna be end of this clean carts video hopefully you did enjoy this one i believe this is number four or so let me know in the comments if you did enjoy it let me know if you want a part five and uh like i said like when you comment and leave likes it it motivates me to do more of these and like i said i'm gonna try and get this out today today is tuesday tuesdays i usually go live but i'm thinking that since i'm not going live anymore maybe just do reaction videos on tuesday and maybe on friday as well but or rest it just depends on my mood i guess that day but hopefully you did enjoy this video uh like i said let me know if you want to part five and i'll see you guys in the

trail so in order for your cartridge to work this little paddle on the battery has to come up and make contact with this little paddle on the cartridge alright so as you can see the little paddle on the cartridge side has been recessed so in order to get that paddle back up to the top of the threading we're going to use a little bit of arm spin take the sharp end of the bloom Farms pin to fit in this hole and just raise it up just a little bit very delicately so that it's even with the top of the threading alright so now that we've leveled the paddle off and it's nice and flush with the rings of the threading I'm gonna attach it back to the battery let's give it a shot", "GIXatapwuKc": "it's going on Gus Reaper bees then coming to you today with a kind of a different type of video what I'm going to be doing is I got a fake TKO extract cards I guess as you can see by the title now my original plan was to make this video solely on how to spot the differences and real and fakes two issues with that though when there isn't really not that meaning things to look for it's from me research and like I kind of thought I was gonna be like ningke's a little bit where I could show you four or five different things that you know look forward to help you out but it's TKO it's pretty straightforward to the point I will leave a link to what Realty care cart looks like I am getting a real TKO card he's gonna take about seven days maybe ten to get here Lou tell me five but I will soon so the main thing you want to do is it needs to come in a box and will come in this box with the disposable battery I have a black tip but then like I said this isn't real I'm just saying it will have a black tip and if you're not getting that it the odds of it being real is very very very very slim because they started doing that I believe in May and I'm sure that your ear plugs telling you that he's got a hookup at the source and it's just this continued packaging but they're they're good I'm sure that's what he's telling you if you call him out on it but this is the issue that arises with this I'm trying to keep it pretty simple and not make this video over over complicated or over long but I believe these plugs believe they're plugs you know what I'm saying I believe the people that you your neighborhood plug you're getting these from their plugs by telling them hey I'm under straight from the source in Cali Colorado I know people straight from the company trust me these are hooked up bro they're legit and they probably believe it and it just gets to a point where it's like so many people is convoluted this card game bro it is crazy and it's fairly simple to even I mean I don't know man it's it's crazy out there guys but when it comes to this the price point to something you need to look for if you're getting a car for 20 bucks a pop if you get 10 or 30 bucks a pop if you get however many you get or hell even 40 and you can go to a website and say that those cards are $40 for like a half gram and 60 bucks for a gram 35 for a half gram 64 gram you think you're doing has that much of a connection that he can get you a gram of that same cart for Wax cart for 20 bucks right that's pretty crazy but people believe it and it's like so that's the two main things to look at for these TK is I'm going on a little tangent here but things that come in a box with the disposable pen battery and if you're not paying what it says on a website or a dispensary close to it it's not going to be real I mean but here's the thing this is fake but this is a good fake now there's fake real fakes and black markets this would be fake what I mean by fake is this is what people can buy these packaging online for cents or dollars depending on what brand they get they can fill it with their own oil and they will sell it to you and that's what I mean by fake I'm not counting these people that's putting fake things and to make you think you're getting THC when I say fake I mean I'm counting everything - guys I'm counting the dude that's out here in his garage mixing a half a gram of wax with some liquidiser and selling you some liquidy [ __ ] that's turning round and 15 hits in or it's burning out in 15 hits I'm counting that dude all the way up to these people with dispensaries that's making their own [ __ ] but no man in carts I'm counting from the very bottom of the totem pole up to the very top of the totem totem pole and that's what I mean by fake and that's what's so dangerous about these because you do not know what you're getting until you actually get them now you can do the oil check the oil under the old and then there's ways to trick you and deceive you but so for example this is the card I've been smoking it I have some good things to say about this car don't get me wrong I just want to talk about the fake aspects of everything and what you need to watch out for it so when it gets to the point that you're getting fake cards right you have to and again fake means that it's in a fake companies it's not really from the company someone bought the packaging I don't mean the product inside is fake um the oil is what you have to check for and like I said they can they can mess with that even a little bit to try to deceive you but this one even I've been smoking on this one constantly for 24 over 24 hours and I have smoked other cards so I'm not saying I just only smoke this one got smoke this one pretty heavily and it's hauling down that much now normally if it was not a real legit dispensary card I would be well on half my now so even though this is fake I didn't want to shut the dude out who made it even though I don't know him for saying this dude has some quality all I thought it was gonna be diluted I really did I thought it was gonna be diluted and I was a little upset about that but the chairs by the way no mutt the pool is not amazing it's good but it's not amazing it's like it gets clogged up a little bit I don't I'm not a fan of that but the taste on this guy's whoever tarp this up tarps it up good because I mean the wedding cake flavor is incredible the Sour Diesel is amazing too and but this that just because this one is good and I'm going to tell you guys I don't want to get too far into this and like I said I'm not promoting this I'm just giving you examples of what to look for if you're not 18 21 whatever it is please leave the channel but shares we'll talk about this a little bit because I'm going to tangent now this is like seven minutes and this is Tim long already I don't like the pull of it but the flavor is great the hog is great I mean [ __ ] like I say dumb dang exciting about five six it's these three whoever made these men I don't know who you are you'll never see this but I have to out of good consciousness say props to you bro if everybody that made that made their own all and put them in these carts did it the way you did it my friend we would have no issues but give me a second I'll be right back I want to show you something else boys now I never had an example really before of what those pesticide carts where boys I had them before in the past about thrown away and this was months ago my friend did recently give me an exotic that was all it was black element just showed on the channel but I don't even remember what the [ __ ] I did with it honestly I think I'll [ __ ] I don't know I don't know where it's at so I went out and got another one no I didn't pay for this this is one that my friend gave me he actually made this himself so this is the ones boys that you want to be careful of no and it's not that he really even did a horrible job in making this it's just that he didn't make her up you see how liquidy that is and you see how it's already changing colors and you use liquid wax liquid out there and this is that hot dog water boys it's not going to show up as bad as it actually is on cam I don't think I'm not even going to hit that but and as long as you keep in the card it's not gonna be harmful but now this is what I'm telling you about this is the [ __ ] so if everybody made made the card selected TKOs like I was showing you guys then it really wouldn't be a problem like that you know I'm saying but people make them like this - and it's I need to hit it to get that bubble going to really show you guys I'm not gonna hit it like I said that's just so I don't even know what I did with my decal court now so let's hit this one this is a this is a dank something voice so cheers someone in this video um I'm sorry it was all over the place I wanted to make it is kind of educational as possible on the on the TKO courts but like I said two main factors is and it's coming a box disposable battery and the pricing on it obviously and aside from that I'm we'll be back with some brass knuckles I can show you two guys how to spot brass knuckles I went on that real TKO court to show you guys I also got some other different brands of cards so I really want that familiar with that are coming in that's some reviews on those as well but also hey congrats to mr. and bling see for 1000 subs this one's for you buddy", "-OrePsULJII": "all right what's up everyone it's your boy master bling steve back again with another video today we're gonna be looking at this fake dr. zodiacs clear cart um I'm actually pretty excited to look at this because I've been wanting to get my hands on some dr. zodiacs for a while and even though I got it fake I'm okay with it because I get to show you guys how to tell a real one from a fake one um and I think these are pretty popular so I think this is a video that definitely should be made so stay tuned [Music] alright so before I go any further it seems like there's something missing let me see alright that looks a little bit better I think um I think we're looking a bit more familiar in the new setup so let's continue with the review first off this is fake packaging for dr. zodiacs clear um the dr. zodiacs clear packaging actually looks really dope this looks pretty cool but I'll show you guys were the real packaging looks like right now I reverse up you guys so I was actually no I was actually kind of wrong I was wrong that kind of wrong I was wrong when I was talking about the packaging this is what the Frosty's package looks like let me try to zoom in we can see it better the picture won't get bigger even if I do that it doesn't help but you can see that the package is the same although it does look like it comes with a sticker and it should always come with a battery that being said homie I bought it from could have taken the battery but I still think mine is a fake because it said you better because it has no battery and because it has no sticker um I think if we look up dr. zodiac frosties no not for STIs frosty I cannot spell you look up dr. zodiacs frosty it'll come up with these or like this video and I know Eric Conn did a video on his on them too um but I think the biggest thing that I want to show is a Seattle picture will zoom hopefully it's from lifted and I don't really like trust them as a source usually but can you see how thin that chimney is and how thin that see cell bottom is see cell atomizers always look like this they have a very thin chimney and a sort of fat bottom but not as fat as the one I have um to hold that ceramic coil inside that's why I really think mine's a fake because it's not an actual see cell atomizer and it's pretty easy to just brand any atomizer like another you see it all the time in fakes so yeah let me get back into the actual video now I just wanted to come and show this real quick on this box it says that there's 90 plus percent or 90 percent plus th seeing this upload a pic slash video smoking this product to win merch I don't know why they're encouraging you to flex a faced cart that's kind of [ __ ] up um but you know it has the snow cone clear @dr zodiac on the bottom and this uh california label has it it has snowmen on the side and a California label somewhere out here I know I'm sorry yeah right there California label right on the back above another government warning and frosty snow cone uh the box I'm not really a fan of it feels kind of cheap um obviously whoever had it before me was like [ __ ] with it but that's fine this is the actual cart though it has a snowman on the front and it's a Cecil cart but uh if y'all can see how thick that bar is jesus [ __ ] christ um I will say one good thing about this car or at least the guy I bought this from he was really trying to encourage me to not get this cart he I uh I was talking about he's like yo these cards honestly aren't even that good I have much better stuff are you sure you want this cart I'm like yeah I really want that dr. zodiacs card I didn't tell him I was gonna make a video on it but yeah that's why I wanted it so I could show you guys I'll go ahead and show you guys the bottom of it as you can see it's been leaking a bit so that's also a bit shitty and it says Jupiter C cell and it has a serial number on it so even though it has these three things on the bottom you can see that it has that white Oh ring which also means it's a fake um and again that bar is the biggest telltale sign anyway you know what happens next now I'm gonna actually talk on the cart and tell you guys if it's decent but uh first I'm gonna clean off the bottom so I don't mess up any of my batteries so I'll be back in a second one thing I do want to mention while I'm creating it though there's no air bubble in this cart I can't find one so I'm probably about to make one Cheers [Music] that's really interesting this cart tastes really good it almost tastes sort of like I'm trying a dessert right now if I had to describe it in my own words I would say it's like if cinnamon and nutmeg were made into like a Laffy Taffy flavor then that would be what this tastes like exactly let me take another hit Cheers so I just felt that hate in my soul but it tasted really good I'm already starting to feel a buzz and I'm getting dab sweats but I will say I haven't really smoked all day all I smoked was like 1 bowl so I might just have low tolerance right now Oh either way I'm gonna take one last hit to see if I get like a full-blown high and then I'm gonna check back in tomorrow to give you guys a full rundown of the card so one last time before tomorrow Cheers it takes really good y'all like I'll hit it through a dab cap tomorrow to show you guys how the cloud production is on this card but I'm still not even seeing an air bubble but I'm getting some really nice hits from it so positive opinions of this dr. zodiac card so far and I'll check back in tomorrow see ya all right I'm back what's up so I've spent a whole day night with this cart now and I definitely have some good opinions of it but first off let's take a hit Cheers so first off the biggest thing I'm realizing with this card is that it hits harsh as hell like usually when it comes to some cards when it they're fakes I can still hit them and like still feel sort of smooth hit um let's talk about those TKOs that I just got or even some of the dank vapes they're not as harsh as like this cart is and well sometimes I would think that makes it a real cart because maybe the wax is just hitting me harder the fact that this atomizer is fake it's not a C cell it's a Jupiter which is owned by C cell but it's still not the same kind of atomizer is that dis OD acts use paired with like how much this cart just tastes like flavoring versus actual wheat really really leads me to believe it's a fake which makes sense because like I said homie was really trying to talk me out of getting this cart um the hints are very very harsh my throat kills after taking one and I would say it takes around three to four hits to get high like not even a buzz a full high two hits for a buzz um but that being said the highs on this cart are kind of like weird where you feel sort of creative and talkative and you like I don't know I really just wanted to like play some minecraft or like talk to my sister talk to friends um but I didn't really like feel energized enough to actually like do anything so definitely a perfect night stream but I would not suggest this for a daytime use at all um if you hit the cart a bit too much it will put you right to sleep uh um actually the reason this video is a bit late was because when I was testing this cart this morning it knocked me out for like five hours even though I set my alarm to be able to wake up and film this video on time so I'm sorry about that but yeah overall I would give this car a 7 out of 10 I would say a 7 out of 10 because of how harsh this cart hits and because when compared to other carts that I've had it doesn't feel like it's knocking any of them out the park it just feels a bit above average all on all the biggest unfortunate thing about this car is that it's either average or slightly above average than most of the other carts I've hit and it's below average when it comes to the smoothness when I suggest a fake doctor zodiacs cart I honestly can't really suggest these in good conscience because I don't know if it's hitting harsh because of chemicals that it's cut with or if it's the bad atomizer but either way I don't really trust bad atomizers because I know that sometimes if they use metal coils they can leak chemicals into your wax and then you're just harming yourself each time you take a hit so I wouldn't suggest one of these because of how harsh it is and because I can't personally figure out where that harshness is coming from let's go ahead and sesh I'm gonna be using my broken temper piece I don't remember if I told you all the story but um I had this on one of my cabinets and CJ jumped on top and knocked a plate onto the piece so it broke the stem off and I had to hot glue it back I'm scared to clean this piece so I'm only using it with like carts and abs um because I don't want to mess up the hot glue that I put on it but yeah we're just gonna be using this broken classic piece and Cheers my part was dead or my battery turned off so now Cheers [Music] [Music] cheers again all right let me get my lungs a little second during cover then we'll take another to both side of that hamper pineapple I'm going to take this last cart or dab kappa rip through the paint can i got from daily high club so cheers [Music] I'm gonna give this card a little bit of time to reset and then I'll take a blinker and that'll be the end of the video before I take the blinker though I just want to say thank you for watching if you made it this far please like and subscribe leave a comment if you think that this is a fake or a real card because honestly I'm having a lot of trouble trying to figure it out for sure I think it's a fake because of how thick the chimney is the harshness of it and the flavoring but unfortunately I haven't had first experience with one of these so if you're watching this and you have please let me know if your experience sums along the lines of mine or if you've had a different one either way I'm master blinky thank you for watching this video I appreciate it and I'll catch y'all later [Music] [Music]", "97dzlqMq9u4": "welcome to another episode of stay high stay humble podcast you support on let's go man back with another review today I'll be reviewing the fat cause either starburst now the starburst is a strain we mix it between the DJ's shorts blueberry and headbang says that it is a hybrid so yeah and I will be reviewing a new battery I have that's called the be mine so basically just a battery for any 510 thread cart it's like I said I'll be reviewing the fat cloud Z so just like any other battery click it five times to turn it on and off five and now us off you see and then you click five times and turn it on one two three four five that's what it does then you know two three clicks to change the [ __ ] I'm going to see the green is the lowest setting on their yellow is a middle setting and red is the third setting so that's the study that I use to keep it on usually keep it on the highest setting when it comes to any battery that I'm using and when I'm vaping the carts so like I said I believe reviewing the starburst so basically I already took a couple of hits before I start the video and something you may be able to tell but I'm pretty pretty high this is the shrub the starburst range I think it's called the pink starburst Oh so they said it's a hybrid definitely definitely do get that sweet taste you also get up Heine taste more so sweet yeah with the new fat clouds carts they have like an adjuster on their so basically you control the airflow so right now I got it turn it's like it's shown three circles and if you keep turning it you know the circles go away so use the if is showing no circles that's like the hardest pool and I like it you know set that way with like you know the hardest pool cuz on a more open setting went through circles Sean it was like I had a smoother airflow but the hips wasn't as strong you know I didn't really need you know was a coffin as much so if you don't you know want coffee as much and you don't you know you want to either airflow I would put it on that setting but I prefer the setting where it's like showing those circles and stronger airflow something let me see preheat it and take a hit definitely definitely hits this tastes great high is great any kartli I usually bake for fat cloudy as always you know tasting great or it tastes like that strain of weed and highest consistent you know each time you you know you're vaping it because you know with other carts it may be like you know weaker high and high don't last as long but look fat cloudy I say it last ones like iron it has the two hours and all it takes is a couple hits you know one or two hits here good so yeah it's definitely definitely uh Phil Annette and I definitely like the battery it shows you how much how much all you have left even though it's you know sticking out at the top I wish it was like a little bit taller so it cover more of the cart but you know definitely definitely like and I definitely like the design of it put it right in your pockets whether you're headed to the movies they add to the grocery store local corner store don't matter you know you can take it with you as discreet take a couple of hits it's not gonna smell like anything it's nothing I like about you know the carts yeah yeah definitely definitely liking this train to me feels more of an indica I know it's like a hybrid mix between the sativa and indica but it definitely definitely feel like that little more of an indica body high not much as a head high but definitely definitely a body high it feels great it definitely definitely like this battery uh and I definitely like the carp more verses like the older carts I'm going to take out another one show you the difference so this is like the order cart and this is a newer car so you kind of you know see the difference take the bottom piece off of this one and you can definitely you know tell you know the difference between the two we are definitely like that she can control the airflow and a newer one versus the older one is just you know a regular cart most people didn't like that it was like always a harder pool so I would definitely definitely you know say if you have a tri-five cloudy yet definitely pick them up and you know if you have tried them definitely you would definitely enjoy like the newer cart better and there's you know better design better air flow that you control so yeah yeah that's my review of the starburst with black clouds even if you enjoyed the video give me a thumbs up man if you want to see more definitely subscribe stay tuned and remember stay high stay humble these", "wsAsnr5n37o": "[Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] oh hi welcome to community cannabis kitchen so um i'm just gonna insert the video of this up close in the beginning of this not doing enter or anything um so here you have a full spectrum cannabis extract or full what is it full extract cannabis oil uh it's another term for it you can see the color on that i believe this is pretty much the same thing as rick simpson oil or phoenix tears but essentially they're moving away from those terms probably because it's named after someone who i'm pretty sure tried to make a business out of that or is trying to still um and what you have here is a full spectrum terpenes and everything it's strange specific um you got all that and it's fully activated already this i could eat this right now and it would i would feel it so no baking or anything needed so there's a lot of ways to consume this um i personally use oblate discs as they're called salsa use these for kratom um there are little i'll show you a little cellulose discs just like that and you they dissolve so you can wrap stuff up real easily i take anything i need to take as a pill just wrap it up like that if it's not a pill already of course um so yeah i'm going to ingest some of that with dinner and then i will make a second video or yeah no i will probably link it to this video and cut it all together but i will let you know how this feels because i've been trying out um mostly reclaim and i did i i ate reclaimed twice and then i tried de-carving some live resin or sugar wax and live resin rather and ate that and felt a slight difference but figured go big or go home try it properly with the full extract cannabis oil so i'll let you know what i think of that once i try it out all right um updating with the effects it's been um [Music] like 45 minutes to an hour actually it says on here activation time 60 minutes which i've never found that to be the case the edibles the um it's even de-carving the live resin the other day that hit me legit within i swear like 15 minutes on an empty stomach which this was on the empty stomach that's probably part of it uh no i feel a like a much more wide effect like more um i would describe it like the way that distillate carts feel to live resin how they feel kind of two-dimensional and all that sort of stuff this stuff definitely feels like a lot more i mean full spectrum that's i guess kind of the whole point of its full spectrum edible cannabis extract uh i'm pretty stoned i don't i don't know what to say very good stuff though i will say um that's the only brand i've tried so i can't really compare it to anything but it's really really good way better than just reclaim so yeah i'll show you that um one more time i had it says serving size .01g um they're supposed to be 100 servings per container which is for new new people because i think the dose here is 5 milligrams um i took i have a huge tolerance to begin with so i was taking like .75 to almost a gram of reclaim it took me uh i took a third of this so it's 333 milligrams of the oil and i don't know what that would work out to with 81.95 thc but it doesn't take nearly as much i know that so cannabinoid content certainly a lot better than just reclaiming such um all in all i really really liked the packaging of this versus the packaging of the only other brand i think the sis q sudden or something like that [ __ ] q herbals or something like that something from the town of the city of sisaku um they just had like a thc and a cbd one this one has strange specific ones like mango kush across the strawberry koapa which is the strain specifically so um yeah good stuff good stuff um i think that's all i've got to say about it um i like edibles now that's another thing too so thanks for watching like and subscribe and i hope these help you with your hunt for your products", "89BV6rVYOBI": "and what's gonna be J it was good for us good bro what it's good faded family so you guys today I'm back with two

last time I've ever felt like this it it feels like drugs I know it's still kind of early I don't know what I'm doing I feel like I just want to go home right now but um yeah I'm tapping with you guys soon I feel like I'm flying right now you guys I'm only going 40 I'm so high so that felt so [ __ ] crazy I feel like I'm gonna die with this guy's driving right now it's not gonna drink the rest of this I hate the surfing bottom as a [ __ ] worst just trying to race right now damn I don't know about you guys the edibles to me feels like absolute [ __ ] tap I don't know why anybody takes them definitely not for fun I mean if I was feeling sick and I couldn't smoke or if I was an edible type of person I probably was just do it in moderation I would never do anything to it what I took today was 44 doses so pretty much one bottle is 22 servings when I ended up taking less 44 servings today you guys and I'm just feeling the effects of the first bottle right now so I feel like the second ball is still gonna hit me and I'm just gonna be floored we're on our way right now back to my pad we're about to run some 2k you know we've gotta go to Chipotle guys I'm hungry as [ __ ] right now when I get high as [ __ ] I need something to bring me back before this like super smacks me down and I knocked the [ __ ] out but anyways far away from up in 2k we go Chipotle will you bite get bro

way to go I almost felt like throwing up it's crazy I haven't thrown up from canvas probably since high school but today I came pretty close to it but after having probably like five or six bites of the burrito I'm definitely feeling better my stomach's starting to settle down the thing is this morning before I even did this challenge you guys I made sure I had a good breakfast how many sure I was hydrated cuz last time I was a hydrated so this time I didn't have a headache but hey you guys I'm just gonna have more of my burrito you know restore some of my body because what's happening right now is I just barely finished the other thousand milligrams so it's about to start to hit my body in the next 15 to 20 minutes I mean I'm already feeling the effects from that first bottle the first dozen milligrams and then I'm gonna start to feel the effects from the next thousand milligram damn you guys even that burrito couldn't save me this time joy ass up bro bro what the [ __ ] did

weird sticky film around my mouth that just never goes away I personally don't drink normal lean so I don't know if that occurs with like actual syrup like that but this syrup in particular [ __ ] really got me you guys I don't know if you could tell by my eyes but I'm having trouble keeping my eyes open they feel really dry I honestly don't remember the last time I was this I honestly I mean I might have said it in my last video I must say it again is not fun being this high you guys I do not recommend it but I'm probably gonna cut this video out right now it's arty I think I need to take a nap I might end up updating you guys one last time once I wake up if you enjoy this video drop a like drop a comment down below subscribe to your boy you guys aren't subscribed I'll see you guys soon", "MljAks08IKk": "so today i'm going to be doing two it's really one review of one product but two separate strains of the product it is going to be quality control thc and these are drops they're tinctures it says on here terps i don't know why they're calling them terps [Music] but this one is i got maui wowie and i have golden pineapple now the golden pineapple is a hybrid the maui is a sativa and the maui wowie i prefer the maui over the golden pineapple this is something the maui the sativa is something you're going to want to take during pretty much during the day later on in the evening and this is something that you probably would take later in the evening closer to not i'm not really a fan of i'm not a fan of anticas or indica dominant strains i like the uplifting and relaxing feeling not the stoned out of your mind feeling um this the maui is amazing i was taking these i got to get another bottle i ran out of the maui but i was taking one about a little drop i'll show you how much you should take you want to take it about i took it sorry taking about an hour after i woke up and then after that son of a [ __ ] it shows you the recommended dose on here i can't even get this [ __ ] open with one hand the recommended dose is like a fourth of the dropper that's pretty much what i stuck with it takes about 30 minutes to kick in and with the maui you will notice a calming uplifting feeling now the golden pineapple i think it's more of a anthic dominant it feels that way anyway so you take it and about again about 30 minutes you feel it but it it it's more of a couch like type of feeling for me and i do not like that they have grape ape i was gonna get grape eight but it's a pure indica and i can't i'm not even gonna [ __ ] with it but 100 would highly recommend this because i'm going to tell you some of the the great benefits of it for me is i noticed that people that normally got on my nerves didn't get on my nerves as much whenever i was whenever i had that in my system so i was able to be around people where i was not in my head as much meaning i wasn't like over analyzing every little thing that was happening or that did happen or that could happen and i was just able to i guess step back and enjoy things more now uh another pleasant side effect of this is it does not this is going to sound odd to say but it it kind of it kind of decreases your appetite i have noticed like it doesn't give you much use it doesn't it even makes you not spill hungry and another bro amazing side effect for me for me was it i'll take kratom i have kratom reviews coming up and i was taking too much credit my thought i still think i was because i was taking like an ounce to an ounce and a half a day and now once i started taking this i was able to get a three ounce bag to last me like five six days so we cut my kratom usage in half so i'm definitely going to pick up the um i'm definitely going to grab more of the maui wowie definitely going to grab more than maui now the golden pineapple i still have [ __ ] i still have about three fourths of a bottle left with this so i am going to use that before i get more maui and i do want to say these retailed for 29.99 30 even at my local dispensary or botanical shop i have noticed uh with a lot of these products that you can order them offline for cheaper as opposed to going into your local dispensary or botanical shop the only issue with that is by the time you wait for it and you cover shipping you're paying about the same price unless you get a large quantity so just ordering one of these offline if you don't have them in your area go ahead and order them offline because you'll pay the same price as you if you walked into your local dispensary slash botanical shop but if you get a high quality of things definitely definitely order online or look around your area to try to find better deals because uh i have something that i'm going to going to get today that i'm going to review and talk about how i ended up switching dispensaries botanical shops then i had to drive an extra 20 minutes but the price the quality the uh just the friendliness i guess you could say of this place drew me there i still [ __ ] with a shout out to advanced botanicals still [ __ ] with those guys uh but this new shot man uh hook i mean they hook you up they're super chill super nice they give you samples they uh will mix [ __ ] up for you they will make i mean it's just amazing so today i'm going to get a kilo of white elephant white endo and white hulu mixed and then i'm getting some delta 10 thc which i'm going to review on here probably in the upcoming days i'm planning on getting the delta 10 cart and then i'm getting the cookies cart delta 8 cart it's it's a knockoff cookies it looks slack to me it's called cake i think or something like that i have to do a little bit more research on that but i've tried it from a friend and it was amazing so my my last um final say on this is it is wonderful definitely get it definitely check it out it's kind of like for micro dosing something to help you micro dose so you're not taking huge uh so let's just say you've got an edible and you want a micro dose and edible it's hard to it's hard to get an exact dosage unless you get ones that are you know like 25 or 15 milligrams per cube or per gummy and even then um you might take it and wait 45 minutes and not feel anything then you take a half of one and then they kick in together and you're you're you're you're done for the day or maybe the next two days edibles are hard to micro dose these are extremely easy to micro dose so if you're interested in micro dosing check them out it will give you a calm but uplifted relaxed feeling um that's all i'm going to say about it highly recommend we're going to do five stars here what i think of it and i'm gonna rate this a solid four stars this product quality control carts delta eight thc so definitely go check them out it is worth it and also guys i i'm extremely excited about this because you i have a ridiculous amount of delta 8 delta 9 soon to be delta 10 products i have a ridiculous amount of like cart of um pan reviews of box reviews of kratom reviews different kinds of kratom so please stay tuned i have psychedelic videos coming soon back and i'm also going to continue to talk about the reality as it is so hope you guys stay tuned for all that it's game of form in the play of life i am you talking to you love you guys", "xQexZcgxxYM": "alright guys so basically fake carts are pretty bad for you okay [ __ ] but we've been knew that okay yeah but they're also harmful for your lungs though okay yeah and I've been knew that too alright [ __ ] did you know that they're actually killing people now well no more did you know that 60 to 70 percent of black market carts are contaminated with a chemical that no one should actually be inhaling I mean nah I didn't know that either but like or that as of September 11 2019 450 cases of pulmonary disease have been attributed to the use of black market carts yeah I bet you didn't know that I bet you also didn't know that there are now six deaths that are reported as a result of these carts so just go ahead sit down and watch this video because I'm gonna be talking about some important [ __ ] in it so yeah roll the [ __ ] intro alright fine so why is blinks he's sitting in his hot ass room a 90 degree weather yelling about why you guys shouldn't use fake cards well first off I do want to say that I personally have stopped really using them I don't hit them unless I like have to do a review of them and then I'll either throw them out or give them away with the warning that I don't want to use this myself I hope you don't use it but you know some people just don't care anyway I know that fake hearts have been affecting me I can feel it oh now that I've stopped really using them and I really just smoked lead and abs at this point I've gotten so much better being able to take hits of weed before quitting cards I couldn't even hit weed you all have seen it on this channel it's been held for me oh and I always thought that it was just weed itself that was messing with me so I thought oh maybe hearts are better oh but after quitting them or at least not using them as heavenly as I used to I have noticed such improvement with my own lungs oh it's great honestly once I gave Princess crying so anyway first off I do want to talk about all the vitamin E acetate stuff that has been going around the internet lately I went through a lot of websites did a lot of research took a lot of notes so I'm just gonna try to get my best to explain to you guys in terms I was able to understand I'm not gonna be talking down to y'all because I know you are intelligent and I just want to be honest with you guys from my own experience because that's what this whole channel is based off is my experiences with things and my opinion though so anyway let's actually get into this so first off what is vitamin E acetate vitamin E acetate is a diluting agent that's usually used for very heavy oils such as THC wax but the thing about vitamin E II acetate is that it started out and was mainly used for cosmetic purposes for like soaps and topical ointments and [ __ ] ever since 2000 actually people have been saying that they've been inhaling it and getting sick from it people put topicals around their nose and after inhaling all the fumes they were getting what is called the BOE pneumonia that's what's showing up again with the people who are smoking these fake cards 5 people in North Carolina were actually found to have lippy white pneumonia which is when fat from oils gets into your lungs and gets stuck there the way that's happening is the fact that vitamin E acetate is an oil that is never supposed to be inhaled but why do we as donors have to worry about vitamin E acetate the reason we have to wear is because the people who supply cards to our black market they're really just trying to make the most money they can obviously it's a business it's a very booming business so people are gonna be trying to make money any way they can it's sort of throwing our health away because they don't care we're just dollar signs to them your plug might may or may not care about you but half the time your plug isn't even making the cart see selling you you know when you're buying these carts that have this vitamin e acetate in them and you are inhaling them you're inhaling stuff that you're not supposed to inhale you're inhaling oils that are not supposed to be in your lungs if people got sick from inhaling it through their nose imagine us who are actually just taking the [ __ ] to our lungs and exhaling it again it's terrible for you what's very very unfortunate is that three of the biggest manufacturers of diluting agent sport arts have been found to have high amounts of despite of mini acetate stuff in there diluting agents and it's even said from them that around sixty to seventy percent or fifty million carts on the black market probably have this chemical in them that we're not inhale that's a big reason why everyone you see on YouTube on Instagram like even in legal states is telling you do not buy cars from black market only buy them from license dispensaries the reason they do that is because license manufacturers can only sell to license dispensaries and delivery services if you're buying on black market you have no idea what you're actually getting and it could really be anything [Music] all right that there we go brand-new hey you hey you you prepubescent teenage boy you wanna buy some drugs oh yeah yeah you you you want to buy a clerk yeah buy a car what's in it what strain oh it's so asparagus oh gee you is that good shoes from Cali merica I get my ship [ __ ] I get my [ __ ] ship from Cali bro all straight all straight good [ __ ] good quality Cali cards all [ __ ] like like people be saying like yo yo yo [ __ ] fake but I'll be like nah sorry [ __ ] from Cali like I'm telling you man it's called good I won't hit it myself believe you want to hit it go for it oh that sounds dope how much yeah so because that car is a high quality in from Cali I'm gonna be charging you around like 80 bucks for it that's just how much it is like that's a good price I promise is from Kathy okay $50 I have that I saved up like three weeks oh dang alright here's your cut whoa a cart [Music] oh [ __ ] where's a little okay I guess so the fact that we're buying these cards because we either have no choice which is my still own problem like I still cannot get legit carts anywhere so I have to still buy black-market I know it's that way with a lot of you guys if you're watching this video and even if it's not and you live in a legal state I would implore you to actually start trying to go to dispensaries and buying hurts it your health is worth the extra markup um and you at that point have an opportunity that a lot of us do not so just take advantage of it you know so a big thing I'm seeing in the news is that in New York Governor Andrew Cuomo just grouped ecigs and THC vapes into one a nice trying to ban flavor vapes for everyone I think that is probably one of the dumbest decisions ever and just pretty much shows how out of touch politicians can be when it comes to black market cannabis or just cannabis in general faint juice itself is not something that you really have to worry about so it upsets me that they're grouping ecigs and eliquid with THC vape and THC concentrates because we're not getting the help that we need when it comes to regulation that way they're just trying to ban a bunch of stuff under a big umbrella instead of looking at the actual problem and trying to fix it but the biggest problem is is that cannabis isn't legal for everyone so it cannot be regulated it's hard to [ __ ] regulate the cannabis market because there are no government standards for it legal states have created their own standards and they're trying their best but for the rest of the country who wants to partake in this medicine it's hard for us to try to figure out what's safe what's not safe what's convenient what's not convenient what's legal and illegal it's a lot to have to worry about so it's a big reason I understand why carts are as popular as they are they're convenient they don't smell they're easy to hide there's so many benefits to them it's a real shame honestly that the whole market is getting flooded with this terrible [ __ ] as I said in my intro as of September 11th when I wrote all of my notes and the day before I'm recording this 450 cases of pulmonary disease which is lung disease tied to these black-market carts and six deaths I'm seeing a lot of memes about like people are getting all up in arms about lay six deaths from vaping but I don't really think they understand the severity of it where it's not just six people died from vaping it's six people dying from a market that is flooded with poison at this point a lot of reason why people including me are now saying don't smoke fake hearts it's just because we want you guys to be safe that's all as a youtuber I feel like it is my job to give you guys what is an educated opinion and to steer you guys in the right direction I do my best to do that and I don't want any of you guys to get hurt because I care about every one of you who are watching this video even if I don't know you personally I still care about you as a fellow as a fellow stoner or just a fellow enthusiast for cannabis you know so the three companies that are the biggest perpetrators in this whole situation are Hunnicutt uber thick and pure diluting I tried to look up all of these companies to find any information on them Hunnicutt seems like it's been used because I can't find anything on it except for on eBay here and I Luton as well I can't really find a lot of stuff on these are all used in our black market carts and they're all very bad for you and as I said 60 to 70 percent of all of our carts have this [ __ ] in them all of these companies have been offered have been served subpoenas which means they're all under investigation right now and of all of the cards that the CDC has been testing now um I think they have of around a thousand samples but 10 out of the first 18 that they tested have come back with this vitamin e acetate in them I've personally really stopped using fake cards I'm about to show you why but I'll explain it real quick I tried doing that 100 hits challenge for my 2,000 subscribers special it was gonna be something I was really excited about I got around 90 hits in I'm not even gonna front oh I ended up losing like 20 hits of footage but I scrapped the video and have all of the footage on my computer still a big reason why I stopped hearts after that challenge was because I threw up nine times oh I smoked three different cards and I smoked weed during that challenge out of those three cards I Green nine times of those nine times two times were from a doctor zodiac spake part and seven times I green because I was smoking on a damn list card it was a strawberry Devils curry and even in the video I went back and watched my review of it and wondered why I gave it a 7 out of 10 I am kicking myself for that review I almost want to delete it because I do not suggest that buzz anymore I don't [ __ ] with them I do not take them oh I have a review coming out of them next Monday where I even say I don't like them anymore oh but i'ma show you guys the footage of this because for me I think cannabis should make you feel happy it should make you feel comfortable it should just make you feel good and at one point during that challenge I literally was sitting down and just thought I feel disgusting I do not want to continue this and I hate the fact that cannabis made me feel that way and I don't want anyone else to have to feel that way because of cannabis because I think it is so important oh I think Andrew Cuomo is a [ __ ] jackass for grouping eliquid and a THC liquid together because this is a very real problem and trying to attack joules and [ __ ] again is not gonna save any of us Oh so if you guys are okay with seeing a bit of gross Ness I'm going to show you guys probably the worst parts of that challenge so you guys can know why I'm telling you to please stop smoking cards but if you're still not convinced after that I can't really change your opinion you know but either way let's get into that alright so Loki another reason I want to do this challenge is because I really don't know if hitting fake hearts this often is very very harmful I'm gonna find out um before you all are in my comments saying blink see why the [ __ ] are you smoking fake cards do you not care about yourself honestly no but hear me out I smoked around probably 20 hits every time I'm just like recording a video um I know I don't show all of the hits but like while I'm recording that's a lot of hits or if I'm like making gameplay videos I'll hit this thing around 20 times anyway so I'm used to smoking this much it's not really gonna like kill me or anything I don't think but um this is sort of like a live excites experiment for real we're gonna find out if fake arts are terrible for you I think this one is bad I really don't like hitting this car I might actually not hit it much more depending on how it makes me feel so I will have to waste a lot of that live card but for now we're just gonna soldier on with this [Music] [Music] I have a fake card I have a bunch of fake hearts what do I do with them um I mean I can show you what I would do with the cards right now actually let's go do that alright so the gag took a bit longer than I really expected it to but uh basically I'm about to just run over all these fake cards so yeah let me go ahead and do that I just I feel like it'd look cool [Music] can I just say I ran over these [ __ ] around three four times and this one is still okay I think this one is yeah [ __ ] dab what is still okay and this other dank babes still okay so uh I think I'm gonna end up running over these ones again but uh yeah these ones broke so that that made the guy work a little bit let's try and see if I can get these ones to break - [ __ ] these carts alright so now we're doing it take two of running over these carts again [ __ ] fake cards and let's do it alright it's a fun story my family came outside to ask me why I was just backing up and then going for you get in our driveway I explained to them that I was saying [ __ ] fake carts and I don't really think they understood me so that's awkward but anyway let's get back inside alright you guys so after everything in this video what do I want you guys to take away from it basically if you live in a legal state please start buying your carts only from dispensaries or licensed delivery services weed Maps is a sort of good source because it'll at least give you the names of dispensaries in your area and then you can use your judgement or there are a few signs to look for when it comes to looking at legit dispensaries I'll go over that in a future video but if you live in a legal state please start buying your carts from dispensaries not black-market oh I don't really care about whatever else you buy from the black market but for carts especially do not buy them from black market anymore if you have if you live in an illegal state and you have to buy from black market then there are still some carts that will probably be safer for you than others but my best advice to you would be if you can switch from carts to something else do that because it's really not the risk carts will probably just eventually start being okay again but as of right now they are definitely not safe for you um if you're still gonna be smoking cards either way of course I'm still gonna be making reviews on carts oh I don't really suggest carts right now especially like i said 'dad woods I really really have a vendetta against them though um but I don't really suggest carts anymore but I am still going to be trying to do some sort of reviews of them because I do know that there still is gonna be a big amount of my audience that doesn't live in legal states and has to get these oh but I am gonna personally start switching more to just wheat and dads and I would implore you guys to do the same some things I did want to go over a quick that I sort of forgot to earlier um one is that vitamin E acetate is actually illegal to be used in substances that are to be inhaled in some states but in all of the West Coast states for some reason it's still not regulated um that's probably gonna be a law that they passed soon but it is definitely something that I wish was passed sooner because a lot of what is flooding the black markets are coming from west coast since West Coast is so huge in cannabis in general oh I also do want to say that one death was from someone who bought vapes from a dispensary which is why I'm saying only go to licensed dispensaries there are a license and unlicensed dispensaries and pretty much every legal state um and you can really really tell which ones are like more which ones are licenses which ones are a bit more shady um stay away from the shady ones only because I don't want you guys to get hurt Oh so yeah moving forward I think those are the things that are gonna be able to keep us the most safe um I hope you enjoyed this

whole topic because I am curious about what you guys's thoughts are on it I had a lot of people asking me what cards I think are safe and which ones aren't um I'll just give you a quick list right now as far as cards that I personally think might be a bit safer I would say the black tip TKOs I've been having really good experience with those lately on live East Coast I've had also good experiences with elite meds I had a good experiences with unfortunately that's pretty much it so even still I wouldn't really go out of your way to go buy black market carts but if you are living in black market States or if you aren't living in black market states where you don't have a medical card oh then those would be the brands that I haven't found any effects of my on myself I'll catch you guys on I'll catch you guys tomorrow actually with some scary games I hope you guys will come through that but either way thank you guys for watching and I'll see you all later peace [Music]", "g4tHSckLfGk":

never they didn't send me this like i paid for this with my own money uh and i gotta say it's definitely uh blowing my expectations away i would say that i'm pretty picky when it comes to like uh delta you know cards and edibles and disposables uh and this one definitely um almost i would say that it's just like a regular delta nine card because it gets me pretty [ __ ] baked so speaking of that let's go ahead take a hit off this this is what it looks like man very sleek like you know they really did a good job with the packaging the brand the way it looks they tried to go for the cookies look i kind of see so i respect it but they'll never hold up to cookies in my opinion but i definitely wish them the best obviously but cheers boys we're going to take off this i have to be careful not to hit this too much too big because um delta really makes me cough i don't know if that happens to you guys but it makes me cough my [ __ ] head off um do let me know what you guys are

nice you can scan here to see like all the [ __ ] that you need to know like i said i really love the packaging i love what they did here like i just think they did a really good job and it like i said it's lemon kush it definitely tastes like lemon man and with just a little bit of like kush terps honestly men they definitely got that flavor down to a science uh and you can see on the side it uh shows how much juice you have left which i really appreciate um because you never know when it's actually done until you start like tasting a burger hand but you're at least gonna know we're um they have obviously a bunch of other flavors i just picked this one because i was pretty much put on the spot with it and rush and anytime i'm usually put on this whenever i like buy something if they're like you want this one i'm like sure um but i would almost be willing to try another flavor man um if this video you know let's try to get 40 likes man if this video gets 40 likes i'll that'll let me know that you guys still want to see more delta videos more delta reviews um yeah i'm already getting kind of high off this man it's not like obviously like a delta 900 it's not like super psychoactive uh but it is very calming and very relaxing and my body feels really like just chill my eyes feel really good it is an indica so i mean but let's go ahead and keep taking some hits man let's get [ __ ] high [ __ ] on this okay [Music] and let me know in the comments man um me and my girlfriend do a lot of hikes and stuff during um the summer let me know if you guys want to see any

products that you think that i would maybe like or that maybe you'd want to see me try maybe i could pick it up with somebody or you know we'll see but uh let's just keep it in this man [Music] so seriously though i mean this disposable actually does get me high compared to where the other one i had was not really that good and i'm a big fan i'm a sucker for disposable stuff like i said um so i definitely would say this is the best disposable delta a pod or delta pen that i've had disposable um love the packaging love everything about it love the taste my girlfriend really likes this she even has been spoken on this a lot and says it really gets her to the you know that right high that she wants so yeah i mean i'm not sponsored i'm not telling you to buy it i'm just telling you that this is a good brand if you are looking for disposable pots it has a light down here to let you know like uh that you're hitting it i don't know if you could take a blinker on it i tried it when i first got it in the other video and i literally coughed for 10 minutes so i'm not really trying to do that again it also has a k right here i don't really know what that means but [Music] i mean it still looks really cool uh yeah man i mean i don't really have much else to say about this this gets the job done you will get high smokiness um well i can't fully say that you will i do and i feel like it would definitely get most people high because i spent a lot of time tonight um it's a heavy hitter tastes great great packaging i think you can buy them for like 30 bucks maybe 30 bucks online
