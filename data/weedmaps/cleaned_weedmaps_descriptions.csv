2,rainbow-jones,"Durban Poison has deep roots in the Sativa landrace gene pool. The strain’s historic phenotypes were first noticed in the late 1970s by one of America’s first International strain hunters, Ed Rosenthal. According to cultivation legend, Rosenthal was in South Africa in search of new genetics and ran across a fast flowering strain in the port city of Durban. After arriving home in the U.S., Rosenthal conducted his own selective breeding process on his recently imported seeds, then begin sharing. Rosenthal gave Mel Frank some of his new South African seeds, and the rest was cannabis history. Frank, who wrote the “Marijuana Grower’s Guide Deluxe"" in 1978, modified the gene pool to increase resin content and decrease the flowering time. In search of a short-season varietal that could hit full maturation on the U.S. East Coast, Frank’s crossbreeding efforts resulted in two distinct phenotypes, the “A” line and “B” line. The plant from Frank’s “A” line became today’s Durban Poison, while the “B” line was handed off to Amsterdam breeder David Watson, also known as “Sam the Skunkman.” Durban Poison has a dense, compact bud structure that’s typical of landrace Indica varieties, but the flowers’ elongated and conical shape is more characteristic of a Sativa. When cultivated indoors or in a greenhouse, Durban Poison needs ample room for the production of side branches. Cultivating Durban Poison outside provides an opportunity for this plant to reach its greatest potential. Regardless of whether cultivated indoors or outdoors, Durban Poison requires thorough trellising to support its ample flower production. Regular and feminized Durban Poison seeds are available through the Dutch Passion Seed Company. Durban Poison won 2nd place in 2013 and 2014 at the Denver High Times Cannabis Cup in the Medical Sativa category."

Also known as Larry Bird, Gelato (#33) was first cultivated in Northern California's Bay Area and is derived from a deep bank of genetics created by the Cookie Family, the Sherbinskis family, and cultivator Mario Guzman. The cultivators parted ways following its creation, and the cultivator who possesses the most “stable version” of Gelato genetics is up for debate. Cookies cultivates a few phenotypes and descendants of the strain named Gelato #42, Dolce Gelato, and a sun-grown Gelato. Sherbinskis grows four stabilized Gelato phenotypes in its rotation as well: Gelato #41 (Bacio Gelato), Gelato #43 (Gello Gelato), Gelato #47 (Mochi Gelato), and Gelato #49 (Acai Berry Gelato). Per Sherbinskis, the #33 phenotype is no longer in cultivation. The strain is considered a challenge to grow, and each phenotype expresses different growth characteristics. Indoors, it produces relatively short plants with dark, magenta buds that typically mature within 8-9 weeks of entering the 12/12 flowering cycle. Outdoor growers can expect Gelato to reach maturity by mid-October in the Northern Hemisphere, and mid-March in the Southern Hemisphere. Because its seeds aren’t commercially available, potential growers must find certified Gelato clones from Cookies to propagate it. Sherbinksis does not sell clones or seeds of its Gelato phenotypes at this time."

Online sources trace its beginnings to the 1970s, when Santa Cruz breeders known as the Haze Brothers cultivated Sativa seeds from friend, fellow grower and neighbor David Watson, also known as Sam the Skunkman. The brothers combined a landrace Mexican Sativa with a landrace Colombian strain. From there, the best females were selected and then crossed with a southern Indian landrace strain. Finally, the brothers crossed the resulting hybrid with a Thai landrace male to create what’s known as Haze. Sam the Skunkman took several of the brothers' Haze seeds to the Netherlands, where he sold the genetics under the name Cultivator’s Choice. Breeders loved the strain’s uplifting qualities and stability so much that it soon became the genetic backbone for many famous phenotypes and hybrids, including Neville’s Haze, Amnesia Haze, Purple Haze, and many more cultivars that won Cannabis Cups.

Origin #1 The clone-only version of Cat Piss was derived from a select phenotype of Super Silver Haze. Her flowers are rock-hard and shaped like a small pine cone with a glowing neon-green hue. Cat Piss has shades of dark green and lavender that will remind you of a tropical jungle. Her flowers are littered with long, deep, amber-colored hairs with a thick resin coating. When cultivated indoors, Cat Piss typically completes a flowering cycle within 65 days of the 12/12 light cycle switch. As a Sativa-dominant clone, this strain responds well to low-stress training (LST). When grown in a Screen of Green (SCROG) environment, cultivators will witness an increase in vegetation and ultimately higher yields. Cat Piss thrives in both indoor and outdoor grow environments and is known to produce moderate yields when left untrained. The flavors are spiced with an ammonia nose, and the effect works well at managing stress and depression. Note: In cannabis folklore, Cat Piss has two other origin stories. SoCal Cat Piss was derived from the famed TrainWreck strain, while NorCal Cat Piss is thought to be related to an Afghani landrace. Origin #2 SoCal Cat Piss (Catpiss) is a Sativa-dominant clone-only strain that was purportedly derived from the Trainwreck strain. This version of Cat Piss has an Indica plant structure and growth pattern that produces a shorter plant with a skunky essence. SoCal Cat Piss is known for its abundant yields and its medicinal effects. Origin #3 NorCal Cat Piss is an Indica-leaning clone only strain that was tracked down and saved by Shabud, a well-known member of the online forum community Overgrow.com. As the story goes, Norcal Cat Piss inspired Shabud’s early growing career and he spent the next 15 years looking for the strain.

88,master-yoda,"It took 10 years to perfect the lemon-berry/sour grape-taste of Querkle — a cross of a female Purple Urkle cut with pollen from a Space Queen cut — according to seed bank TGA Genetics. TGA co-founder Subcool initially bred the strain in a 4-by-6-foot closet in Oregon a decade ago after obtaining an exceptional Purple Urkle clone from a grower named Sticky Lungs. The goal with Querkle, as Subcool tells it, was to capsulize a purple Indica hybrid into seed form that could be used to create a purple line. At the time, he was working with several other purple clones -- including Mendocino Purps, GDP and Purple Skunk -- but preferred the Purple Urkle cut. Subcool bred Querkle to replicate the mother’s Purple Urkle grape flavor while speeding growth by adding a Space Queen male. Of five resulting phenotypes, TGA kept two for their medium-to-heavy yields, distinctive grape flavor, potent lemon scent and quick growth cycle. TGA advises that Querkle grows short and especially fast in soil -- and even faster in hydroponic systems -- with a flowering time of 56 days. The strain’s colas are spear-shaped with long orange hairs. Subcool said Querkle was originally bred and grown indoors, then later tested as a crop both indoors and outdoors.

OG Kush appeared when breeder Matt “Bubba” Burger brought his Florida-grown strain to new, indoor settings engineered by California’s JoshD of JoshD Farms. The OG stood for “original,” and indicated the strain was part of the ’92 cut grown by Burger and his team. From there, Ganja Guru moved a step further with Tahoe OG, selecting phenotypes based on THC levels and trichome density. Its desirability earned the cultivar 3rd place for Best Indica at the 2011 Cannabis Cup. Tahoe OG grows short and squat, reaching heights of 4 feet in 8-9 weeks of indoor growing. Advanced growers should harvest from the top down, allowing lower buds to gain more light exposure. The strain reeks long before cutting, with alpha-Pinene and humulene contributing to its signature Kush aroma."

Reportedly introduced around 2008, and among the first high-CBD strain, Cannatonic is a cross of Reina Madre and NYC Diesel. The strain took 3rd Sativa at the 2008 High Times Cannabis Cup and is primarily recommended for medicinal use. The seed bank offers three main phenotypes of the strain — one with a 1:1 THC-to-CBD ratio, one with high CBD and low THC and one with a high THC-to-CBD ratio. It spawned several notable phenotypes, including Cannatonic #4, Cannatonic X and Cannatonic B, and Highlo, a Cannatonic IBL from House of the Great Gardener. One of the earliest phenotypes to carry its own name, SuperCBDx, was developed by breeder PJ after he contracted a serious illness and focused on high-CBD strains, which are commonly used for medicinal purposes. From there, it was reportedly refined by Spanish seed bank Genofarm, whose version boasts a 26:1 CBD-to-THC ratio. Cannatonic has also served as the genetic base for several CBD-rich hybrids including Cancer’s Nightmare (Cannatonic and White Nightmare) from Sin City Seeds, CannaBerry (Cannatonic and Blackberry) from Apothecary Genetics, Hawkeye (Cannatonic and Mt. Rainer) from RedEyed Genetics, Hazy Med CBD (Super Silver Haze, Skunk #1 and Cannatonic) from Poppa Pain Strains, and VCDC from Moxie Seeds. Resin Seeds’ own Dieseltonic is a backcrossing of Cannatonic and NYC Diesel, and has the same CBD potential as Cannatonic. Cherry Wine and The Wife, two hemp strains commonly grown in the USA, are also Cannatonic hybrids. Resin Seeds estimates that 80% or more of all American, Swiss, and Italian grown hemp varieties include Cannatonic in their lineage. When cultivating Cannatonic, its breeder reports Indica-like growth patterns and a 63-70 day flowering period. There’s minimal genetic variation, according to tests from Phylos Bioscience.

457,phantom-og,"Not much is known about Purple Urkle’s origin story, except that it first appeared in the 1980s. Some online sources claim that the cultivar’s heritage can be traced back to Mendocino Purps, a well-known cannabis strain produced in Northern California’s Emerald Triangle. Others speculate that Purple Urkle could be a phenotype of either Mendocino Purps or Granddaddy Purple. Regardless of its origin, Purple Urkle’s resplendent purple coloring, due to a healthy amount of anthocyanins, undoubtedly contributed to its name. Lab tests indicate larger percentages of the terpene myrcene contribute to Purple Urkle’s earthy, musky aromas, while the presence of alpha-pinene counteract the terpene’s more sedative effects. Users compliment Purple Urkle for its berry flavors and its impressive THC content, which clocks in between 17-22%, depending on grow conditions. Purple Urkle takes its time to mature — flowering around 8 weeks when grown indoors, though it will flourish in outdoor environments, too. Best for intermediate growers, Purple Urkle requires attention to nutrition and environmental conditions to yield flowers at their most potent."

484,fruit-loops,"According to actor and comedian Seth Rogen, the Pineapple Express cultivar didn’t exist until after the 2008 movie of the same name brought the name into the spotlight. Inspired by the film, growers took it upon themselves to create a potent cultivar that the film described as “the dopest dope.” G13 Labs claims it originated the strain in the mid-2000s, selecting Trainwreck and Hawaiian as parent genetics, and the hybrid soon proliferated among California medical marijuana dispensaries. However, many growers and 11 seed banks each aimed to create the “true” Pineapple Express. As such, multiple variations exist in the current marketplace. Despite the nebulous marketing and inconsistent reported effects, most cuts of Pineapple Express are sought-after cultivars noted for their fluffy, lean flowers that shine with a lime and yellow coloring.

Developed by West Coast seed bank TGA Genetics, the goal was producing a fruity-smelling hybrid with lemon flavor undertones to pair with its classic Kush taste. TGA co-founder Subcool said the recipe was perfected in 2007 by pollinating a clone-only female -- Hell’s OG that was held by Norstar Genetics -- with pollen from a Jack the Ripper male. Jesus OG has two main phenotypes: one with more limonene, which results in a lemony scent reflective of the strain’s Northern Lights #5 ancestry, and one with more Kush-dominant genetics that results in a pinene-dominant terpene profile. The high-limonene phenotype is reportedly the more commercial of the two. TGA reports cultivators of Jesus OG can expect tall growth and massive yields -- especially when planting outdoors -- with a 50-63 day flowering time. Jesus OG’s leaves are bright green, and its flowers are dense with waxy, trichome-riddled surfaces and prominent orange hair clusters. Breeder Subcool describes the Jesus OG high as intoxicating, yet thought-provoking, alleviating pain and providing mental clarity. The strain was used by breeder Jinxproof to create the 9lb Hammer, which won a cannabis cup in 2017."

Like most sativas, Headbanger has a long flowering time of 10-12 weeks. Once harvest time arrives, each plant yields 18-21 ounces."
639,headbanger,"With a name as mysterious and intriguing as Midnight, it’s no wonder two iterations of the strain exist on the cannabis market. MIDNIGHT BY TIKUN OLAM The strains Israel-based breeder Tikun Olam used to created their version of Midnight are a secret known only to the company. Sources online say the strain has an earthy, blueberry scent and slightly herbal aftertaste. Midnight has 8% THC and 11% CBD, suggesting mitigated psychoactive effects in keeping with Tikun Olam’s pursuit of medicinal cannabis. Since the company keeps a tight lid on all information except the availability of Midnight, there’s little growing information available. The buds are green and purple in coloring with a sugary coat of trichomes. Presumably, Midnight has good yields as it was developed for commercial production. MIDNIGHT BY VANCOUVER ISLAND SEED COMPANY Midnight is a cross of The Black and Fucking Incredible created by Vancouver Island Seed Company.

In the late 1990s, Mr. Soul -- founder of Brothers Grimm Seeds -- discovered a few seeds inside a Jack Herer bud that he purchased in an Amsterdam coffee shop. He grew one into a cultivar named Princess, which reportedly provided a much more psychedelic experience than other strains on the market at the time. From there, he aimed to create a super-strain that would allow him to share Princess with the world. First, he paired a Princess female with a Shiva Skunk male to add plant strength, and used a triple backcrossing method called “cubing” to create the parent strain Cinderella 88. Finally, he bred Cinderella 88 with Princess once more to achieve what breeders call the Holy Grail of Hybrids -- Cinderella 99. The name Cinderella comes from the fairy tale heroine, who -- much like the cultivar -- had modest beginnings, but bloomed into royalty. Consumers savor the strain for its fruity, floral aroma, thanks to a hefty presence of linalool. Both novice and experienced breeders should find the strain easy to grow, with higher yields and resistance to common diseases.

Propagated by JJ Edwards of Top Dawg Seeds in 2011, Star Dawg is said to express a couple of phenotypes, one of which is considered Indica-dominant and the other considered to be Sativa-dominant. While the most famous StarDawg pheno, the Guava cut, won first place in the Best Sativa category at the 2012 Denver High Times Medical Cannabis Cup, the strain has been updated and reissued four times since 2011. The newest variations from StarDawg’s gene pool are referred to as the Illuminati, Corey Haim, and Kate Upton cuts. Despite sharing the same gene pool, each cut provides a slightly different flavor profile, smell, effect, plant structure, and flowering time. Of the varied cuts, Kate Upton is the most purple, Guava is the sweetest and produces the heaviest yields, while the Corey Haim and Illuminati cuts are claimed to be the most potent. Dependent on the cut of StarDawg cultivated, the strain will either produce a short, compact, fast-flowering, Indica-dominant plant; or a fast-stretching, rapidly blossoming, Sativa-dominant plant. Indoors, the Sativa-leaning cut of Stardawg will finish flowering in roughly 63-73 days, while outdoor cultivators will need to wait until early October in the Northern Hemisphere, or early April in the Southern Hemisphere before they can harvest. The Indica-dominant cut of StarDawg, grown either indoors or outdoors, will take roughly 65 days to fully mature after entering the flowering period."

1013,lemon-cookies,"Purple Dragon’s origins are nearly as mythical as its namesake. Some breeders speculate this violet-hued flower was created by crossing Purple Urkle, a California classic from the 1980s, with Blue Dragon, a hybrid of Sour Diesel and Blueberry. Others still believe Purple Dragon to be a self-pollinated Purple Urkle descendant. Though Sour Diesel’s presence in its heritage is up for debate, Purple Dragon produces effects reported to be less sedating than what is commonly associated with Indica-characteristic cultivars. Consumers report favoring Purple Dragon for its bubblegum-like sweet flavor and musky earth aroma, likely due to its humulene content."

1018,willy-wonka,"OG Kush is a world-famous strain first propagated by Matt Berger in Florida. The strain was later popularized after JoshD was able to perfect the growing conditions and introduce the variety into the Los Angeles market. JoshD Farms reports OG Kush users can expect long-lasting, heavy, yet versatile euphoria and skunky-citrus flavor and aroma. The company is now focused exclusively on developing OG Kush-derived strains and products. JoshD Farms reports an average THC content of 20% from OG Kush, with some indoor grows testing as high as 26%. Myrcene, Limonene, and caryophyllene are the dominant terpenes of the strain. According to JoshD Farms, phenotypes and offspring that honor OG Kush’s signature effect and flavor profile include Kosher Kush, Triangle Kush, Skywalker OG, and Loompa’s Headband. Matt Berger said he obtained the originating strain, a ’90s favorite of Snoop Dogg and B-Real of Cypress Hill, in Florida where it was shared exclusively among local growers under the name Kryptonite, or Krippy, to designate its alleged Seattle origins. It was shipped from Seattle to Florida in dense bricks and also referred to as Supernaut and Kush. Del Rosso said the strain was passed between Florida breeders Alec Anderson and Matt “Bubba” Berger in 1992. Berger, who was the first to cultivate Kush seeds in Florida from a random bag of flower, later shared the strain with Del Rosso in Los Angeles. Berger was also reportedly the first to coin the name Kush after a friend called the strain’s especially frosty colas “Kushberries,” with no intentional reference to the Hindu Kush mountains where other “Kush” strains originate. OG Kush also came in 1st place for the Weedmaps March Madness competition in 2020. Del Rosso was the first to cultivate Kush in California, sharing cuttings with friends and fellow growers, and renaming it OG Kush (OG being short for “Original,” not “Ocean Grown” or “Original Gangster” as is often rumored) to differentiate his Florida plant from phenotypes cultivated by other breeders. When OG Kush first started to proliferate through the market, many growers reproduced the plant without the right indoor grow conditions, and the results often have varied in quality, effect, and flavor profile. OG Kush is meant to signify that the strain was grown properly by Josh and his original crew of breeders. JoshD also reports that OG Kush is difficult to grow because it’s highly sensitive to changes in light and nutrient levels and can be susceptible to pests. Successful growers will find OG Kush has a 58-day flowering period and develops sizable yields of triangle-shaped colas covered in oily, shiny trichomes. Sugar leaves are green with streaks of lavender and pink. Testing from Phylos Bioscience reveals moderate genetic variation in the strain."

1020,sour-alien,"For Deep Ellum Seed Co., a Colorado-based breeder which originally started in Texas, The Black is its flagship strain. The Black is a cross of indigenous Mexican strains from Michoacán and Oaxaca mixed with Afghan and Green Vietnamese, which was created by breeder Dr. Dank in 2005. According to the breeder, a deal was made with a Canadian seed bank that later claimed The Black as its own. While purple phenos had been bred out by Deep Ellum earlier on during the development phase, the backcrosses from stabilizing this strain caused the trait to re-emerge and ultimately embraced by the original creators. The dark foliage and underground history of all the parents led to the name. According to the Canadian seed bank BC Bud Depot, The Black has a unique, sweet flavor profile. Deep Ellum Seed Co. claims that The Black plants reach medium height despite its sativa-leaning heritage. This strain reportedly does well indoors using the Sea of Green (SOG) technique. The Black is ready for a large harvest following an eight-to-nine-week flowering period. The Black was named a Top Ten Strain of the Year by High Times magazine in 2008."

A cross of DJ Short’s Blueberry F5 strain and Santa Cruz Haze, Blue Dream produces several noteworthy phenotypes and is known to produce varied phenotypes with heavy yields. Origin 2: Blue Dream by Mystic Seeds Blue Dream by Mystic Seeds is an indica-dominant cross of DJ Short’s Blueberry strain crossed with a powerful OG Kush from Los Angeles. Origin 3: Blue Dream by DJ Short A new Blue Dream by DJ Short was reportedly recently created and branded as Azure Haze, after crossing a Silver Haze mother and a Blueberry F4 father. Origin 4: Blue Dream by Humboldt Seed Organization Blue Dream by Humboldt Seed Organization is a sativa-dominant strain derived from feminized seeds. Created from a cross of Blueberry and Super Silver Haze (SSH), this version of Blue Dream is suitable for cultivating indoors or in a greenhouse. Blue Dream by Unknown When cultivated outdoors, Blue Dream hits full maturation by late October in the Northern Hemisphere, late April in the Southern Hemisphere. The strain thrives when grown indoors in a hydroponic environment and finishes flowering about 8 to 10 weeks after the 12/12 light cycle switch, according to Dark Heart Nursery. For a more robust flavor profile, many growers choose to cultivate this strain in soil with organic nutrients. Blue Dream by Mystic Seeds This version of Blue Dream is known for producing a short, dark-green plant that grows slowly in the vegetative phase and produces modest yields. Due to the Kush influence, this variety is an early-stretching plant that takes on more Indica qualities when flowering and finishes with chunky, pungent blue-hued flowers. This version of Blue Dream is considered to be a good commercial strain that’s highly resistant to mold and pests. Blue Dream by DJ Short DJ Short’s version of Blue Dream grows relatively slow during the vegetation cycle and stretches dramatically once the flower cycle begins. Training these plants via the Sea of Green or Screen of Green technique helps to maximize yield. DJ Short’s Blue Dream strain produces dense, rounded flowers that create an above-average yield. Blue Dream by Humboldt Seed Organization The strain’s growth pattern is slender with narrow fan leaves. The light green calyxes turn golden near harvest time and typically produce swollen teardrop-shaped colas that outproduce other versions of this strain. Humboldt Seeds also offers an autoflowering version of Blue Dream that’s ready for harvest about 11 weeks after planting. The autoflowering Blue Dream strain produces a short, bushy plant that produces long side-branches with wide internodal spacing. From seed to smoke, Blue Dream Auto is typically ready for harvest within 75 days of germination.

Its effects are frequently reported as heavily cerebral, uplifting, and energizing. Silver Haze has two origin stories. Origin 1: Silver Haze by Sensi Seeds This Silver Haze originates in the 1980s as a hybrid of Silver Pearl x Haze. Silver Pearl is a hybrid of Early Pearl x Skunk #1/Northern Lights. Origin 2: Silver Haze by Shantibaba and Mr. Nice This Silver Haze originates with breeders Scott Blakey (AKA Shantibaba), Howard Marks (AKA Mr. Nice), and Neville Schoenmaker, who retooled their Super Silver Haze strain — a hybrid of Skunk x Northern Lights x Haze — and called it Silver Haze when they left Greenhouse Seed Company. Silver Haze won the bronze for Best Sativa in the 2005 High Times Cannabis Cup while its closest relative, Super Silver Haze, has won countless awards. The original Haze was an early hybrid that could only be grown outdoors, due to its minimal yield and unmanageable height-gain. Crossing the unruly Haze with the Afghani Indica Northern Lights #5 stabilizes the growth patterns of Silver Haze for high yields in a controlled, indoor growing environment. Growers can still expect significant, albeit manageable, height-gain from Silver Haze during its relatively long 65-75 day flowering period. Near the end of flowering, Silver Haze’s buds grow dense — packed with frosty, silver trichomes and long, flowing orange hairs."

The potentially arousing effects of Sexxpot are complemented by sensual flavors of berry, coffee, and all around sweetness with aromas to match. THC levels are relatively low, hovering around 15%, so users can enjoy this strain day or night. Sturdy stalks and a manageable height make Sexxpot easy to grow for newbies. Pruning is a must, but this plant can withstand sudden shifts in temperature and humidity, which means it’s a safe bet to grow outdoors. Flowers bud at 7 to 9 weeks indoors with appealing colors of jade, lavender, and cobalt on bold display."

1056,golden-state-banana,"Glass Slipper is a fairytale strain created in the Netherlands by breeders at Riot Seeds. It’s widely believed the team at Riot Seeds backcrossed a Cinderella 99 F1 male from Brothers Grimm Seeds’ original seed pack with a Cinderella 99 phenotype named Pineapple. However, other sources claim Cinderella 99 was paired with breeder Krome’s The White. Regardless of origin, Glass Slipper earned a name for itself among consumers thanks to its reported pungently fruity bouquet and sweet, berry flavors. The strain flowers indoors at 9-to-10 weeks, and in late September to early October when planted outside. It grows up to 6 feet, thriving best in a Mediterranean climate. Breeders recommend training the plant to grow by pruning and bending the branches early in the flowering cycle. Topping is also recommended to allow light to reach the lower branches."

1062,pamelina,"While most online sources seem to agree that Super Jack was originally bred by Southseeds, some disagree on the exact lineage of this sativa-leaning hybrid. Most tend to fall into one of two prominent camps. Super Jack was reportedly bred by Amsterdam seed bank Southseeds, which crossed its own Silver Skunk with Jack Herer. Although the origins of Super Jack are up for debate, most online seed banks appear to stock this Jack Herer and Silver Skunk cross. Other sources claim that Super Jack is a cross of Jack Herer and Super Silver Haze instead of Silver Skunk, a similar, yet slightly different genetic mix than the other version. The Super Jack strain from Southseeds produces high yields of large, medium-density buds. During the 60-to-70-day flowering period, copious amounts of highly aromatic resin blanket the colas, producing an aromatic fusion of lemon and pepper. The strain is suitable for either indoor or outdoor grows, and responds well to most grow media. Growers can expect this version of Super Jack to grow to a height between 50 centimeters to 1 meter , or 1.6 to 3.3 feet, and producing harvests of 400 to 500 grams per square meter. The strain reportedly grows short and produces sizeable yields of large, spade- shaped buds sticky with resin in a 49-to-56- day flowering period. Super Jack may grow broad fan leaves that require trimming to ensure enough nutrients get to the lower flowers."
1063,super-jack,"Strawberry Dream is a strain of unknown origins thought to be a combination of Strawberry Cough and Blue Dream. It reportedly features a sweet strawberry flavor undercut by an earthy skunk. Its aroma matches its flavor, with a pungent stink flattened by its berry sweetness.

1065,black-afghan,"Smoke like the multi-hyphenate rapper-businessman Berner and try the Gary Payton strain. For a glimpse into the cultivation process, look no further than Cookies breeder Kenny Powers’ story of choosing the name Gary Payton. What is now known as Gary Payton was formerly “strain number 20” of many phenotypes he was testing. Strain number 20 stood out, and it just so happened to be Gary Payton’s old number. Fun fact: Cookies worked with Gary Payton to license and bring this strain to the market. If you’re familiar with Gary Payton’s revered NBA career, then you might expect this strain to feel like a full-court press, but it’s said to be quite balanced. Gary Payton reportedly delivers relaxed energy that eases body pain while providing mental clarity."
1066,gary-payton,"Blueberry Pancakes is an indica-leaning hybrid of somewhat mysterious origins. It’s a cross of DJ Short Blueberry and a mystery indica.

1069,silver-bubble,"Black Widow is an Indica-leaning hybrid of Brazilian and south Indian landraces that was originally cultivated by breeder Scott Blakey -- aka Shantibaba -- under the name White Widow. When Blakey and breeder Howard Marks -- aka Mr. Nice -- left Green House Seed Company in the late 1990s, they changed the name to Black Widow to distinguish their plant from White Widow strains sold by other seed banks. Today -- as noted by its Dutch seed bank, Mr. Nice Seeds -- Black Widow is an easy-to-grow plant that offers decent yields of frosty, resinous buds in a 56-70 day flowering period. It was a 1st Place winner at the 1995 High Times Cannabis Cup. The seed bank recommends indoor, hydroponic, or greenhouse growing. Growers should expect vigorous development of resin frost and a strong aroma during the final weeks of flowering. Both regular and feminized Black Widow seeds are available from Mr. Nice."

This high roller boasts a THC content of nearly 26%, reportedly lulling consumers into euphoric states of sleepy sedation. Road Dawg delights the palate with minty, diesel flavors that are accompanied by a sour chemical smell. Road Dawg thrives both indoors and outdoors but requires a slightly longer flowering period than other indica strains — around 9-11 weeks when grown inside. The plants' branches tend to get heavy, so some structural support may be needed. Road Dawg produces beautiful, mint-green flowers with thick pistils and a blanket of golden trichomes."
1074,road-dawg,"Hemlock is a balanced hybrid strain most commonly found in Colorado dispensaries. The top reported aromas are earthy notes with citrus undertones and a chemical, ammonia-like scent. The top reported flavors are diesel and citrus with hints of the chemical undertones. Hemlock is a cross of the sativa-strong Durban Poison and the indica-dominant LA Confidential. Hemlock is a fairly easy strain to grow, even for amateur growers. Hemlock plants don't require extreme care, although it responds well to pruning. It grows into a short, stocky plant with a high yield that flowers over a period of 10 weeks. Although it is easy to grow, finding seeds or clippings from mature plants may prove fairly difficult, as they are not widely available on the market."
1075,hemlock,"Red Headed Stranger is a cross of Willy’s Wonder and Haze, and takes its name from the Willie Nelson album that came to be his nickname, according to Kind Love clone shop. It tends to act quickly and produce uplifting, energizing effects, according to Pacific Seeds. Red Headed Stranger won Best Sativa in the Colorado High Times Cannabis Cup in 2012.

Jean Guy flowers in about 70 days indoors and by mid-October in outdoor gardens. In ideal conditions, Jean Guy produces yields of approximately 12 ounces per plant, a below-average yield. Jean Guy is available as seeds only. Clones may be available directly from cultivators growing this strain."
1077,jean-guy,"A reported cross between the classic sativa-leaning Sour Diesel and Mango Haze, which was bred by Mr. Nice Seeds, the original breeders of the seemingly rare Sour Mango strain remains a mystery. But as its name indicates, this well-balanced hybrid strain boasts a tropical aroma of rotten mangoes and diesel fuel. Information on this strain is limited, but a select few growers have written about cultivating Sour Mango using the auto-flowering method. During the vegetative stage, the plant is said to grow rapidly, followed by a 65-to-67-day flowering cycle. The sativa-heavy lineage of Sour Mango causes the plant to grow taller than 6 feet, or nearly 2 meters, under certain conditions and produce high yields of airy, skyscraper-like colas. Once cured, growers are left with bright-green buds that have rust-colored hairs, translating to a sweet and sour tropical medley upon consumption. Seeds or clones of the Sour Mango strain are hard to come by and don’t appear to be readily available online."
1078,sour-mango,"Gorilla OG, also known as Gorilla Mango or Gorilla Mango OG, is a limited-edition cross of GG#4 (Gorilla Glue #4) and Tahoe Kush created by the breeders at Dr. Underground. Other online sources claim that the true breeder is unknown and that Gorilla OG may instead have Mango Kush or OG Cookies as the second parent. Regardless of origin, Gorilla OG features a blend of fruit, citrus, and diesel aromas. Gorilla OG is ready for harvest by nine weeks, producing dark leaves with white, trichome-covered buds. Though some buds appear around 7-8 weeks, patience is a virtue with Gorilla OG to tease the most resin out of its buds."
1079,gorilla-og,"The Cube is an indica-dominant strain from Exotic Genetix based out of Tacoma, Washington. The top reported flavors are anise and sweet fruit with hints of earth and cherry.

1080,the-cube,"Area 51 is a strain of mysterious, contested origins. While many sources claim Area 51 is an accidental combination of Cannatonic and Alien Abduction bred in 2010, the breeders at North Genetics have their own version that combines Smurfberry with a Snowdawg x Romulan female. Consumer reports mention Area 51 features an earthy fragrance of pungent citrus and pine with floral notes. Its smoke leans more towards the lemony side with hints of earthy pine. Area 51 leans towards its sativa heritage, growing tall and thin and preferring a semi-humid climate full of warm sunshine. However, skilled growers can help Area 51 thrive in an indoor garden, particularly with hydroponic and the ScrOG method. Plants reach full maturity in 10-12 weeks indoors or in late October outside, producing up to 16 ounces of flower per plant in optimal conditions. Area 51 is available commercially as seeds."

One reported story is that the strain was gifted to TGA Genetics and crossed to create other strains, but the breeding collective did not develop the original Black Cherry Soda strain. Black Cherry Soda plants are reported to grow tall and produce medium to large yields, leading to chunky, resin-laden colas that can take on a lush purple appearance, sometimes without even a hint of green. This strain is said to have an aroma of berries and an earthy undertone, along with a berry-flavored soda-poplike taste that ultimately inspired its name. One batch of the Black Cherry Soda cultivar, grown by the Washington state-based cannabis cultivator Mad Mark Farms, was tested by Confidence Analytics and had THC levels that exceeded 26%."
